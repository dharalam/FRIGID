Kathy Hochul targets a state law that allows people who might not be in the U.S. legally to get driver\u2019s licenses. The so-called Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\n\tThe lawsuit describes the law as \u201ca frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.\" It highlights a provision that requires the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information. The Justice Department is asking the court to strike down the law.\n\n\t\u201cThis is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans,\u201d said Bondi, with agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration lined up behind her. \u201cMillions of illegal aliens with violent records have flooded into our communities, bringing violence and deadly drugs with them.\u201d\n\n\tBondi\u2019s politically charged rhetoric, unusual for an institution that has historically been wary of aligning itself so directly with the White House, and the selection of legal targets raise fresh concerns that she could seek to use the agency\u2019s law enforcement powers to go after the president\u2019s adversaries. James, the New York attorney general, has drawn Trump\u2019s ire by suing him, leading to a civil fraud judgment that stands to cost Trump nearly $500 million.\n\n\tJames said in a statement that she's prepared to defend the state's laws, which she said \u201cprotect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe.\u201d\n\n\tAvi Small, a spokesperson for Hochul, said the governor \u201dhas been clear from day one: she supports deporting violent criminals who break our laws, believes that law-abiding families should not be targets, and will coordinate with federal authorities who have a judicial warrant.\"\n\n\tBondi appeared alongside Tammy Nobles, whose 20-year-old daughter Kayla was killed in Aberdeen, Maryland, in July 2022 by someone from El Salvador who entered the country illegally months earlier in Texas. The assailant, then 16, was released to a first cousin to pursue asylum, which is common practice under U.S. law and policy. He had been accused by authorities in El Salvador of affiliation with the violent MS-13 gang, according to a report by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\tTo trumpet his immigration policies, Trump has often highlighted \u201cangel moms\u201d like Nobles, who lost their loved ones to violent crimes by people in the country illegally.\n\n\t\u201cTammy represents not only herself and her family but all of the great angel moms around this country who have suffered because of what the Biden administration did,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\n\tThe lawsuit comes days after the Justice Department sued the city of Chicago, alleging that its \u201c sanctuary\u201d laws were thwarting federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.\n\n\tIn 2020, the Trump administration sought to pressure New York into changing its law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\n\tNew York\u2019s governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn\u2019t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove legal residency in the U.S.\n\n\tThe Trump administration ultimately restored New Yorkers\u2019 access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.", "Hochul released a statement, saying, \"Earlier today, Attorney General Pam Bondi marched in front of the television cameras for a dramatic media briefing to announce she was filing charges against New York State related to our immigration laws.
