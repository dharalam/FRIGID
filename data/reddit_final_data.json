Don't do anything illegal or that will get you hurt, but waste their time if you can. \n\nRemember: Immigrant or not: YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEAK WITH THEM. Don't speak without a lawyer present. Don't answer questions. Demand and verify real warrants because they do try to trick people with ICE warrants that are not valid. Don't let them into your home or place of business. \n\nThere are ICE agents that have and will pose as police officers, pretend to be part of specific precincts, etc. Approach EVERYTHING with caution. \n\nAnd just please be kind to one another right now.\n\nEdit from anyjane21: Judicial warrants will be signed by a judge and says United States District Court at the top. \nWhen reviewing warrants-details matter, pay attention to the date, time, and place the warrant specifies. \n\nThe National Immigrant Legal Center has information  on determining the differences between judicial and administrative warrants. https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Warrants-Subpoenas-Facts.pdf\n\nEdit from feelitrealgood: A handy guide to help prepare workplaces \n\nhttps://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/EmployerGuide-NELP-NILC-2017-07-1.pdf\n\n\nEdit 3: I am not arguing with you blockheads!!
