How is safety where you guys live at? here in North Elizabeth is not safe at all, since the number of immigrants has increased the unsafety as well. Next to my house there was a robbery and multiple crimes in Jackson Ave... this is getting worse	""	0.84	https://reddit.com/r/elizabethnj/comments/vnm0s2/how_is_safety_where_you_guys_live_at_here_in/	7	vnm0s2	2022-06-29 18:01	"What does immigrants have to do ? Stop with the wild disrespect because it can catch up to you. Immigrants actually be working 6/7 days a week and go home ans actually enjoy family time. What it be is the lazy as privileged mofos who dont work and rely on a monthly check and when it runs out they rob and steal. Even these young kids with bad parenting letting their kid grow up in the street being raised by someone older that is also an individual with no motivation to work and just looks for the easy way out passing down his out look on life and now those kids with no guidance or someone to make sure they stay busy in a positive place run wild trying to prove that they are worth something and to be accepted amongst others.
I know tell me about it. I live 4th and e.jersey
Are there any groups where we can take care of each other? Or when we see something happen we can alert the rest?
I lived in Elizabeth 42 years, my whole life. There has always been immigrants on Elizabeth Ave and broad Street but now more than ever

Same Jackson Ave a lot of shit going on, but I've seen more crimes not from immigrants only but also from African Americans (They are also immigrants, I guess but with papers)
Get out of here,lol. Your my neighbor.
I think there is an app that connects you with the Elizabeth PD"
