ICE Raids@"I know a post about the one in Newark got a lot of attention, but I heard there were also raids in Vineland and East Brunswick. Exactly how true this is, I cannot say as of right now, so take it lightly, but stay alert nonetheless.

MORE SIGHTINGS IN LAKEWOOD, NEPTUNE/ASBURY, LONG BRANCH, BELMAR AND NEW BRUNSWICK TRAIN STATION ( 1/24/25 )

HOUSE TO HOUSE RAIDS IN PLEASANTVILLE, RIGHT OUTSIDE OF AC. ( 1/24/25 )

SIGHTING AT RUTGERS NEW BRUNSWICK. ( 1/24/25 )

Please, please be careful, everyone. 

If you have the ability to safely do so: Distract ICE agents. Don't do anything illegal or that will get you hurt, but waste their time if you can. 

Remember: Immigrant or not: YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEAK WITH THEM. Don't speak without a lawyer present. Don't answer questions. Demand and verify real warrants because they do try to trick people with ICE warrants that are not valid. Don't let them into your home or place of business. 

There are ICE agents that have and will pose as police officers, pretend to be part of specific precincts, etc. Approach EVERYTHING with caution. 

And just please be kind to one another right now.

Edit from anyjane21: Judicial warrants will be signed by a judge and says United States District Court at the top. 
When reviewing warrants-details matter, pay attention to the date, time, and place the warrant specifies. 

The National Immigrant Legal Center has information  on determining the differences between judicial and administrative warrants. https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Warrants-Subpoenas-Facts.pdf

ICE Out of New Jersey- No Detention Camp in Newark@"On **Tuesday, March 11th, at 12:00 p.m.** please join leading immigrant justice organizations in a mass demonstration against the plan to reopen Delaney Hall as an ICE jail.

This week has had incredible momentum between a demonstration at Elizabeth Detention Center and a multi-mile march of faith leaders in Newark. We're now bringing the energy to Delaney Hall to reject the mass deportation agenda and affirm our position against immigration detention.

**When:** Tuesday, March 11th, 12:00 p.m.  
**Where:** Delaney Hall, 451 Doremus Ave, Public Sidewalk  
**Who:** Advocates, families affected by detention, YOU!

As if locking up community members for profit wasn't bad enough- the site of this for-profit jail is in the middle of what Newarkers know as ""chemical corridor"". It sits on a property that is deed restricted because of past environmental contamination.

3/3 Protest Outside NJ's Only ICE Detention Center-Elizabeth, NJ@"Tomorrow (Monday) at noon folks will gather in front of NJ's only ICE detention center- 625 Evans St in Elizabeth. As you could expect it has become overcrowded and the conditions, which were always horrible have become horrific (it's a converted warehouse after all). They include spoiled food, Tylenol as one of the only dispensed medicines and a lack of clean drinking water. NJ passed a law in 2021 to close this place down but the private prison that operates the place is fighting NJ in court. Another private prison company, GEO Group, wants to open another one 3 times the size in Newark. The thing is- the more local detention space ICE has- the more arrests they can make. 

NJ residents were clear when we lobbied for our anti-ICE detention law. We don't want any of these places in our state!"@0.78@https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1j253qk/33_protest_outside_njs_only_ice_detention/@17@1j253qk@2025-03-02 23:46

If you are ever harassed by people pretending to be LEO or ICE....@"If you don't look ""right"" and some people pretend to be ICE agent or any other law enforcement agents such as CBP, know the following: 

1. under N.J. Stat. § 2C:28-8, a. Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, **a person commits a disorderly persons offense if he falsely pretends to hold a position in the public service with purpose to induce another to submit to such pretended official authority or otherwise to act in reliance upon that pretense.**

b. A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if he falsely pretends to hold a position as an officer or member or employee or agent of any organization or association of law enforcement officers with purpose to induce another to submit to such pretended official authority or otherwise to act in reliance upon that pretense.

The fines can be as low as 1,000, and as high as 10,000 with max 6 month prison time. 

There are crazy people out there who are neither smart nor dedicated enough to actually be a federal LEO but want to LARP as one to exercise nonexistent power over people like us.

N.J. teachers wear ‘Gulf of America’ shirts to school. Controversy ensues.@"The shirts were worn during a dress-down day Jan. 31 at Belleville High School.

The T-shirts apparently referenced an executive order from President Donald Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America. Some say the move has caused tension with the largely Latino school community.

Another teacher at Belleville High School took to social media to denounce what she called an attempt to bully Latino students who fear Trump’s threatened Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

“Our student body has been suffering, crying, coming into school, emails from kids saying their parents are not letting come back for fear that they get picked up by ICE raids,” the Belleville teacher said in the post. “Our job is to support these kids and reassure them the school is safe place and to come here. I feel as if those t-shirts at Belleville High School are sending a clear-cut message to these kids in order to intimidate them and to bully them.”

Belleville High School is 73% Hispanic, according to the latest state Department of Education data."@0.94@https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1ik0ln0/nj_teachers_wear_gulf_of_america_shirts_to_school/@256@1ik0ln0@2025-02-07 17:33
200+ show up in solidarity with the NAACP before the Hunterdon County Board of Commissioners with a resolution to restrict ICE to its legal powers within its borders.@"
Hunterdon County is the red heart of District 7, which flipped to Republican Tom Kean Jr. in 2022, but described by one eloquent speaker tonight, ""bleeds red, blue, purple.""

I may have been in the courthouse as a friend who saw a flyer on Instagram, so I don't know how we all got there, but I do know that we all did! Every age, every party, every demographic that exists in one of the most diverse states in America, crammed into a hallway that definitely wasn't meant to hold all of us. Personally, I've mostly seen the courthouse from the street-- its giant steps and stone pillars are memorable even if you're not from Flemington.

As testified tonight by Mayor Baraka of Newark, ICE raids in Newark have resulted in the unlawful detention of U.S citizens, including a war veteran who was harassed by agents before being released. ICE has continued to close in the area, with known checkpoints like nearby Manville and South Plainfield in Somerset County common targets. The resolution proposed tonight demonstrates Hunterdon County's commitment to restricting ICE to its legal powers such as residents not being subjected to unlawful search and seizure.

I'll disclaim here that I'm not a speaker for the NAACP, nor did I even get a chance to read the resolution tonight-- but what I did get a chance to see was the power in my community. At least two dozen speakers stood up tonight, some prepared, some not, yet every single one concerned with what our country is starting to look like. Business owners. Charity organizers. Veterans. Judges. Students. Teachers.

As others have said tonight-- the resolution being passed is an extremely low bar. Being one of the safest counties in the United States makes it lower. All that's being asked of our representatives is to hold ICE accountable; yet the fact that we have to do so when the real criminals are stealing secure data off of Treasury servers makes it necessary.

The least we can do is send a message to people beyond our local level that no one is immune to the law-- and even we can agree on that."@0.91@https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1ii2z66/200_show_up_in_solidarity_with_the_naacp_before/@3@1ii2z66@2025-02-05 05:29

NJ people, if you really care about the US and its greatness, PLEASE read this post.@"I am an immigrant (thankfully not the one ICE is interested in) and a scientist in industry.

We live in a quite uncertain time, and I am admittedly a lot more unnerved now that I ever was in 2016-2020. I see a lot of posts across Reddit about anti ICE/pro-DACA protests. That's great and all, but as someone who is more familiar with immigration laws, the chance is that none of these will actually help us or them. Also, *ICE has no realistic manpower to actually deport all the illegal immigrants.* DHS and USCIS data shows that the removal number in January 2025 is *lower* than that of Biden or Obama administration. Calling state reps or senates don't do anything.

But there are issues that you may actually influence.

As a scientist in the industry, my colleagues and I *heavily rely on* academia. I m sure folks like me know already but industry research is mostly for profits, while academic research is for knowledge. We cannot exist without the each other. Forget about the ""BIG PHARMA"" or ""EVIL CHEMICAL"" for a second. The current administration, mostly by DOGE, is single handedly attempting, and more effectively than the last term. damaging very important government agencies: NIH, NSF, FDA, NASA.

NIH is the core public health and medical research agency with its origin from **1887**, and it is a huge agency that deals with every aspect of government research: funding, travel, conference, regulation, grant review, everything you can imagine. For reasons that we still don't know (well we do know, it's part of Project 2025 to dismantle federal government, but it doesn't benefit Americans regardless where you come from), NIH has been the first target of DOGE and **they froze grants, loans, communications, all suspensions of meetings and conferences, travels, meaning that all staff members are essentially forced to half their work entirely. Hiring freezing and communication freezing isn't abnormal, but a total halting of the financial aspects is extreme if not completely unheard of.  They are also threatening to mass-lay off the NIH workers (https://www.eenews.net/articles/science-funding-agency-threatened-with-mass-layoffs/)**

Similar thing is happening to NSF, National Science Foundation. **In fact, they have recently release a list of words that will cause a grant revoke (see here** https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1ih8kp3/list\_of\_banned\_words\_being\_sent\_to\_nsf\_pos/). The majority the words are very common apolitical descriptions that the administration deems to ""woke"" for them. The salary payments for NSF has restored, but the concern still persists.

FDA also has become a target, the agency that is relevant to you so that you can safely eat food from walmart that was shipped several hundred to thousand miles away from your home....things we take for granted. **Phyllis Fong, the inspector general of the US Department of Agriculture, was forcibly removed from her office in January 2025 after refusing to accept a termination notice from the Trump administration during the investigation into Neuralink's data protection and quality control. (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/elon-musks-foe-phyllis-fong-who-was-investigating-his-brain-implant-startup-neuralink-forcefully-removed-from-office-after-refusing-to-comply-with-the-conditions-of-her-termination/articleshow/117744390.cms?from=mdr)**

These are just a few issues, and there are other agencies like DOE, SSA and USAID that DOGE seemingly has extremely questionable accesses but I am not familiar with these agencies so I will just stop here. Despite what culture war vultures try to tell you, NIH and NSF are extremely important bastion of knowledge and research that contributed to the US' scientific prowess. In fact, NIH GENERATERS **2.47$ per 1$ SPENT!** So the typical ""money bleeding argument' doesn't even fit here. FDA deregulation will further potentially endanger the consumers even more by allowing unscrupulous companies to declare untested, unverified claims to swindle everyone.

If I *sound* alarmist, that's cool. But these strategic destabilization of greatest federal agencies will damage American's reputation as a powerhouse of science and its overall global standing, and subsequently higher education and innovation. IT WILL NOT BENEFIT ANYBODY. This is not an issue of left and right. 

Write and call your state rep and senates. Anybody. Of all the crazy things that the Trump administration will do, these will be *the* worst."@0.88@https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1ij3xsw/nj_people_if_you_really_care_about_the_us_and_its/@124@1ij3xsw@2025-02-06 14:35
