Can Dentists Prioritize Client Appts. Based on Their Insurance?,"Hi. Dental appt. the other day. Cleaning is a year overdue, extractions are overdue, and a few new cavities exist. They want to do my fillings next week, yet won't do my cleanings until November 2025. I'm not comfortable that this is best practice, perhaps increases the chance of infection and poor matching of fillings to natural teeth. Due to recent medical issues in the house one of my insurances is Medicaid. Thanks to someone else's insights I called the office back and asked if I paid cash could they move my cleaning up. They stumbled over themselves and told me I had to call Monday to talk to the finance person ü§Ø. They operate like big business, trying to make their quotas. It should have had a yes or no answer. The level of concern here is disturbing. I definitely have an escaleted health concern. Better yet, my guy is having a heart procedure in a few weeks. We just got to date two days ago. I want to make sure his cleaning was caught up before the procedure. They didn't even bat an eye when they said that we're not doing any cleanings till November. Yet, when I offer to throw cash at them they'll give a sh#$? More details on Monday. Mantra... Do no harm. Really?!!!

Contact assembly member John Allen to support bill banning tourist helicopters flying from NJ airports,"In Hoboken, Jersey City, Weehawken, and Union City we listen to non stop tourist helicopters flying at 300-900 feet overhead all day long. They fly mostly from Kearny NJ as tourist trips to photograph NYC. They fly dangerously close to buildings and low over highly populated residential areas. I hope the others in NJ can help us support this bill.  The bill, A1371, sponsored by Assembly members Julio Marenco and Jessica Ramirez, could not be more straightforward: it would require the state‚Äôs Commissioner of Transportation to prohibit tourist helicopter operations at aviation facilities licensed by the State, meaning all heliports.  This would also pull the plug on thousands of sightseeing flights a year that now cross the Hudson and plague New Yorkers.  (A similar bill in the NJ Senate, S454, was introduced in prior sessions but didn‚Äôt make it out of committee.)
Stop the Chop NY/NJ is urging our New Jersey supporters to make calls and/or send emails to key lawmakers to ensure the bill gets a hearing in the Assembly‚Äôs Tourism, Gaming and Fine Arts Committee.  Here are the names and contact info for the committee leadership and other key Assembly members:

I agree it‚Äôs a huge QOL issue here affecting a LOT of people. But yes as you can tell the suburban set simply doesn‚Äôt care, just as they don‚Äôt expect me to support fixing their feeder roads like 80, right?
Why is this wanted?
reposted this on r/NYEXIT because noise pollution is a serious problem.
Why?
It turns out states can‚Äôt regulate air travel between different states and within a few miles of EWR, JFK and LGA. 

It would take a court all of twelve seconds to throw this out if it were passed. Also, there‚Äôs no reason to put people out of business in Atlantic City because you have a problem in Hoboken. 

It‚Äôs a terribly written bill and everyone on it knows that.
I can understand not wanting to live under their flight path all day every day.  I grew up 250 feet from the end of a municipal airport‚Äôs runway.

Are there limits that could work to reach. A compromise?  Restrictions that would not eliminate these rides but reduce the impact on people who live on the flight path?

I did a helicopter ride from Kearny a few years ago.  It will probably be the only time I ever ride in a helicopter.
I'm sure you could find a lot of support from the NYC side to.
Not sure why I should care with all the other stuff going on right now. Isn‚Äôt this good for small businesses in NJ?
Don't bother.  Assemblyman Allen has been a no-show no-do and it on his way out, he does not care.
You‚Äôre gumming up this subreddit with nonsense. This bill won‚Äôt ban rich people from flying helicopters in an out of NYC and the airports to avoid traffic on their way to dividing up your and my descendants‚Äô futures. How exactly does this do much except clear the skies for the entitled? There are way more important issues for our legislators to focus on, like home affordability, collapsing roadways, etc.
I expect the snark and negative comments, this being Reddit and all. If a couple more people care it‚Äôs a win
America in nutshell. Anyway, while I doubt anything will happen here there have been a lot of advancements in recent years helping make new helicopters much quieter. we can hope a lot of these places transition over time, if only because a quieter ride is also better for their customers.
They're loud as fuck. I live near Route 3, and they go back and forth to the city following the highway. Several times an hour on a busy day, and sometimes they're low enough to shake my house.
I live in Hoboken. We have ~60-100 overhead flights a day coming out of Kearny NJ for tour operators flying to NYC. They fly as low as 300 feet usually 500-750 feet. They run all day from 7am sometimes as late as 10pm. I would really appreciate if NJ folks supported this bill
Done
I updated the post explaining
We have been trying that for years and promises made and broken. I get what you‚Äôre saying but we have been there done that. The only option is the nuclear option IMO
It is there but lobbyists and money kill every bill that gets close to reducing the issue
If you could care, I would appreciate it. I think that the detriment to the parks, small businesses with outdoor dining, and the communities they fly over isn‚Äôt worth however much these companies are worth. And I don‚Äôt think that south Kearny has much retail or restraint traffic to benefit from visitors
Who is the best member on the assembly who could help?
They will just fly from somewhere else. The FAA would need to get involved to restrict the airspace. But they won‚Äôt. Plus, those helicopters have been doing that for decades. Did you just move to the area now and discover this?
Yea I doubt that. 300‚Äô unless for the purpose of takeoff or landing is completely illegal. Unless you were dumb enough to buy a house on the approach or departure en of a runway, this shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. And EVEN THEN, you‚Äôre just a dumbass who didn‚Äôt do due diligence buying a home and bought it within the area of an airport.

Edit: was the airport and helicopter traffic already there when you moved there? Or is that a recent development? /s sounds like somebody didn‚Äôt do their research before moving‚Ä¶
Why don't you try Raj Mukherjee, our state Senator?  He has history in the legislature and a lot of clout these days.
I‚Äôve been fighting it for years. I would really appreciate your support if you would give it
I have screenshots of their flight trackers and videos showing it. Not lying here. It‚Äôs really bad. This thread doesn‚Äôt allow posting pictures so I can‚Äôt show here

Grass Seed??,"What is your go to grass type? I am off to buy another bag. Is there a perfect grass for New Jersey? I live in Monmouth co, I don't know if that makes a difference.",0.67,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jmuwln/grass_seed/,3,1jmuwln,2025-03-29 20:04,"The northeast mix from scotts is pretty solid for most of NJ, but it also depends a lot with what you are working with and what your goal is. How close you are to the ocean changes a bunch of things.

Best thing you can do if you are going to attempt anything serious and need some heavy remediation is get a soil test done. Rutgers has a lab that does it, its super easy and cheap, and they will tell you exactly what you need to do to your lawn if you want good results.

If its just ""i want to throw some stuff down for bare spots and hope it works"" you can go with whatever is cheapest at the store in the type of grass you want, there isn't a huge difference there. The important thing is to check the dates on them, there absolutely is a shelf life on grass seed. Just keep it watered and getting the right amount of light for its type. USUALLY you will have better results seeding in late august, where you aren't guessing against mother nature as much and not competing with all of the crap trying to come in on your lawn or worrying about overwatering, but it can be done in the spring if you really stay on it and are super careful about anything else you put down.

Edit: oh as for type, its all about how much sun you get and how much you want to worry about watering it. Pretty much anything that will survive a freeze will grow in our climate if you put the work in. Fescue is probably the easiest if you just want a nice green lawn that keeps its color most of the year, bluegrass generally is what everyone thinks of when they think of a lush lawn, but its picky to grow. Rye is the easiest, but some people don't appreciate the look of it for 8 months out of the year. Thats why mixes are common.
I use ""Water Saver TTTF"" which is a turf type tall fescue that is more drought and heat tolerant than Kentucky Bluegrass. It does not do well in the shade though. At least partial full sun is recommended. No seed is perfect, but this stuff is generally good.
Gotta be a fescue. No watering needs, no lime needs, less disease problems, and many are shade tolerant. And they're so soft."

Ez Pass is a terrible no-good organization, hands down.


Generally, I have been successful getting there things sorted out over the phone with them, but it usually entails a long drawn out process of making multiple calls going back and forth between EzPass and Tolls By Mail.¬† Pro-tip call on Saturday morning, you'll get thru quicker because most people don't realize the office is open on the weekend.


Also, not the best advice, but if it goes to collections you can probably negotiate with the collections agency."
Do you turn off your outdoor lights?,"I live in a middle class Monmouth county shore town. More than half the houses in my development keep their (non-sensor) porch lights on all night and half of those people just never turn them off. That doesn‚Äôt include the dozens of solar lights everyone has littered through their yard. 

Why? Why do I walk my dog at night and feel like I‚Äôm walking down Broadway? Why not sensor lights? They shine in our windows. It‚Äôs light pollution. My neighborhood is hardly a target for cat burglars and jewel thieves. It‚Äôs safe as hell if you lock your doors. Am I just bitching about nothing? Because I would love it to stop annoying me.

It's way darker at night this year and it's kind of nice seeing the stars. Sensor lights don't work well in my experience.
We live in a heavily wooded area. I swear people move into this area, cut down all their trees and are afraid of the dark. My new neighbors backyard is like Mets stadium. We all have minimum 1 acre lots. My bedroom is in the other side of the house and we still need room darkening blinds. Gone are the days of star gazing. If you want to live on a cornfield, please, buy a house on a cornfield!
I am also eastern Monmouth county. Ours are on a timer, they go off at 11pm. I don't want sensor lights - we have too much wildlife going through the front yard at night, they'd constantly be turning on.
My neighborhood IS a target for car theft and break-ins. 

We do leave some outdoor lights on.
I never turned ON my outdoor light till someone walked up to my front door wearing a ski mask, but luckily left because he heard my tv and/or saw my cameras. 

Now mine is on a dusk to dawn timer, but it‚Äôs a low intensity. It‚Äôs also on a covered porch so it shouldn‚Äôt bother anyone.
We have our amber porch lights and then brighter ones on a thermal sensor and I‚Äôll never give those up. We have a few beads that meander around and my dog liked to go out at 3am. There was never a negative encounter but I prefer to never sneak up on a bear. Morris County.
Thank you!!! I‚Äôm in an ocean county coastal town and sooo many people are leaving actual floodlights on outside at all times. They aren‚Äôt even home!!
My porch lights come on at dusk and off at dawn. My wife grew up in a high crime area and had three home invasions as a kid. It lets her sleep better knowing those lights are on all night so someone is less likely to break in thru the front door. 

We have motion sensing lights over the basement door. And the driveway has a motion sensing light, although the sensor seems to have broken so it stays on all night now as well. Eventually I‚Äôll pull out the tall ladder and deal with it but I‚Äôve been too lazy.
I do. Outside lights are bad for the birds.
I'm in western Morris County and I have the same annoyance. 

Is it dramatic and important in the grand scheme of things? No. 

Is it annoying as hell when I'm trying to sleep and lights from the neighbors creep in along the edges of my shades and curtains? Yes.
Mine is on 24/7.  It's not so bright that it's a bother, just enough that I can see when walking up and wrestling with my keys.  

Actually it gets turned off once a year on Halloween night when I've run out of candy
I keep mine on. I like keeping my house lit
Mortis county- all on a timer!
Mine go on and off automatically (they‚Äôre called dusk to dawn).
A few reasons I do it‚Ä¶
-Cost almost nothing with led lights
-Helps prevent people from sneaking around cars/house.
-At night if I hear a sound out front I don‚Äôt have to run downstairs to turn a light on
-I like pulling into my house with the lights on when I get home.
Yes turn off lights for sake of the birds.
In my town we have raccoons... raccoons are very destructive.

Raccoons also don't like light. Our front and back lights stay on all night because it's far cheaper than fixing raccoon damage.
Yes
I have always kept my property well lit at night. 
If I was choosing a house or car to rob I would hit the dark one.
Lighting professional here. Ever since LEDs went mainstream and became less costly, quality and control of lighting fixtures has taken a nosedive. An old school PAR floodlight (typical outdoor bulb with the flat glass front) kept most of the light focused where one needed it. New outdoor LED fixtures just barf light in all directions, including into your neighbor‚Äôs window. 

It‚Äôs annoying to humans, disturbs wildlife, and ruins our collective view of the night sky‚Ä¶studies show more light only contributes to the _perception_ of safety.

Some towns have (or should have) light-trespass ordinances, but few do, and the ‚Äúmore is better‚Äù idea holds sway among the general public.

Concerned about crime? Install motion sensors and/or infrared CCTV cameras. Personal outdoor safety? Low level solar lights carefully chosen to put light on the path, and not produce glare. Or, just carry a pocket size flashlight‚Äîone AA battery can give you more than enough light to walk the dog or watch for ice.
No you‚Äôre not bitching about nothing. I will have to install blackout shades because the neighbors can‚Äôt find their light switch at night. It‚Äôs past energy consumption, it‚Äôs about light pollution at this point
Both my neighbors homes are dark. I have outdoor lighting on my front yard and back yard trees. I feel like if a potential robber came to our neighborhood, they would assume nobody is home at my neighbors and go there first.
The weird thing is people think lighting makes them safer. But criminals aren't vampires, they aren't afraid of lights.
Coastal MonCo here too. 
I have lights that turn off at midnight. Im Anna super busy street with feral cats and raccoons and squirrels, so sensor lights are not the thing for my property. But let me say, the neighborhood not being a target for cat-burglars, as you say, may in deed be a product of the incessant porch lights and the like.
Nope. We have 2 stage LED ones. They stay on at a lower level (just enough that it illuminates the front of the house for looks, that will then kick on to a slightly brighter level if they detect motion (nothing jarring though).

Works out great, i don't even notice them on our electric bill but some back of the napkin math tells me they probably set me back like a dollar a month. 

I put them in when we moved in, i forget what we paid but they couldn't have been expensive if i did them when i did. Still on the original bulbs almost 10 years later too.
Mine isn't a spotlight, but it's mounted under my covered porch it goes on at dusk off at dawn automatically
I have a motion sensitive front porch light. I also have solar string lights strung under the small cluster of trees in thr backyard. It's mostly dark and cozy.

My neighbor has two spotlights near the roof that cover his entire backyard. While little of it intruder on my yard, especially in summer, I still find it annoying.
We have sensor lights on the back and side that I never bother turning on, string lights in the back on a timer, and the front light(one of those yellow ones that supposedly doesn't attract bugs but that was a lie) is dusk to dawn.
I have a sensor light for the side of my house, two lights flanking my front door that are on all night, and I leave a few interior lights on all night as well. So there.
I'm with you except for the solar lights.  The sun is lazy and we need to make it work harder!
I installed side lights with dusk till dawn sensors on them. Haven‚Äôt found a solution for my covered porch light so have to turn it on and off manually.
I do, but they are set to a ""cozy"" setting.
Our outdoor lights stay on until midnight every night. But I see your point. Light pollution is a drag.
If you‚Äôre talking about me, I just moved in, it‚Äôs my first home, we just had a baby and a sensor is the last of my concerns. If I remember, I turn it off. 

But seriously, are you talking about me?
Nah, fuck em.
My kid leaves for work at 4am.  Our neighborhood isn‚Äôt friendly.  My lights are staying on.
That‚Äôs helpful. TY
I got Geeni smart bulbs. Set up alexa routines for then. My two front door sconces and my garage sconce come on at sundown. 3 bulbs each = 9 bulbs. At 11, everything shuts off except a single garage and front door bulb, and they go to 60% until sunrise when they shut off entirely. It barely lights the steps and definitely not out to my neighbors or the street. Just enough for emergency services to confirm my house number or an overnight delivery driver to not trip.

I also set up an alexa routine where if my phone arrives at home after 11pm, it temporarily turns everything back on for 10 minutes and then back to night mode after that. Works perfectly if we come home late.
Hmmmm, cornfields scare me.
Then do what makes you safe. My neighborhood is quiet, 80% have a dog and sensor lights work too.
>We do leave some outdoor lights on.

Every block has one house that is brighter than the rest. Those people should cut it out.
Bears are a different story! I have no idea, there are no bears at the shore. At least I hope not!
We have indoor motion sensors in our doorways and I love it. Walk in and the light goes on, you just need to keep the batteries changed.
Blackout shades and/or a nice light blocking sleep mask may help! I love the manta brand eye mask.
I have no history of being irritated by neighbors, but this bothers me. Our development borders a state park. We‚Äôre lucky to be so close to wildlife and yet, it looks like I live in a city. It‚Äôs unnecessary and bad for the environment. Not to mention every room in my house has a neighbors light shining in.
Yup, nothing wrong with some lights for looks and so someone doesn't bust their ass on the stairs late at night. A low, warm glow looks great on houses.

Its the folks with the cheapest LED security lights on every corner of their house that suck.
Thank you!
Sensor lights will come on when you get home also.
For sure, it throws off their migration patterns.
Agreed. It‚Äôs definitely a nuisance and terrible for wildlife.
So true. Also, I think there‚Äôs a better possibility of a day break-in because there are delivery guys, lawn services and construction people everywhere who have to just try a door knob when no one is home.
I know it‚Äôs likely for security.
Yep, I agree!
I‚Äôve come across this guy a few times. [Take a stroll under my porch.](https://imgur.com/a/RKFgLG0). I‚Äôd prefer to neither startle nor be startled by yogi.
Oh !  Those horrendous blue white flood lights are The Fucking Worst 

Mines like the equivalent of a 60 watt incandescent over the door
Are you talking about out those bright landscaping lights that McMansions use to shine onto the houses?Because those are always terribly tacky. 
  
  
My driveway is 50‚Äô long with a steep decline from the road (most non suvs would scrape). Due to this steepness, I back into my driveway, so leaving is not a chore.  The top of the roof of my house is about level with the road. What that means is that I‚Äôd need a very strong flood light to reach from the house to the driveway so I can see to back down. Also the light would need to be mounted in my roof. OR I can keep my porch lights on. I do however make sure they are amber,  not some piercing blue lights.
These are mostly 1500 square foot houses. Every plant in my neighbors yard is illuminated. ???
""piercing blue lights"". I've lived in the Poconos for the last 20 years but all my family is still in NJ, hence my route 80 video.  We had a family move in a few years ago from bergen county.  They have been slowly adding nearly blinding led lights all over the place.  I didn't realize how ridiculous they were (far right) until last summer while taking photos of the northern lights.   We live on the edge of 7000 acres of woods, not sure why they wanted to move out here and be afraid of everything outside...   
[image](https://imgur.com/a/Es9CME5)
I wouldn‚Äôt defend that silliness. But I also have cameras because event though I live in a very safe area, I‚Äôve had stupid crimes committed such as political signs being stolen. As a gay couple living on the edge of the suburbs, I have motion lights for repeated reasons and due to bears.
Bergen county is all you had to say. Are they hoping the drones would have chosen them? Haha
Motion lights where possible is considerate. When my husband spends a night away, I leave the porch light on. But day-to-day, I think of my neighbors and wildlife and the environment when I manage my lights."

It sounds stupid, but check out ones that have a school.

My wife still goes through the motions with the big holidays and the church she goes to is pretty chill and cool with folks phoning it in.

They tend to keep their flavor pretty loose around here as catholic schools have basically become feeders to the highschools, which are essentially sports academies now, and they don't want to turn anyone off.
As someone raised catholic i never got that. Like, if you have fundamental issues with your faith, and your fundamental beliefs align more closely with another one....uhhhh...maybe check out the other one?

Should we stay clear of Newton NJ?,"My husband and I are looking for a house. With the current market it‚Äôs impossible to find anything within our budget near Morris/Bergen/Essex county.

Any insight will be helpful. Thanks!

Also, Sussex County is filled with MAGA, so, if you're more liberal leaning, you may not feel comfortable there. 

That being said, off the top of my head, housing prices are more reasonable than other parts of North Jersey, with lower taxes. And, while it's not Mayberry with regard to crime, anecdotally, it's pretty safe. (I'm a woman and have never worried about driving or walking in Newton alone.)
I live in Newton and have been house hunting. The only ones that aren't outrageously overpriced all require a new septic system and most have mold problems. 

This isn't me trying to keep away the competition. What's available here is horrible.
If you're used to more conventional northern NJ bustle of the areas you listed, you might not be into it. It's not to say that it's absolutely the most stereotypical desolate thing out there or even necessarily a bad place, it's just if you have the mental imprint of shorter time windows and more convenience when thinking of say ""how long it takes to come back from the city"",""how long does it take to come back from the shore"", ""how long does it take to get to x,y,z more populated area in NJ"", ""how long does it take to go to a Costco or other shopping"" etc, you could get caught off guard with a lot of logistical things.  You're kind of a ways from stuff even when Sussex can get a lot more rural. 

Also any realtor heavily pushing the ""just an hour from the city"" is full of it.
Newton is fucking huge, so it‚Äôs gonna depend on where. I‚Äôve travelled an hour north (I live 10 minutes from downtown Newton) and been in what‚Äôs still considered Newton. Other guy is correct in stating that LEAVING Newton is fucking terrible, hence half the town working at Thor Labs. Sussex county overall is great, though. You can look around Andover/Byram/Stanhope if living a little further south and closer to highways is appealing.

Edit: My wife and I are left leaning people, and I‚Äôve never felt uncomfortable here. This isn‚Äôt rural Louisiana.
you have to go to Franklin or Wharton or Hackettstown for Taco Bell.
I've sold a bunch of stuff in Newton. Cute town; but very far depending on your commute.


Just my thoughts on waiting:¬†


Every buyer I've worked with who waited has been priced out of the market.
I live in Sussex County not at all far from Newton. Here's a comment I gave to another redditor you might find helpful. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/s/cH8ee2bRzv
Newton is a wonderful small, historic community.  It's far, but it has lots of services.  Frankly, more than I have in Journal Square, Jersey City.  It has a hospital, retail shopping, supermarkets etc.  We do not have this here.

I'd check it out.  If you think you can comfortably exist with what's there in a 25-mile radius, I'd go for it.  it's also very beautiful.
This is a fairly accurate representation. As someone who grew up in Bergen and resides in Morris I suggest looking at towns like Wharton or Roxbury, Ledgewood maybe. Takes the pricing sting off a little the farther west you go but NJ version of MAGA isn't really the same as red states I think... But I'm not sure that's a problem for you either way but Bergen county tends to be more liberal. Feel free to DM if ya need to. Life long NJ here.
It's the post office thing. I live a town over, but we have no post office. At least they did away with the rural route mail thing though. I too lean left. I think things are still not great, but it isn't the worst minus a few politicians.
I recently learned the space farms guy is a representative up yond, so I hear ya."

Chase has a way better online user experience than PNC if you want to give them a shot. I‚Äôve used both. Stay far away from Bank of America though. I swear their IT department is from another planet, not in a good way.
Are you looking for a regional bank or a national bank? I‚Äôve had TD Bank and so far it‚Äôs been pretty good to me, I used to have a checking account with Provident, but that was a disaster, especially since trying to check things online was near impossible
Chase could begin charging fees for merely having a checking account open with them.

Most do actually charge fees on checking but waive it for a certain amount of direct deposits or minimum balance.

Why do some drivers do this?,"I see this randomly, yet often enough to be curious as to why people stop this far back from the line at traffic lights. Sometimes it‚Äôs like 2 car lengths back, which to me is just weird. Sometimes if it gets me first in line of a line I‚Äôll just switch in front of them. Anybody out there who does this that can explain your reasoning? ",0.83,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jmnz7v/why_do_some_drivers_do_this/,153,1jmnz7v,2025-03-29 14:52,"I often leave a little room, usually about half a car length.  Some people take turns TIGHT and cross into the other lanes at certain intersections that I drive frequently.  Also in an area where I know to be a lot of busses or trucks turning I'll leave a little space.
I've been noticing that more and more people have trouble making left turns.  People are constantly cutting their turns too short, to the point that it feels like they're going to shear off your front bumper even if you're properly behind the stop line.  

When I remember to, I try to stop a *little* further back to compensate.  If I had actually gotten hit this way, I'd probably pick up the habit of stopping ***much*** further back.
My boyfriend‚Äôs Mom was run over by an 18 wheeler when she was younger while waiting at a red light. The truck was turning too tight and drove right on top of her car‚Ä¶..so probably a fear of something similar.
It gives traffic that makes a left hand turn more space incase said traffic cuts the turn short/tight. This is more relevant when tractor trailers, busses, and other large vehicles are making the turn.


Alternatively, and very unlikely, they might want a rolling start when the light is turning green.


Either way, you switching lanes to get in front of them in this scenario is what we average people call ""a dick move.""
If you're in an area like me with a lot of tractor trailers traffic they make wide turns and if you are too close your going to have to backup for them anyway
Too many times I‚Äôve seen drivers cross into that lane when turning‚Äîand it‚Äôs a serious issue when you‚Äôre waiting and there‚Äôs a large vehicle in the lane to your right obstructing the view of that turning traffic. I‚Äôve nearly been hit several times because, well, Jersey drivers. But, it‚Äôs also a balancing act because some lanes have sensors that, if you‚Äôre too far back, won‚Äôt be triggered and you won‚Äôt get your own left turn signal.
 Because people turning left cut corners all the time. People can‚Äôt drive to save their lives.
I do this in places I know are tight so Trucks or busses can turn easily or so distracted don't hit me while they're turning. I've had several occasions where turning drivers almost hit me head on while I was stopped like that.
I don‚Äôt want to be hit by morons making left turns crossing into that area.
To give trucks/buses room to turn
They can‚Äôt see the light?
I do it because I got hit once by a truck turning left into the opposite direction.
So trucks could make the turn
Summary of all these comments, bc of bad drivers.
Trucks making left turns
The angle of my windshield makes it impossible to see the light if I pull up too close
I‚Äôll do it if I see a semi truck attempting to make a left. Sometimes they need extra space to make the turn and I don‚Äôt wanna get clipped
Could be peeping the opposing/crossing traffic‚Äôs light. In Wilmington De if you‚Äôre at the line you can‚Äôt see when it‚Äôs changing. A little further back you can see it. In some merging situations you have to be super alert cause if ya get caught daydreaming 8 cars will cut over in front of you driving like it‚Äôs 9:30am on a Sunday.
Not as far back as 1 or 2 carlengths, but I might leave some extra room for left-turners coming from the right. Depends on how wide the intersection is.

ETA: Or for right-turning buses or trucks coming from the left!
I have yet to see a comment mentioning some people just don‚Äôt like their windows lined up with another car. They don‚Äôt like being seen lol
They're in the wrong lane and they're going to nose their way into your lane by doing this.
PTSD from Buses and trucks that can‚Äôt make sharp turns.
I am too tall that the roof of many cars and trucks blocked the traffic light so I have to stop earlier so I could see the light without bending down
You ever seen an 18wheeler make a turn? Have you ever seen an 18wheeler scrape the front of your 1983 Toyota Tercel that you worked to buy when you turned 17? That‚Äôs why you should stay back a little bit. I had that car for 2 weeks! I‚Äôm still salty about it 30 years later!
I stop a little farther back since one of my friends was rear ended and sent into oncoming traffic. My mom was also stopped at a light when an accident occured in the intersection and one of the cars spun out and hit her car hard enough to total it.

I also live in a city with old, narrow streets and a lot of bus traffic that cannot make turns in the average intersection, so I leave a little space for them otherwise they start and then we are all stuck until everyone behind the first car backs up.
This is why https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dnD4e28TseQ
In addition to the bad left turns. I‚Äôve seen multiple times buses need the extra space when turning.
Busses and trucks. End of story. Lol
Tight turners and big trucks.¬†
I moved from PA to NJ and people in NJ complain that Pennsylvanians get right up and sometimes over the line, but then people in NJ do this unnecessary crap lol. It's funny seeing driving habits from both sides
So I do this a lot in the smaller towns especially. Tractor trailers sometimes need the extra space and also some people make SHAAAARP left turns. When I was in driving school getting my lessons, a car in front of me got hit by a Tacoma making a sharp left.
I understand people not wanting to get hit by someone making a left, but often I see people so far back they don‚Äôt trip the left hand turn signal. And most of the time these intersections already have the line painted further back to accommodate lefts. BUT they also have that lined up with the left turn arrow. So if you‚Äôre not near the line, you never get the arrow.
To prevent getting swiped by an oncoming left turner. I noticed in some towns, they've started moving the line back.
If an 18 wheeler turns from your right side down that road the left lane will have to back upm
If your car is rear ended you won't end up in the middle of the intersection. Same reason why you should leave space in front of you when stopped in traffic.
They just want to look at you without you being able to look at them.
He's driving defensively. In addition to other reasons explained here, I've watched too many intersection freak accident videos so I like to give myself some room. 
Let me ask you something, why do you cut in front if  there's space in a similar situation?
We‚Äôll see the thing is Jersey drivers are shit so this is for their owners own protection - they have probably been clipped before
I never not do this, seen to many trucks barely not hit a car
All the semi trucks or buses cut straight across the left turn lane..

..cars are usually having to go in reverse to give room.
So some cars make their left turns really tight.  Often times busses and trucks also need that room to pass by.  The markings on the floor are like a straight 90 degree angle corner instead of a curve, so it's safer for me, easier for anybody making a curve, and a better overall choice for everyone in the situation
Because people dont know how to turn left. So many people cut their turns, what should be a fairly hard 90 degreeish maneuver becomes a long gentle sweeping motiom that usually cuts into at least one lane of oncoming traffic. They are sitting back because they think they need the extra space to initiate their turn as a result.
I do this. It‚Äôs because I want to leave clearance for turning 18-wheelers.
1) they don‚Äôt want their car hit by anyone making a left turn

2) get off your phone while operating a car
I guess you‚Äôve never had to back up down a highway to give an 18 wheeler room to turn before. Must be nice.
I work in Secaucus and people tend to do the opposite. They pull all the way up and busses and trailers can‚Äôt make a right which is incredibly aggravating
Because semi trucks are a thing and they need extra room to make left turns.  I can't count the number of times I've seen a truck driver take a turn a little too sharp and watched the wheels of their trailer barely clear the nose of my car.
Because you don't need to be at the stop line. if you can't see it, you're too close to the intersection and/or a crosswalk.
There‚Äôs a turn near my house that when I get to it I stop maybe 25 feet back because everyone making the left which crosses my line cuts into the lane. All it takes is one idiot to just yolo into my lane to cause a head on collision when I am fully stopped.
It's better than the jackoffs who stop car lengths ahead of the stop line so you have to swing super wide around them when you're turning left into their street
The proper way to wait in a left turn lane? I don't know. So that poor turners and large left turning trucks can get where they want to go without hitting you?
My wife does that - I honestly don't know why
Trucks or busses .
I do this because I was rear ended once and pushed into oncoming traffic. So I leave a little room just incase now. It pisses off a lot of people but oh well. 
When I was driving the hearse a couple years prior to my accident, my boss told me to do this because buses in the city take turns way too wide.
Sometimes I do that just so a person turning right can see oncoming traffic better. Especially on busy parts of Route 23
We're the jug handle state. Left turns aren't our specialty
Is that 9 and 571? I‚Äôd hang back there just bc there‚Äôs an accident like three times a week.
The car in the furthest left lane should always be further back if the stop line doesn‚Äôt allow space for 53‚Äô trucks to turn right. Some intersections specifically put the line further back for this reason.
There are a few intersections, one being in my town of Oakland, where I'm in the left lane, and other drivers making a left turn from a perpendicular road cut too close. One either stops short waiting at the light or risk getting nailed at the intersection.
Bc we‚Äôre in Jersey and people suck at driving. I don‚Äôt want my car to be swiped by the person turning.
Everyone is in a freakin rush.  Leave more space, let the other driver go first, don't be so fast to hit the horn when the light turns green, let the other driver move over if they are signaling, slow down, and stay off your phone even at red lights. 0h, and if you are a pedestrian or biker make sure you can be seen and have light clothes or good reflectors at night. Whew. Thanks for letting me vent.
I‚Äôm making taking this turn no matter what!
Was driving a commercial truck once and was taking it down a hill. My brakes locked up and I had no brakes. Was coming up behind this pick up that left a little bit of space like this, and because he left that little space it saved not only him, but countless other cars in that intersection.
If I do it, it's because I don't want you watching me eat an entire  steak burrito in the time span of one stoplight.

That's why. 

To protect your innocence
Make that U-turn and go to Jim Johnstons - great place
I do this for the reasons stated above plus leaving room for maneuverability in case of emergency vehicles needing to get through. I don't know who needs help or why, but I'm not going to be the reason there wasn't space to get by.
The National Safety Council suggests stopping like this so that if you get hit from behind you aren't pushed into the intersection
u haven‚Äôt been on the road long enough to know why, that‚Äôs why
East Hanover/Roseland?
Where is that, over on Newman Springs Road? Where it meets Swimming River road?
is this 23?
because people turning onto the road you're on cut that corner too closely and might hit you (especially bigger vehicles like buses and rigs)
I do it if I see a truck coming or if the intersection seems very tight. Sometimes it's hard for trucks to take the corner.
You just scan aria and if a big track somewhere going to turn, you leave him a space. Lots of tracks going through New Jersey. And to be honest, most of the cars in new jersey a big SUV‚Äôs. So it‚Äôs just a habit.
Because some donkeys making that left turn there can get real close, so gotta help them out a bit for everyone‚Äôs sake. Also big trucks or busses can get too close.
It‚Äôs so they don‚Äôt get hit¬†
Eatontown gonna eat I guess. People are absolutely nuts. They don‚Äôt get it.
There could always be a big rig come to make a turn.
He sees the truck on the left and is giving him ample room?
PTSD from getting clipped or almost clipped by a truck lol
Let's see, because of 18 wheelers and bad driver soccer mom's in Tahoes
I was a few cars behind someone one that left about double the amount of room you have in that picture. They were so far the protected left sensor didn't trigger and we missed a light cycle. Some people shouldn't be driving.
I see more of the opposite where people think you‚Äôre supposed to stop directly under the light giving no room for people turning from opposite direction.
I stay back a little bit (not that far) for a couple reasons. On Rutgers campus it‚Äôs to give the busses space to do their turns, anywhere else it‚Äôs bc people really really like to do their left turn into my lane (double left turn lanes) and I really don‚Äôt want to get in an accident. Too many idiots
for trucks turning left
Are they expecting a big tractor trailer to turn from the intersecting road?
Is this the intersection of Taylors Mills and Route 9?
Doesn‚Äôt this make smart traffic lights don‚Äôt turn green for left turns?
Is this red bank lol
i sympathize w/being worries about being clipped, but if there is a left turn signal, it is likely activated by a sensor in the asphalt that is weight sensitive. if you find yourself waiting at the light forever and people behind you getting furious, you only have yourself to blame
In addition to the comments about bad drivers, it‚Äôs possible that they‚Äôre trying to trip the sensor for a left-turn arrow. In my town at least, the left-turn lane only gets an arrow if there are multiple cars waiting to turn‚Äîbut that‚Äôs because the sensor is a car length behind the line. So if someone stops far enough back, they can get the arrow even if they‚Äôre the only one there.
It's certainly better than the drivers that go over the line by 4 ft.
I do it a lot bc sometimes cars that are entering the road make fast and sharp turns. Once you see it happen, you dont want it to happen to you
Trucks and busses
Changebridge Rd would like a word with you
I stop when the line disappears from my view behind the hood. Some people may follow this process and just be shorter.
My dad was hut by someone who turned into his lane. He was pulled up but behind the line. I do not know why the oncoming driving made such a wide turn, but he slammed right into my dad.

I've also seen trailors and busses make turns, carefully, and they sometimes need to space. Maybe some people are being careful or have had an experience
another reason is that maybe they can't see the traffic light if they pull all the way up
I think the comment was directed to people who do this always, not if there is a truck there.  If you are in a left turn only lane and do this, the light will not change if it set by sensors.  It's stupid and just shows that people don't pay attention.

AND people do this when they aren't even the first car.  Again, lot of dumb drivers out there.
If you don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs concerning.
The line is there for a reason. Pull up to it. There is plenty of room for vehicles to get by.
they‚Äôre scared of the right side left turns, they don‚Äôt want it to cut close to their car. they‚Äôre prob old.
Tennessee checking in, I refer to that as ""cellphone clearance"". It's the same reason the chuckleheads around here drive DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAMNED ROAD.
It's so they don't accidentally trip the sensor that makes their light turn green./s
Poor depth perception.
Is there a red light camera there? Or an old non operating one?
Because most of them have given all their attention to their phones. Once they glanced up and saw there was no car in their way, they just go back on facebook and just stop wherever.
I think they do it to piss off the people behind them
They think you're cute and are nervous to look at you.
Cause they‚Äôre idiots
Because people are dumb. Especially in cedar knolls.
This is the answer. This picture is a bit extreme, but people get clipped all the time, especially in tighter intersections, and especially by trucks or trailers.
i'm on a side street off Bloomfield Ave but people use it to whip through and avoid lights...a lot of people take the left turn into my street and cut way into the opposing side, especially during football season because there's a couple bars and there will definitely be a bunch of drunk ass drivers pulling out after a Giants / Jets loss and going back to their Soprano houses
I never see people do ""little room"" always at least 50 feet üòÅ
I do this because sometimes trucks need a little more space to make a turn. It doesn't really hurt anyone.
Based on every car that turns in front me coming into that turning lane, that car is too far up for my comfort.
Exactly. I do this because I value my life
Especially at Mt Moriah turning north to 240.
This. What you said. Almost got clipped a few times because of other drivers so I'm more aware of spacing because of that.
This !
People look up from their phones juuuuust enough to drive usually
Yeah, people have terrible spacial awareness, especially in cars. I know I‚Äôm not perfect about it either.

There are also a few intersections where the lane cars are turning into is just way too narrow and has terrible visibility from the turning point. People unfamiliar with the area will nearly clip the other car every time. I‚Äôve seen a few places where the line had to be repainted to be set back by about the same amount show  above for this very reason.

Edit: Corrected typo from ""special awareness"" to ""spacial awarenss"" because some dude came and found me in a totally different dead thread to point it out. lol
Same here - I‚Äôve noticed it a lot more in the last few years. I‚Äôll always leave around a car length ahead of me for that reason.¬†

Guess the only person I‚Äôm harming by doing that is OP, lol.¬†
Where I grew up, many stop lights had scales underneath that would change the light when someone approached the light. When you're this far back, you'll never get the turning light. Turning left on Degraw Ave in Teaneck is a great example.
Right? I know a few places where my bumper has nearly been swiped every time. I‚Äôm always going to sit a bit further back than the line in those places. I‚Äôm not putting myself in the line of fire just so the jerk behind me can get across the intersection 2 seconds quicker.
Yeah, that makes sense‚Ä¶ and true, a dick move. In my defense, though, I‚Äôve only done that a few times in instances where the person is back a ridiculous amount (like 2-3 car lengths).
This is the reason I do it. Although, not usually 2 car lengths.
Unclear who the bad drivers are:

1. OP, for calling out something that might actually be good practice
2. The driver stopped way behind the line, taking up valuable space that those behind him can use
3. Vehicles making a left turn who risk clipping the car if it was at the line
4. Everyone on the road except me
yea, I know of a few lights in Atlantic County where you cannot see the light if you pull up to the line. The right turn onto Tilton Road from 322/40 in front of the old shore mall is one. They have a grill in front of the light so drivers going straight do not see it turn green, but if you are first in line going right, you cannot see it either.
same lol
I think this is the crux.  Seeing ahead for the eventuality of that truck - or a truck or bus from the right needing a little fudge room to make their life easier- and keep your car from a close shave
Yes but I know for a fact 95% don‚Äôt think like that
This particular intersection does look wide enough, but perhaps the driver is in the habit for the reason dozens of others have stated here.
I've been nearly clipped by people in cars, and not like just nearly scrapped. People will cut their turns so tight they're half way over the double line.
And they even do it when they‚Äôre 3+ cars deep at a light. I never understood that - some room makes sense, but 10 feet??? Confuses the hell out of me
This is the truth, Ruth! Cutting over the lines to save .0000000000000000001 seconds, and driving while scrolling a feed.
This might be extreme but if someone is caught using the phone even once, they should have their license suspended for a significant amount of time or it should be revoked. It might be one of the only ways to stop them
Inductive loop sensors. Not a scale exactly. Closer to a circuit. Same idea though: if you‚Äôre too far back, it won‚Äôt detect the metal object.
Spot on.
Sad part is, as ridiculously wide as the street in this photo is, if someone is making a tight turn then they shouldn't be driving.
Look at the big brains on Brad

edit: lol uncultured swine https://youtu.be/Hrm-rPSCIBw?si=h0polqtGc_tysb69
NJ should really do yearly culling of bad drivers. The amount of shit I see just driving around town is maddening
It's happened to me with intersections that look just like that. At times they aren't even trying to beat the light either
Uh‚Ä¶because of the metric system‚Ä¶
yes. Driving is a privilege and not a right
Karma moment. My husband was hit by someone and despite the dash cam and rear cam  footage showed her pulling three illegal moves before she hit my husband, she still thought she wasn't wrong and continued to yell and scream at my husband and the cop who showed up to take the report. 

It was very gratifying when he found out she was given tickets for those illegal moves and she had to pay for repairing the damage on his car.
I absolutely agree‚Ä¶. 

So please make walking and biking safe. 

They way things are set in our state you kinda NEED to drive.
10000% they need to focus on making this state more walkable than it currently is. I feel like they could seriously do it if they listened to the urban planners that focus on developing models which emphasize walking/biking and community at large. It could also increase housing inventory in this state.

Part of why people like Christmas decor so much is because it often depicts these really beautiful cities that aren‚Äôt just cinderblock monstrosities that make you want to stay inside.

PSA. Don't use debit cards at all. Fraud on debit cards are worse for you than credit cards.


And if you do use a debit card, do it at your own bank's ATM. Use a big bank if you travel alot and need options everywhere. Use a local bank if you have one that's super convenient. Take enough cash to keep you afloat for a few days without needing to us an atm somewhere else.¬†¬†
Go right to a bank branch that issued the card. They will issue you a new card personally and delete the old one.
Best to use an ATM located inside the bank during operating hours if you can help it. My bank you don‚Äôt even need to insert your card can just scan your phone! 

Some of these skimmers are now able to read cards without being inserted or so I‚Äôve heard. It‚Äôs wild out here.
Why would you ever use a convenience store ATM?
 
Those 3rd party ATM companies are shady as hell to start with, maybe just a small step up from check cashing places.    The convenience store has no skin in the game so are not going to be looking for skimmers and tampering.
I stopped using my debit card for purchases years ago. I was victimized twice online. I only use virtual credit card numbers online and credit cards for purchases at physical stores. Use tap pay or chip readers. Never swipe. If they offer Apple Pay or other way to pay with your phone that's even more secure. Don't go to stores that don't have these options.
Debit card fraud - your money
Credit card fraud - bank's money
You should call the police.  The ATM probably has a ""reader"" strip on it being used to capture card information.
[deleted]
huh.. weren't chip on cards supposed to solve this?
Ya all already done
It‚Äôs all already taken care of
Anyone that uses a ATM machine or uses their debit card  should get into the habit of taking the card reader and giving it a good tug. 

If anything comes off call the cops and alert whoever is in charge of it.
Ya I know. I never use debit card except to take out cash at ATMs, guess I gotta switch up my movements
Bellmawr. Opposite side of the state.

The chip isn‚Äôt helpful in protecting against purchases where the numbers can be keyed in, such as online.

NJ school principals fear Trump bid to end Education Department,"Steven Fulop‚Äôs response he posted on Facebook: 

There are actionable steps that NJ leadership should be taking around education beyond press releases to protect our schools. 

1) We should be pushing to amend the state constitution to better protect public education policy in NJ. There isn‚Äôt much in there now. There is a clear lesson here that absent a federal DOE there is too much flexibility at the state for a Republican governor and the rules are not codified to protect our children on state structure or DOE. We need to protect 

2) State surplus under Murphy has grown from $500m in 2017 to $6.1B today. This is a good thing but he should be clear he will draw it down some to offset the $1.2b at risk from the federal govt for special needs 

3) Murphy should demonstrate the contrast with how we view education at the federal level by finally resolving the school segregation lawsuits and challenges in NJ

Actions are more important than words.",0.92,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jmllsf/nj_school_principals_fear_trump_bid_to_end/,35,1jmllsf,2025-03-29 12:52,"Isn‚Äôt a large portion of that 6.2 billion surplus debt based.  What happened to the debt created without public bonding wasn‚Äôt that 6 billion.
It just puts the burden on the state‚Äôs DOE, which will probably increase property taxes to generate lost federal fund
Please just say you work for fulop
Okay, hold the damn phone, now!  The whole point of dismantling the DOE, was to give the control back to the states, wasn't it?.  So now Traitor Trump wants to stick his disgusting face into how NJ chooses to run things?  Hey, Puppet President, butt the hell out!
Linda has more bones in her closet than plastic in her face. She and her husband are shitty gangsters who treat their talented wrestlers like trash. They are sexually perverted deviant rapists who couldn't care less about anyone they deem below them which is a majority of the population. Fuck her and fuck her piece of shit husband. Father Time is undefeated, and I can't wait for him to nab this crop of fuck faces. There is no way that she should hold a high government position.
We are spending more than we are taking in. Pretty simple. Very little math involved.
I don‚Äôt trust Trump at all. But even without the dept of education he claimed he will send the money directly to the states. If so that‚Äôs the best outcome for a state like NJ.  The 504 is a federal thing and a law even if the doe isn‚Äôt here it has to be somehow enforced‚Ä¶ IEPs are state.  

Just so everyone is clear.   Either way Murphy won‚Äôt do shit neither will whoever this fool is. Most NJ politicians are more corrupt than the ones federally. I have next to no hope for it.
Surplus??? NJ is in debt and this budget calls for spending more than we bring in. Numbers are political
You're not wrong except that isn't sustainable and public districts will collapse.

Which is exactly what they want so that education can be privatized and commodified. And when that happens every retired educator who depends on a functioning pension system will face poverty.

With all these cuts, states (Especially blue states) Should be paying far less in federal taxes. Blue states already disproptiinately support the nation. This will only make that gap even bigger... Until it collapses.
All the more reason for Murphy to use some of the surplus we currently have first.
Why is enthusiasm for Fulop so hard to believe? I‚Äôm just working to get a good candidate elected. The lack of enthusiasm for the other candidates is pretty obv. Except for Baraka, who is also bringing good ideas to the campaign.
I don‚Äôt. Not even as a volunteer. 
It‚Äôs ok to research and have an opinion. 
Free country, unless EO has taken that away too. 

He is the best candidate in this race is my strong belief.
Rich kid whose daddy was an Israeli sniper and worked at Goldman sachs... I've seen this movie before. 1000s just like him but I'm sure THIS one is different and has the everyman at heart....sigh. I'm so tired.
IEPs are federal law. It‚Äôs part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
Wait. You don‚Äôt trust trump at all but you
Believe a single word he says about money?
How so? By which mechanism? Which agency will take over the distribution and oversight of the funds? Trump says a lot of shit, very little of it becomes true.
>  The 504 is a federal thing and a law even if the doe isn‚Äôt here it has to be somehow enforced

Who do you think will do that? NJ will ultimately be fine. But kids in shithole (Read: republican run) states are *fucked*.
Budget surplus means we are taking in more than we are spending.  Let's say you owe a million dollars.  You make 100,000 per year and spend 75,000 per year.  This means you have a surplus of $25,000.  The fact that you owe a million dollars does not magically make the $25,000 surplus disappear.
New York recently introduced a bill to reduce funding sent to the federal government proportional to what the feds owe the state in promised funding for stuff like education. NJ should follow their lead
I‚Äôm a volunteer for one of his Assembly slates, he got the Good Government Coalition of NJ endorsement.
Theyre enforced by the DOE. No DOE, no enforcement
Yes sorry, however as a parent who deals with this daily with the school system.  Idk who the fuck even enforced it now other than parents.  Do you understand how difficult it is to get your kid on an IEP and at no point is there any real help at the federal level? You just need to endlessly bully the schools and get lawyers involved.. and it‚Äôs usually decided at a local level.  Rarely does it go higher.  And the acts haven‚Äôt been removed they‚Äôre still there.   We don‚Äôt need the doe to enforce them as they rarely do.  NJ won‚Äôt suddenly not enforce it as the local schools control this anyway.

Again idk what happens I don‚Äôt like Trump but dealing with NJ now with the DOE federally around (pre Trump) they didn‚Äôt do shit for me and my family.  Endless meetings, lawyer letters, 10k doctors bills.. to get an IEP and endless meetings of them trying to remove it and we‚Äôre in a top 20 school district in NJ. 

That‚Äôs the reality for all of us parents.
Read comprehension isn‚Äôt your strong suit.   I said I don‚Äôt trust him but this is what he said.  And if it‚Äôs true it‚Äôs the best outcome for NJ.  If it‚Äôs not true then whatever we will self fund our schools most of NJ already does.  It‚Äôs not a lot of money we get for our school systems in this state.
So anyway, spoke to a the head special education for a particular county literally just now.

She said she‚Äôs not even worried because NJ laws far exceed whatever the federal government does and  NJ will be fine.  In fact the head of the DOE just sent out a memo specifically stating that.  

So again this doesn‚Äôt hurt NJ.  This will hurt Alabama and Florida.   And i feel bad for those kids but not ours.
Exactly this. We‚Äôre one of the largest contributors of federal money. This should be decreased and used to fund education and infrastructure
How exactly does that work, tax collection is done federally, the states don't collect and then pass it on to the federal government.
College Dems too
The commenter above said they are ‚Äústate‚Äù.  Maybe you meant to reply to them?
Would probably be moved to HHS for enforcement.
I‚Äôm sorry for your experience, but I‚Äôve had the exact opposite happen. Getting my son an IEP was a breeze, and we really only had one disagreement with our local school, which was quickly arbitrated in our favor. Everything, including arranging the arbitration, was handled by our school system with great efficiency.
And healthcare. Negotiate pricing with a health insurance company on behalf of all 9.6+ million residents. No co-pays, no deductibles, and full health/dental/vision insurance coverage.
I saw that too. And completely forgot about it for some reason.
Yeah but also that‚Äôs local laws.  The fed doesn‚Äôt involve themselves in it.
He also has many others notably electeds outside the political machine.

Should I go to Caldwell University?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently living in Southwestern part of the country. 

I want to major in Nursing and I got into Caldwell University with $34k scholarship/year and their honors program. This would bring my cost of attendance down to around $24k/year. I unfortunately haven't got a chance to go there and visit the campus myself so I have no idea how the campus would feel in person.

My another option is just go to a community college for nursing and then transfer to a 4-year college later.

Do you think I should go to Caldwell? I would appreciate if you can share more about the school.

Thank you so much!",0.53,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jmgu1x/should_i_go_to_caldwell_university/,34,1jmgu1x,2025-03-29 07:12,"So even with a scholarship, you‚Äôll graduate with $100k in student loans, before interest. For a school you haven‚Äôt seen in person. That does not sound like a good deal. Go to community college. Then transfer somewhere that you‚Äôre confident is worth your money and time.
Community College and transfer to an in state public college. 
Be as debt free as you possibly can.
I'm an NP, I did my undergrad at fairly decent University and I accumulated lots of student loans, if I was to advise you, I would tell you to complete it with the least cost.. although it's not easy to find a cheap 4-year school, some people would start by getting their associate and then going back, this is another option. But if taking student loans or someone is helping you with the tuition, then it's best to go straight to do your BSN.
If you want a smaller campus, it should definitely be on the radar.  

A plus is that it is relatively close to NYC, tucked away in an upscale suburban neighborhood.

It will also give you a taste of east coast living.

Good luck!
My daughter went there, not for nursing. She had a great experience. Small campus, decent downtown. She said her biggest complaint was the food. They always put out a really nice spread when visitors are there, but the day to day can get mundane.
I can‚Äôt stress enough tO young nursing students to do yourself a favor and go the least expensive route you can so you‚Äôre not paying student loans the the rest of your life If you want your BSN right away at least get your prerequisites done at a local community college then transfer to a 4 year university Id even suggest getting your ADN getting a job and taking the tuition assistance most hospitals offer after hire to finish your BSN 
No employer cares where you get your degree as long as it‚Äôs accredited and you pass your NCLEX
Omg it‚Äôs over 50k to go there? No, that‚Äôs Ivy League expensive. For a nursing degree go to a state school that‚Äôs cheaper . Don‚Äôt be saddled with debt unless your parents are paying then go for it.
Wes Cawell Wes Cawell
Community college, save some money, get as close to done degree wise as possible, then if you must, transfer. You are going into a high demand field and w the aging population demand will continue to increase
No, go somewhere that matters and will help start u off on the right foot after all the debt
I didn‚Äôt get my undergrad degree there, but I did go there for 2 graduate degrees. It‚Äôs a really nice campus. It‚Äôs very small but it isn‚Äôt too far from shopping and restaurants. The town is very quiet, but it is near larger towns with bigger college scenes (Montclair, Wayne, etc). It is a really tough area for finding affordable non-campus housing, so keep that in mind if you think dorm life will be hard for you.
As someone who most of my friends are nurses and we all work in healthcare go to community college. Dont go into debt for an average school. Nurses are very in demand you will land a job just as good from community college with way less debt. Your future self will thank you for this trust me!
Out of state - private education. Im 36 and still paying student loans because of this
Do a virtual tour or I‚Äôm sure someone on YouTube filmed the campus. It‚Äôs close to NYC with buses and trains nearby into city and surrounding towns are nice and have nice downtown areas.  I would seriously consider it. Good luck!
Ask nursing page...I'm not a nurse but I'm gonna guess many employers/hospitals probably don't care much which nursing school you graduate from. Unless it's something for profit shit school...that's my guess
Unless you‚Äôre really desperate I wouldn‚Äôt. For that price you can go to any other reputable school. Especially if you don‚Äôt plan on being a nurse in NJ afterwards I can‚Äôt think of any reason to go there and spend all that money for a school that many haven‚Äôt heard of .
Smaller campus in a suburban NJ area, big house on the hills nearby. I think there is a campus ministry and masses as well, that‚Äôs the vibe I get. But seems relaxed and still close enough to NYC and there should be public transit available to get you there.
Go to community college, get an Associates degree, pass the NCLEX, get a job in a hospital and take advantage of tuition reimbursement for your BSN. Earn while you learn! Hospitals do not care where you went to school. The important thing is the license.
i go to caldwell and it is a great school for the most part however it is incredibly small and not much social life here but the program is pretty good as long as youre able to teach yourself and know what to focus on! im also a nursing major here
Caldwell University alumni here, you'll get a good education there. The class sizes were small, and the staff when I went were very helpful, and I made lifelong friends living in the dorms. It has its quirks but it was a good experience. Caldwell is in a great spot in NJ too. Close to the city and not far from the beach when it gets warm.
I would suggest going to a community college and trying for a better school given these options. While I don‚Äôt agree with this system, employers care what school you went to. Caldwell college will leave you destitute with no career prospects
Alternatively, if youre signing up for 100k debt, spend the $500 for flight and 1 nights stay to have an idea of what youre signing up for
This 100%
Thanks!
Please don't neglect the fact that some of the best places to eat in the country are just an Uber ride away. The food options in the Caldwell/Verona/Montclair area are out of this world. Obviously NYC is fairly close
My daughter also went there. Wound up getting a degree and now teaches.  I don‚Äôt know if she wants to get her masters or not, but she has a good job teaching. Had to move out state though. Nowadays you may needs a masters to get more money. 

Caldwell is not too expensive - Awhile back when I was looking at schools with my daughter. I think it‚Äôs on par price wise with Kean; FDU; and CNJ, but cheaper than Drew and Seton Hall - where I went. IIRC. I don‚Äôt know the prices now,
Beat me to it
I have a friend that works in the nicu at a major hospital system. She says it doesn‚Äôt matter what college you graduate from. As long as you have a degree. Nursing is so short staffed that they really don‚Äôt care.
If she‚Äôs going for nursing, she will absolutely be able to get a job.
Absolute bs!  Nurses are in extremely high demand due to a loss of nurses since covid. Don't spew things that are incorrect
I agree.  But it can get pricey for a college student.
I'll add on that you can jump on the Bloomfield Ave bus and travel through all those towns for cheaper than an Uber. West Caldwell also has a lot of places to eat.

"Why does it seem like you have to pay toll on every exit you take (gas, Wawa to use the bathroom, etc.)?","Went to an event and I had to get gas while on I-95. Took the exit and had to pay $4.70 to get back on I-95 after getting gas and peeing. Makes me reconsider moving to NJ, and looking at places in PA (Lancaster, Bucks or Philadelphia areas).

If you exit, you pay toll.   If you go to a rest area with restaurants/bathroom/gas, there's no toll but everything is more expensive.
I mean..just don't use the toll roads..and wait till you find out about the pa turnpike..talk about pricey
I-95, as in the NJ Turnpike I-95?

Because that's how the Turnpike works????

Get on, go through toll, get ticket or EZ Pass is read, take exit, show ticket, pay based on where the ticket says you got on/EZ Pass does it automatically. 

It's literally how the Turnpike works. You pay as you exit based on where you entered, and there's no toll booths on the road itself. If you exit halfway through your trip then enter back on, you'll pay two smaller tolls instead of one larger one. It's also why there are rest stops ON the turnpike so you don't have to exit for gas/bathroom/etc.

This isn't poor design. It's actually GREAT design because you pay once for the entire time you're on the road and don't slow down for tolls in between.This is you being clueless how the Turnpike works.
If you were on the Turnpike, there are rest areas on the highway specifically so you don't have to get off. I can't think of a toll-on/toll-off highway that doesn't have rest areas.
Because the Parkway (and Turnpike and AC Expressway) are entirely funded by user fees, not taxes.
Let‚Äôs say the toll for traveling from A-C is $10 and the two smaller segments of A-B (exit, reenter) B-C are $5 each. You pay the same total. 


NJTP sees where you enter and sets the exit toll for that leg traveled, instead of having fixed fee tolls periodically on the road.
I have never gotten off The Turnpike for gas or food. The Turnpike is 117 miles, so even if you're travelling the whole length you're good if you gas up before. 

The rest stops are more expensive, but bathrooms are free if you need to go. 

>Makes me reconsider moving to NJ, and looking at places in PA (Lancaster, Bucks or Philadelphia areas).

The PA Turnpike is even worse. The tolls are more expensive per mile and the rest stops are not as nice.
I‚Äôd be more concerned with the property taxes/rent/congestion than tolls, they‚Äôre not bad but once you know the lay of the land
'Experience' is that thing you needed 5 minutes ago.  Now you're wiser.
The PA Turnpike I'm pretty sure is THE most expensive toll road in the country for no reason I can ascertain. There was an infographic someone made a while back that I don't have handy, but when I saw the price to travel its entire length my jaw dropped.
I came here to say this. Thanks for explaining it to the uninformed. You only pay for what you use.
Yeah I don‚Äôt think you pay anything extra for getting on and off. Pretty sure it‚Äôs just one set toll for the full length of the turnpike and you pay a fraction of that based on how many segments of it you drive
I looked it up, and was surprised to learn they don't receive any money from the State at all. But 3% of their revenue comes from the US Treasury.
I calculated after I got gas but I could have made it to Philadelphia lines to reach my aunt‚Äôs home without having to pay that extra toll. I paid 3 tolls (one will be getting mailed to me since they flashed my plate). It‚Äôs like it costs a lot of money to have fun nowadays.
I did a round trip of 150 miles before needing gas. My tank was 80% full.
I went 1 fucking exit a year or 2 back and it was some ridiculous amount..10 or 12 dollars ..
The toll on the Turnpike depends on how far you drove. You didn‚Äôt pay to exit, you paid for the distance you drove.

Driving the whole length of a turnpike (exit 18 to 1)  in a passenger car, peak rates with EZPass costs $21.24.

But if you exit at 8A in the middle you pay $13.87 for 18 to 8A and another $8.35 from 8A to which is $22.22 total. So you‚Äôve paid 98¬¢ extra for exiting and entering, but your $13.87 toll on this example (or $4.70 in your real experience) was for the miles you drove before the exit - not for the exit itself.
My friends over in Harrisburg are lucky I love them and their cats as much as I do, elsewise I'd never see them lmao
The exit then going back to the turnpike
Shiiiit i feel that üòÇ
Right, I covered that in the example.
Well I don‚Äôt take the turnpike so idk how any of that works. This was my first time. I googled it and it stated rest stop doesn‚Äôt charge when going back onto the turnpike only when taking an exit
If you go to one of the highway rest stops, you wouldn‚Äôt have gone through any toll.

Regardless, the point remains that you would‚Äôve been charged a very similar amount whether you got off the highway midway or not. By getting off, you just paid it in two medium charges instead of one bigger charge, but the total would‚Äôve been about the same.
The toll booth isn‚Äôt charging you, per se. It‚Äôs tracking your entry and exit point so the system knows how much to charge you total for the trip. The reason there‚Äôs no toll booth at the rest area is because you‚Äôre not leaving the system when you go there. There‚Äôs no exit to the outside world from the rest area, only back onto the turnpike"
"Neighbor‚Äôs Wood Stove Pumps Thick, Noxious Smoke ‚Äì Need Advice","Hey everyone,
I am a single female and need advice on dealing with a neighbor‚Äôs wood stove that has been making my life miserable for the past two years. This isn‚Äôt normal wood stove burning. The smoke is thick, white, and has a noxious smell‚Äîsometimes like a campfire, other times like chemicals. It‚Äôs excessive and relentless, seeping into my home, clinging to my clothes, hair, and even my dog. The burning happens six months out of the year, sometimes even in the summer, and gets especially bad at night.

I have over 500 videos and photos documenting this. The smoke is so thick that I wake up in a panic because it fills my house. It‚Äôs gotten so bad that I can‚Äôt enjoy my property for months at a time.

I reported this to code enforcement, and they were cited for a public health and nuisance violation. They pled guilty, but only received a small fine. The township can‚Äôt force them to stop, only fine them if violations continue. Despite this, they keep burning as if nothing happened.

The most frustrating part? It seems intentional. The burning often correlates with me getting home from work, and they start shortly after I arrive. The smoke gets especially bad at night, making it impossible to enjoy my property. I can‚Äôt even open my windows or step outside without feeling overwhelmed.
I‚Äôve reached out to code enforcement again to file another complaint, but this is taking a serious toll on my mental health. I‚Äôve suffered panic attacks, and the stress of dealing with this for years is wearing me down.

I spoke with them on the phone twice:
1. The first time, they actually admitted to doing it out of spite. They apologized and said they would ‚Äúmake it so I don‚Äôt have to reach out again‚Äù and that I ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt notice the smoke anymore.‚Äù That never happened.
2. The second time, they just talked in circles and nothing was resolved.

I‚Äôve already reached out to code enforcement again to file another complaint, but this has been taking a serious toll on me. The American Lung Association and the EPA have clear facts showing that wood stove smoke is harmful to health, and I‚Äôm feeling the effects firsthand. I‚Äôve had panic attacks from the stress and the smoke intrusion, and I just don‚Äôt know what else to do.

I love my home and don‚Äôt want to sell, but I also can‚Äôt keep living like this. Has anyone dealt with something similar? Are there legal options, environmental agencies, or other actions I can take to finally put a stop to this?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice. I just want to breathe clean air. 

Thanks in advance.

If they admitted to doing it out of spite, you should have a case to sue for harassment and maybe even seek an injunction because they've admitted to abusive behavior surrounding wood-burning.
Keep reporting. Also buy a box fan and a 20x20x4 merv 13 filter with a carbon sheet, then use industrial tape like ducktape to stick it together, works like a $1500 air filtration system for $50 bucks.
Keep reporting them, the fines will add up. Maybe call the NJ DEP, and your local assemblyperson. Also reach out to a civil litigation attorney, they'll at the very least give you a free consultation, possibly have their office draft a cease and desist or something like that. Not sure what the exact procedure is, I've never sued anyone. They'll have a better grasp on it and are honestly who you should be talking to instead of Reddit.

This is massive asshole behavior that is having a tangible impact on your health, there's quite a few bells you can ring and you should yank on every goddamned one as hard as you can. People like this act this way because they think they can get away with it - prove him wrong.
Have you considered talking to a lawyer? You might be able to file a case and get an order for them to stop if you have proof it‚Äôs egregious. Many lawyers offer feee consults. 

I don‚Äôt know about monetary judgements, but a judge might be able to order them to stop. Look online, there might be a magistrate or mediation board or something that can handle these cases without lawyers, like small claims but for minor disputes.

There‚Äôs always the petty route too. Security spotlights, cameras, spite fences, etc. if you wanna go that way. Not recommended, obviously.
Illegal with a fine means legal for a price: i got a feeling they gunna keep at it.
ask neighbors on next door app how to handle and sit back and watch the s show.
NJDEP regulates smoke, dust, and noise. They're a P.I.T.A. to deal with as far as getting them to come out but they have a much bigger hammer than local.
Fire Inspector or Fire Marshall in your town? Or escalate to the county DEP or NJ DEP?
> The first time, they actually admitted to doing it out of spite

Out of spite for what?
I hate to say it but it sounds like it's time to move. You and your dog may be literally getting poisoned. Is fighting this worth that?

  
At the very least I would try to figure out how toxic this smoke is.
I wonder if they are burning office paper or something else that makes it particularly foul. If so they are probably not doing their own lungs any favors.
EPA is who you need to contact.
this thread is wild lol

the epa is not going to get involved because of a wood stove and a neurotic woman who has *500 videos and pics of said perfectly legal stove*

you think this person is targeting you because they... often use it when people get home from work lol
Go rogue: mix concrete in a bucket, and when they are out, pour it down the chimney of the stove. Make sure they don‚Äôt have back yard cameras.
Thick noxious white smoke is dihydrogen monoxide, ¬†you should panic.
File a lawsuit. If you have admission of fault in writing you have a case for harassment and much more. You'll win the case and hopefully they'll stop buring or change where thr vent for stove is
Talk to a lawyer, if they can find a way to litigate, these people will then have to put up more money. It's your only option to find a quicker way out of it if your town does nothing.
Most likely a fireplace, wood stoves are clean burning. Luckily its getting warmer so you have the summer to look for a better place.
At night they may ""choke the fire down"" so it lasts until morning. It doesn't burn efficiently and creates a lot of smoke.

I have burned pallet wood before and even though it was heat treated (not supposed to have chemicals in the wood) it can have a lot of tree sap and smell really bad. Maybe they are burning pallets.

So, what can you do? Have you shared your videos with them they might not even realize how bad it is for you. The smoke probably isn't affecting them.

Talk with other neighbors (if you have them) I'm sure they have the same problem. You will have more power in numbers.

Try not to make enemies out of the ""woodburners"" they are your neighbors, and you have to live with them. Avoid bringing in outside forces (government) if possible because the ""woodburners"" will probably resent you and may retaliate in other ways (people can be very petty). Be as diplomatic as possible. Talk to them in person. Ask them what wood they burn. Hardwood is better but more expensive. Maybe you could throw some money there way if they can't afford better wood (or buy it for them so you know where the money is going). Maybe they could upgrade their stove to pellets.

Upgrade your windows and doors so there is no draft. Run your furnace fan (if you have one) and change your filters often (upgrade filters to better quality). Get air purifiers (heavy duty commercial grade, not ""as seen on tv crap""). These won't solve the problem but will at least improve your quality of life.
Can she prove it?
No, that makes too much sense. 

Burn their house down to show them what it's like living with all the smoke.

Please oh please give me your downvotes.
Why stop at the local assemblyperson? 

Go right to Trump.

He will fix it. He will fix it real good.
No no, she loves her house, and she will die defending it.
You know EPA is federal, right?
Hmm I wonder why they would start the fire when she gets home from work? Maybe around 5 pm when the sun goes down and it starts getting cold?

Where is she? Is it a rural area? They have probably been there for 50 years. She moves in 2 years ago to get away from the urban folk and now she wants to change these people's way of life. How about she moves to a gated HOA where they have rules about everything. 

Okay people down vote me in to oblivion.
You should use a /s for us stupid people.
Dihydrogen monoxide = water.

This is not what OP is talking about.
So your solution is basically don't bother people creating this situation? F that. Id burn their house down before I just accepted their actions ruining my ability to live.
This has gone beyond responsible wood-burning. OP says the neighbors admitted to deliberately creating excessive and/or toxic smoke out of spite.

Yeah, OP said they said that.

You just defending someone burning wood.
As someone who has burned wood, I was trying to show what the other persons perspective may be.
If you were told you're flooding someone's house with smoke you'd continue to burn? Id think you'd probably try to find a solution. This person was told twice. 

If they want fire.....give them fire.
Okay okay, burn their house down.

Problem solved 

Case closed

Thank you.
No I'm saying why would a ""wood burner"" continue to think this is ok? You said yourself they should pay them????
I said ""they should pay them""????
""maybe throw some money their way""...  A dude ruining your life? Offer them money of course ....
We don't know the whole story.

If my neighbor is burning pallet wood to stay warm at night, then I might buy them better wood if it is affecting my health.

If they are burning tires to try and kill me then it's different.

If you would like to continue debating keep going if not...

He finally let me  go. 

I swear I need to carry around my birth certificate!!! All bc I‚Äôm American Indian. Feel like asking who‚Äôs the foreigner here??? Possibly you????

This never happened, not at this level, till Trump came along. Oh ppl thought I was mixed but never asked in a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt belong here‚Äù way. 

Had a new neighbor around this time. She told me daily to go back to country I came from. Illinois is a state, part of USA, is what  I told her repeatedly. She thought I was Arab!!!

You ain't getting probation for espionage or sabotage so it's probably safe to assume he tried to export something minor.  There's no details on this which is absurd
Half of our current government is agents of foreign governments. They don‚Äôt make bangin ass noodles.
Why‚Äôs that?
Yet he wasn‚Äôt deported or sent to federal prison or sentenced to death for treason? I wonder what the full story is. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for him to be walking free at all, let alone deported a year later.
Why? They've presented no evidence that he is acting as a ""foreign agent."" This is another way to scare and intimidate people into submission.
I‚Äôve been trying to find anything on that plea and haven‚Äôt so far.
My folks live nearby and go to his restaurant‚Äîwe just had a big extended family dinner there this Christmas. The community is in shock, we love Sushi John! My dad thinks he was snitched on by someone who wanted his spot in the strip mall, idk how plausible that is lmao
Definitely the 1 out of 100000 they‚Äôll use to justify the other 99999 arrests
funny how that got buried and not in the headline
Wow.  Then you‚Äôre shit people.
Most people don‚Äôt read articles. He was an engineer from china and worked for the government and YOU Never stop working for them.,  the idea that he did something minor is silly. He likely was helping spy on the Princeton projects there. 

His restaurant is great though..  oh well.
Unfortunately things are so divided there probably will be people upset.
A lot of people are going to cry racism over this.
If ICE had him during Biden administration he is fucked during Trump administration. Like nothing was softer on criminals than Biden.¬†
I too would like to know. It looks like they are using arrests as photo ops‚Ä¶ why else would they be turning to face that wall other than to see the ‚ÄúICE‚Äù on the back of their jackets? Seems like a fear tactic. But that‚Äôs all speculation on my part.
Its like an album cover
cops likely provided it to a member of the press they have an established relationship with. standard practice for journalists to have relationships with all sorts of folks exactly for situations like this. there is mutual benefit for police to reveal the photo as well as for the journalist to be the one who reveals the photo. everyone gets a little extra clout
Does ICE normally do perp walks/photos?
Yeah in the same shopping center as the Sahara restaurant, across the street from Tigers tail
The braised pork belly melted in your mouth
I hope the other isn‚Äôt tiger noodles, I believe they are owned by the same person
> if you're not doing anything illegal, you can't be detained and questioned just as a routine check. 

Yes you can by ICE as long as you are within 100 miles of the border (or is it 50 miles) either way, that covers the entirety of NJ.
Theyre sending people overseas to foreign prisons without a trial or even formal charges, within hours of being detained. 

Youre right that were supposed to have constitutional protection from the government but we're so far past that sadly

This is a NJ sub.¬†
His food was really good and that restaurant employs around 8-10 other people. I hope they‚Äôre able to keep going.
I'm willing to look the other way for certain things.
Not great, maybe ok for whities. Way better noodles available up the road in Edison.
My guess is they saw his prior charge and figured he‚Äôd be an easy guy to arrest. Don‚Äôt be surprised when we don‚Äôt get any further info about this. 

Given the stories coming out, regarding who we shipped off to El Salvador to be tortured without due process, no one should give this admin the benefit of the doubt.

I can‚Äôt link to twitter, but the state department spokeswoman said today that they‚Äôre going to start going after people‚Äôs visas for pretty much any reason they can come up with. 

Things are going to get very bleak.
> Zhang lawfully entered the United States in June 2000 at the Los Angeles International Airport; however, he violated the terms of his lawful admission, according to ICE.

A couple paragraphs later is the clarification. It would appear his conviction violated his lawful admission
Back in 2019, when Tencent invested in Reddit, there was a pretty vocal concern what it would do to the website.  Fast forward to today and you're confused about what I said here.
I mean, his story is unique in that he was found guilty of acting as a foreign agent, but I keep seeing stories about folks who overstayed their welcome, were told to leave voluntarily, and they didn't leave, and it's just odd.  If we're going to tell people to go, you think there'd be a little follow-up?  Could've prevented this shitshow.
bruh, it said the guy had a trial and was convicted, you don't think there was any evidence at the trial, or did you not even rad the article?
[Here you go](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/chinese-national-sentenced-57-months-incarceration-attempting-illegally-export).  This article wasn't about his previous arrest.  It's patch.com for fucks sake, you can't expect them to do a deep dive.  They reported on his previous arrest *and sentencing*, and I imagine they have some modicum of journalistic integrity that that's not just bullshit.
[Got you](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/chinese-national-sentenced-57-months-incarceration-attempting-illegally-export).  <-- Wrong Ming Zhang.

EDIT:  I've found [another Ming Zhang](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-ming-zhang), who was arrested and interned at Fort Dix, though it's fraud, not the ""acting as an agent"" language we see in the article.  This is also 2021.

Yeah, I'll keep searching, I think it's important info.
I feel like it's totally plausible.  There was some article on here a couple months back about two pizza restaurants in the same strip mall going at it.  Small business can be a petty affair.
What kind of crackpot theory is this? Are you suggesting the guy who calls himself ""Sushi John"" somehow used his Chinese restaurant as a cover to gain access to ""Princeton projects"" and relay that back to China? Do you think Princeton University is secretly conducting experiments in NJ that are worth having a sleeper agent? 

Like you I've always eaten at YaYa plenty of times. Do you think in-between downsizing the restaurant and hosting omakase, he was also covertly monitoring the next big experiment coming out of Princeton that's worth China's attention?
Idk. You‚Äôre the only one that‚Äôs mentioned race so far.
It‚Äôs to protect the agents from retaliation
I mean they basically made a whole TikTok reel out of the deportation flights so yeah.
What gonna happen to the restaurant the Singapore rice noodles are bussen
It‚Äôs not.
As a legal American you can't so I'm wondering if you can't do that to Americans then you don't know who's illegal so how's the distinction made?
Right but how do you know those in the tracable car are illegal?
Yeah go back to the sub you came from, you don't belong here!

If you drive on the highways along the Mexican border, stopping for checkpoints is very normal. Usually all they ask is ""are you a citizen"" and that's it if the answer is yes but that's being questioned.

I was referring to this:

> He‚Äôs not illegal, he entered lawfully

As for why they‚Äôre arresting him now ICE was basically neutered all of 2024 so they weren‚Äôt doing much then.

Edit - I‚Äôm stupid, they were very busy, maybe they didn‚Äôt have free time

It‚Äôs weird they specifically use the word ‚Äúarrest‚Äù tho, rather than detain for deportation. Makes me think there‚Äôs new charges coming or something. 

I‚Äôm trying to find details on his previous case
I refuse to download the reddit app, but right now I'm kinda wishing I had, so I could post a gif of someone crying.
Damn, I saw Ming Zhang, but it appears you may be correct, too many Ming Zhangs out here working as agents for China.
Have not seen any Russians deported.
The agents are hiding their faces at every chance they get. The ones who took the Tufts student all had masks on.  We are in Nazi Germany 1932.
Well I know the law works if you have money. And rights get trampled on with the old line "" tell it to the judge"".  So I'm not naive to police doing things  then letting the system settle what's ""just"".  But there are groups who watch out for this type thing as well. I'm no expert but I like talking to ppl like you because this is all new. At this level anyway. I don't think this will be a cakewalk for this administration. Disregard for the constitution destroying decades old alliances and sabotaging the economy and threatening to take land of another sovereign nation? Some of this nay succeed for awhile but I think he's making too many enemies . Even those who initially supported him. It's bad but I have hope.
They're making social commentary. It's not like it doesn't happen here too
Not if you have a hungry family. 30 mins is a lot of time for a hungry wife to lose her shit. 

Real talk though, YaYa is good because they offer Thai and Sushi as well as Chinese. Sometimes the kid wants LoMein and the wife wants Sushi. 

Also, it‚Äôs a sit down restaurant. There aren‚Äôt a lot of sit down Chinese joints around, they‚Äôre all take out.
What were the signs that I missed? Just so I can avoid the same kind of thing in the future
He voted for confirm Rubio who's acting like Castro, minus the socialism.  Tbf every dem voted for Rubio but I keep thinking ""if everyone jumped off a cliff, would you?"" Just because everyone else is stupid doesn't excuse your stupidity, ya know?  

And then he voted to advance a bill to undo Biden era crypto regulations which will lead to big fucking problems later.  Booker voted for it too, along with like half of Democrats.  They're bought out by crypto which is depressing

I'm not trying to be a dick, genuine earnestness. That conception that you got that ICE was neutered in 2024 is a deeply ideological statement and wherever you got that from lied to you, d or r angle.

OK buddy 

[Deportations by ICE jumped to 10-year high in 2024, surpassing Trump-era peak](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deportations-by-ice-10-year-high-in-2024-surpassing-trump-era-peak/)
So you're just making things up till people correct you?  Maybe just erase your theories till you actually know.
Not a lawyer or anything, but I think that an arrest would mean that he is taken into custody, with the intent of holding him where detained would be used when someone was just brought in for questioning or something along those lines.

Convenient, perhaps, good, nah. Adding mediocre Thai and mediocre sushi to a mediocre Chinese menu doesn't make it good IMO. 

There aren't a lot of sit down Chinese-American food joints, but there are many excellent sit down proper Chinese joints - you just need to go to Edison, Philly, or Flushing to get the good stuff.
Are you referring to the fact that you voted for Trump? Cause if so, do you have a billion hours?

Well when they are just straight deporting someone they typically say they‚Äôve been ‚Äúdetained for deportation‚Äù because arrest implies being charged with something, and you don‚Äôt need to be charged with a crime (aka arrested) to be deported

But I‚Äôm not a lawyer either and can totally be wrong, that‚Äôs just the understanding I‚Äôve been operating under
Oh fuck no,  I didn't vote for Trump

I'm regretting my vote for Andy Kim, who's had quite a few shitty votes in his very very short time as senator.

The worst one was him voting to confirm Noam as the head of DHS
Is it tho, people keep repeating things like cops can't do anything cuz of liberal policies and you with ice couldn't do anything last year. Yall need to stop. Unless you know for a fact some policy from the government stopped LE from acting, just shut up.
Why were you so confident about that? It clearly wasn‚Äôt because you looked at the facts, so what was it that made you believe that?

I.E their estimates were low which 95% of the times is the case
Looks like previous were estimates, and now that they have an actual reading, you're paying the difference.
My favorite part of the bill is the LRAM charge. They asked us to switch to energy efficient appliances. They even gave us LED light bulbs. And because we used less electricity, they tacked on this charge to compensate for the lost revenue.¬†

This from a company that pays out more the $900 Million is dividends each year.
Estimated reads. Call in, request an actual read or submit your own and they should adjust.

Otherwise, they'll eventually fix it when they take a real reading.
Previous bill was just estimated and then they came in and did an actual reading.
UPDATE - thanks to everyone that pointed out that my prior bill was an estimate. I was able to get a hold of a rep and they told me that exactly. Turns out I was paying estimates from the month of November. Nobody came out and actually measured my meter from November up until something in March. They installed the smart meter sometime in March. From what I was told, I‚Äôm basically making up for the additional electricity I used outside of the estimate. Should be better going forward. Thank you everyone ! :)
Looks like your usage on the old meter ending in 849 went from 634 KWH used to over 1k KWH.

Estimate

roughly calculate or judge the value, number, quantity, or extent of.

You're going to pay it eventually, estimate or not. And yes, the power company sent out a notice last month that bills were going up

If it's a smart meter why would they ever need to estimate?
And they apparently replaced the meter. 

They will now check the meter (required by NJ law). We got a few $ back because ours read fast.
Thank you!
My bills nearly doubled. Do NJ Gas and JCPL have off peak rates?
Ohhh yes I see. I guess since they put new smart meters they prob got an accurate reading and I‚Äôm paying up for what I didn‚Äôt. I was able to get a hold of someone and they told me my meter wasn‚Äôt read from November. Should be better going forward.
The new rates haven‚Äôt kicked in yet. June I think.
OP got the smart meter on March 3rd, and when removing the old meter they took an actual reading.
Likely a recent install of smart meter. Was having same issue until this past summer when meter was upgraded. Annoying but estimates don't change overall cost when annual cost is considered. That lovely change will come in a few months..
JCPNL gives you $ back if you upgrade to a smart meeter?
Okay.  So they been under billing you since Nov.  better for you!!  Glad figured this situation out
They surcharge you for keeping the old meter to get you to switch if I recall correctly
NJ BPU requires they switch the gas meter periodically. 

And the contractor who does it will check that the meter was measuring accurately.  And if they were screwing you, they are supposed to issue a refund. Over time, the gas meters can get out of alignment I suppose. 

In my case that refund was $50? I can‚Äôt remember exactly.
Oh wow I‚Äôm about to switch then, the meter estimate is always way lower like OP and I end up paying a big chunk after a few months, kinda lame"

30 Day Notice to Notify Landlord the Contract is Ending?,"Hi Everyone,

Just a quick question today, but I just confirmed with my landlord that I will be moving out at the end of my lease (april 1st) and they said because i didn't give 30 day notice they need to keep my security deposit to pay for that month's rent. Is this legal? I didn't realize i had to notify them that the contract was naturally ending. I was calling as more of a courtesy. If I wanted to renew I would've let them know with the 30 day notice. I've never given 30 day notice to any landlord, but those were in NYC.",0.33,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jm1vf9/30_day_notice_to_notify_landlord_the_contract_is/,13,1jm1vf9,2025-03-28 18:24,"Most leases convert to a month to month tenancy , they don‚Äôt ‚Äúend‚Äù. And most leases state they you have to give 30 day written notice to vacate. They are in the right to deduct one months rent from your deposit.
Ask a lawyer, not reddit
What does it say in your lease?
my lease says I have to give them two months notice of move out/end of lease. it's annoying that it's 2 instead of 1 but I would assume 30 day notice of any move out is the minimum even for end of lease.

but it should say in the lease, if it doesn't you may have a case to go to court
Actually, the landlord was supposed to notify YOU that your lease was ending and they were offering you a lease renewal.  You then have to tell them, within the specified time period, whether you are accepting the new lease or moving out.

Normally there is a clause in your lease that states when the landlord has to notify you and when you need to reply by.  In my leases, the landlord notifies the tenant 90 days before and the tenant has to reply within 45 days from receipt of the landlord's letter.

If they didn't offer you a lease renewal, you should have assumed you weren't getting one and you should move by April 1.  It's the landlord's lapse, not yours, and they should not keep your security.
The lease states the landlord has to provide an option to renew with a 30 day notice from the end of the lease (which they provided after my first year but not this time around) and I would have a 5 day notice to accept or reject. Not responding would be considered a rejection. I made this post fresh off the call to my landlord and before I went back through the lease. I‚Äôm not sure if their standard contracts have changed to include these terms but it‚Äôs not in the contract I signed. Nowhere in the lease does it mention an automatic month-to-month so we can‚Äôt go by that logic.
Already did that but thought I‚Äôd get the people‚Äôs advice. Unfortunately you didn‚Äôt have any advice to provide so I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre here‚Ä¶
Looked into my lease after typing this and the lease says they have to approach me with a 30 day notice asking if I want to renew. It does not say anywhere that I need to provide them the 30 days. We've had a good relationship up until this point so I'm hoping I can reason with them but otherwise they're not entitled to the money so I'll have to pursue legal action if they keep it up.

I searched ""30"" in the document and looked at each instance it was mentioned and nothing about me giving a 30-day notice is in the doc.
 A 2 month notice is kinda wild, there should be at least 15 days between tenants anyways for basic maintenance (painting walls, etc). These landlords want someone moving in the same day the previous tenant moves out and this is how we end up with apartments that come broken...

Thanks for your advice/experience. I reached out to a lawyer friend who just referred me to someone that practices in my state. I'm hoping we can resolve this civilly but if not I'll be taking legal action.
This is OP‚Ä¶ accidentally used my second acct for this. My bad
> A 2 month notice is kinda wild, there should be at least 15 days between tenants anyways for basic maintenance (painting walls, etc).

Well that's why they need notice, you can't always just get a paint company to come out the next day, or even within 15 days. They need to schedule that in advance, but they can't if they don't know you are leaving.
Ok ask the landlord to provide the paragraph in the lease stating you are required to provide 30 day notice.
That‚Äôs my next step, I‚Äôm just waiting to hear back from my lawyer friend. They‚Äôre working rn so I probably won‚Äôt won‚Äôt hear back for a little while but once they let me know I‚Äôm valid I‚Äôll do exactly this. Thanks for the advice. I‚Äôll prob delete this soon."

Grew up there and lived there till I was 30. Has some of the best public schools in NJ, lots of good restaurants, preschools, and a very nature heavy town. There are four different elementary schools, one middle school, and they go to Watchung Hills which is a regional high school for Warren, Long Hill, Green Brook, and Watchung. Again a really great school system. 

In terms of diversity, it's primarily White and Asian. Pretty sizable Indian population especially. There are a good number of town wide social events going on regularly and young families there. 

Town leans slightly Republican, but I'd say it's more moderate and 50/50 overall. 

Never had to do a commute to midtown, but there isn't a trains station in town. You can take a commuter line via Millington which might be one of the closer ones or Bound Brook, but you'd have to factor in cost of parking pass. Id say nearest direct routes to NYC are going to be anywhere from a 15-20 min drive depending where you live in Warren.
/r/MovingToNewJersey is new and might have more specifics.¬†
Lived very nearby until high school. Very good elementary and middle school. High school is nothing to write home about, since a lot of the smart kids from the sending districts filter off to private HS. Diversity is OK... still predominantly small-town white, but a lot of Asian (South and East) presence. You won't find a big Black or Latino population in Warren itself, but a lot in Plainfield, which is about 10 minutes away. Not sure if you're familiar with New Jersey as a whole, but because school districts generally go town by town, the towns tend to be very ""mosaic-ed"" and individual town feels a little homogenous (split on class, with race and ethnicity as a secondary effect), but everything is so close together that your area will feel diverse.

You'll get community through the schools and events, but there isn't much of a ""downtown"" to speak of, and you'll find yourself in Chatham, Summit, or Westfield (20-25 minutes) a lot when you want to be in a downtown.\\

Midtown commute is meh. There are commuter buses with a pretty limited schedule from Warren. There are more buses from neighboring towns, but park-and-rides are sometimes limited to town residents only. There are trains nearby; to the north is the Morris & Essex which has trains either to Midtown or Hoboken, or the Raritan Valley line to the south, but you have to change in Newark to reach Manhattan. Either way, you're looking at 1+15 or 1+30 door-to-door on the trip.
I would say it has about as much to do as any other suburban town. You get the benefit that there's a lot of things around in general. Lots of businesses along Route 22 and some fun things in town too like a trampoline place, glass fusing studio, fields, playgrounds, etc. 

Feel free to dm me if you have more questions."

There are two issues with water: chlorine and hard water (calcium and magnesium ions). The product in your link is a filter, which can remove chlorine but doesn‚Äôt soften the water, so it will remain moderately hard. If your budget is $30, it might be worth trying since removing chlorine can help your hair and skin to some extent.

Anyone here have their home property tax exempted for agricultural use?,"We already live in NJ but are looking to buy a new home. The one we are looking at this weekend can qualify for the agricultural property tax exemption. The current owners stopped doing it when they put the house on the market last year, so its currently not exempted but could be re-instated.

How much does the exemption actually save on property taxes? I imagine its not all property taxes but what percentage?",0.5,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jlz6ml/anyone_here_have_their_home_property_tax_exempted/,14,1jlz6ml,2025-03-28 16:32,"I don‚Äôt know the answer but I do know there is talk in the legislature to tighten this up as apparently it is rife with abuse.
When I lived on a farm in Farmingdale, the acre the house was on paid $6,000 a year in taxes and the ~11 acres the farm was on paid $70 total.
Make sure that they paid back two years of full assessed taxes or you will be stuck with it.
Yeah it depends if you apply for a 3A or 3B classification. 3A would be a split between farm assessed and personal residence/property. So the house you live in and yard as one part and then say the rest of the lot that is for farm (firedwood/xmas trees etc...). I guess it would be a proportional split of the land assessment in this case.

3B would be the full lot.
Is it a farmland agricultural exemption or a woodland/wetland exemption?

Just up front, farmland exemptions require you to actually farm or use that land for agricultural purposes. Grow food for people, or livestock, or keep livestock on it. You need to do it every year, you need to make a certain amount of money per acre, and you need to document it. Unless you're planning on farming or boarding horses, it probably won't save you as much money as you spend farming.

Woodland/wetland is a lot more relaxed.

[Here are the by-county tax assessment value tables for farmland ](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/lpt/farmland.shtml)if you want to do the math yourself. I'm not sure where to find those numbers for woodland/wetland.
compare the prior year's assessments to the current if they've stopped receiving the exemption. The benefits can be huge (thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars in savings). That being said, the state seems to be moving towards stricter enforcement around it.
Farm Land Qualified Assessment with split the property with 1-2 acres as improved and the remaining acres as Farm Assessed. You will be required to either harvest or produce an agricultural product for a minimal amount. $500-$2000 of product. Ie. firewood, hay, eggs, equine boarding‚Ä¶this a whole list of things you can sell. Check with the local zoning board to make sure what you are allowed to harvest or sell.
I have some experience with this, just not in NJ.

The short of it is, not much. In most of NJ about half your property value will be the house itself, and the other half will be the land. Yeah, if you have massive amounts of land in a hot area, it may split a bit differently but if we are talking just a couple of acres, thats what it is. 

So at the end of it you are looking at a reduction in tax on maybe half of your taxes. 

So maybe, 20, 25% or so of your overall tax bill at the end of the day. If you are actually doing real use on it, and not just ""i bought a goat and planted some tomatoes, where is my exemption"", its not a big deal to maintain compliance. If you are dicking around with it though, it will be very hard to stay in compliance without breaking the law.

In other words, unless you actually intend and are going to invest in being a farmer, or horse trader, or whatever, and don't have a massive chunk of land, any benefit you get out of it is just gaming the system, and subject to change, and well, wrong.
Aren't the previous year's taxes usually included with the listing?
Call the local tax assessor and ask them to explain the farm exemption to you.  Keep in mind, to have a farm exemption you have to derive a certain amount of income from farm product.  Such as, selling eggs, milk, having a produce stand where you sell vegetables and fruit; growing hay and selling it to horse stables, etc.

The farmland exemption is SUBSTANTIAL.
yeah i know of a place in Sparta that a rich fuck owns. 60+ acres with a huge old stone mansion plus pool and pool house. Has the whole lot assessed 3B for firewood and pays $200 a year in taxes on it.

Jack from Mendham
Yep, this is it. 

If you're 3a and bee keep on 100sqft of land. Just the 100sqft is taxed differently. Or if 5 of 10acres is wooded and you sell wood. That 5 acres is taxed differently.

Her kid is in 5th and this is how she gets a window into what the kids are learning? You can look up your schools curriculum. You can look up nj state standards. You could be asking your kids directly, every day, what they are doing in school. You could look at their google classroom or online portals. You could regularly talk to the teacher when picking up your kid. You could routinely go over assignments at home and look in their bookbags.

Do not wait for a storm to be involved or sneak a peek.

As for the assignment itself, I doubt I would see this in nj.
Teacher here. I watched the original posted video and tried to read the original passage and it honestly seemed very harmless (from what i could squint and see). The passage is also labeled at the top as the type of source it came from ""commercial"" and given my experience working with similar reading assignments more than likely I would guess the assignment is about evaluating validity or types of sources which is extremely common for a 5th grade or middle school class. The passage is clearly targeted for a young audience and is meant to use references and language that would be relevant for a 5th grader to garner their attention and interest about development of space travel.  I will say however the worksheet portion was a bit off but there's also a lot of missing context.

Another commenter in this thread made a really great point that I didn't think of initially, which is history often glorifies or centralizes around wealthy individuals, and I really wouldn't say from what I could read that passage was ""glorifying"" billionairs. Edison, the Rockefellers, Ford, hell lots of US II spends an entire unit referencing ""counter culture"" which still comprises of wealthy individuals in pop culture. 

I don't agree with Trumps plans on redefining and blatant erasure of American history. That said the likelihood of that nonsense coming to NJ is highly unlikely and would be guaranteed punishable in most districts if an educator attempted such nonsense. Let's focus on honing our students close reading skills and critical thinking so they can learn to discern valid claims and information themselves.
The top of that page says ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù. This could be an assignment that teaches critical thinking and understanding bias based on a text‚Äôs source.

Maybe actually read the text and questions in the video? It‚Äôs really not bad at all. People in this thread and that one could use a lesson in critical thinking.
This can happen in NJ schools, but usually does not, in particular I don‚Äôt remember having anything remotely political or talking about billionaires in a good way ever, if anything there was a pretty big emphasis on the labor wars of the late 19th century which villainized rich people, I learned about this in 3 different years of school for some reason as all my teachers who taught anything regarding American history always seemed to focus on that particular era. All that being said, it is very possible individual teachers would want to push left/right borderline propaganda to their students as the curriculum for teachers is a little general in how they teach and it‚Äôs not like their administration gives them every pre-written homework or worksheet to use for their students, it‚Äôs all up to individual students
Hitler and the Nazis touted the importance of getting to the children when they‚Äôre young.

For regular REAL ID, there‚Äôs none. For standard license renewal + real ID upgrade, there‚Äôs 64,000+ available. How early in may?
there's thousands of BASIC LICENSE appointments available. are you sure you are looking in the right place? the only appointments that are getting snatched up are the REAL ID appointments.
Tell your boss you gotta go to the DMV, get in your car and go to a DMV in the middle of nowhere, get it solved.
If you have an appointment it's pretty good these days my dad was in and out in 15 minutes for his real id renewal a month or so ago. just bring a pen so you can start filling everything out ASAP.
You should book in the renewal section under Drivers license even for a real Id. You can get a real ID at the MVC when you go for a renewal. There are more than 64k appointments available right now.

https://telegov.njportal.com/njmvc/AppointmentWizard/11
If your license is expiring, use the regular renewal link. You'll have the option to upgrade to a Real ID when you go; you'll just need to gather and bring the required documentation for it.

People whose licenses are expiring are prioritized for appointments. That's why people who are simply looking to upgrade a license that isn't expiring in the next few months are having a difficult time getting an appointment.
Did they stop doing online renewal?
They supposedly post new appointments on Thursdays.
I think they renew appts online Tuesdays at 7am on the dot. I did it twice and didn‚Äôt have a problem finding one local to me.
I renewed in Flemington this month. I had an appointment but they were taking walk-ins.
I had the same problem, stay on the site to see all the DMV and keep clicking refresh, I got lucky and within 35 minutes found an appointment the next day at a local DMV. You are basically waiting to see if someone cancels.
See if you can find a mobile unit, soo much better
You should also check the mobile (it‚Äôs a trailer they bring around the state) DMV for appointments

But intentional ones are to avoid tolls
Toll evasion.
The new thing is to use bike racks to obstruct and obscure rear license plates
It's always the nicest luxury cars cruising around with those obnoxious dark license plate ""protectors"" freely enjoying the roads and crossings the rest of our tolls are paying to maintain. I have no idea why law enforcement hasn't stepped up to pull over these assclowns.

EDIT: Oh. :/
This is the kind of police checkpoint/seize vehicles situation I would gladly see my tax dollars used to punish.  
  
It‚Äôs not just to avoid tolls but to prevent their victims from reporting a hit-and-run accident. They drive into you‚Äîbe it while you‚Äôre driving or walking‚Äîand drive away and you or witnesses can‚Äôt make out the plate. You‚Äôre stuck with the insurance bill, medical bills, and premium increase for an uninsured driver accident.
The background paint reflects infrared light, and black paint absorbs it, so the letters and numbers can be read easily. Bare aluminum also absorbs infrared light to a certain degree, so lettering is obscured to the plate reader.
I've gotten new plates that peeled from being cleaned with a garden hose.
I think on the older exbosses plates they mostly peel themselves.
because they intend to commit crimes.  there is no ""innocent"" reason to obstruct a plate.
I think they r peeling on their own
Who is doing this? Do we have an example photo of this?
And to avoid license plate readers which are becoming more and more prominent. I personally feel that they are an invasion of privacy.
I asked this yesterday, but got no response.

>Does EZ-pass not have humans looking at photos and only OCR?
What pisses me off is I got two tickets (unjustly if you ask me) because the cops took a picture of my plate. Which makes me think why shouldn‚Äôt I do this too? Then I come to the conclusion that I am a law abiding citizen, sometimes I wish I could be an ass.
Rich people think they are above the law. I'm ""friends"" with a cardiologist who hasn't paid his taxes in like 5 years. He says ""I save lives, why do I need to pay taxes?"" Guy's an absolute lunatic.
because a lot of people who obstruct their plates are police officers.  take a walk through a station parking lot sometime and you'll see.
A lot of those ass clowns *are* law enforcement
Same thing with the smoked plastic shields. Pull it off and make them smash it with a sledgehammer. 

The license plate is not your property and you have no reason to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù it. The only motive for having one is to avoid being identified. The overlap of people who have them and drive like inconsiderate maniacs is noticeable.

There's give and take to it


Definitely a privacy aspect, but generally speaking carrying a cellphone compromises said privacy far more(actually giving them a part accurate position rather than an occasional snap shot)¬†


I know people loathe em but they're the only good way to enforce red lights without hiring way more cops¬†


But we also can't be doing the shit where they contract it out and make yellows shorter.¬†


Despite what the liars will tell you, they have a dramatic impact on safety at dangerous intersections. They have been shown to cause a small increase in rear end accidents in the short-term after activation, but there's an overall reduction as side impacts and head-ons fall sharply.¬†


Which are also far more dangerous than getting rear-ended just in terms of physics and all, sudden forward acceleration is what our bodies handle best.¬†
How is something being displayed to the public read by a device an invasion of privacy?
No idea, but I'm guessing in most cases, probably not, unless someone is contesting.
[removed]
100%
I‚Äôd say turn him in but he‚Äôd probably be elevated to a cabinet post.
Probably one of those cardiologists that only takes elderly patients so he can overcharge Medicare and not have to deal with younger people whose cardiac arrest can't be dismissed as natural causes.
Ah yes, those rich police officers on their $60k a year salary
True. These are either criminals, or soon-to-be criminals.
That doesn't look intentional, just looks like the plate is old.¬†
License plate readers have nothing to do with red lights.  Two different subjects.  NJ eliminated all of the red light cameras several years ago.
*the only good way to enforce red lights without hiring way more cops*

Or maybe the cops could try doing their jobs once in a while instead.
Cellphone use is voluntary. License plate readers are not. License plate readers are law enforcements way of tracking citizens and people traveling through towns.

I'm not following your point. How do license plate readers have a dramatic impact on safety at dangerous intersections? They read license plates and keep a running database of location, date, and time. That's it. It's an invasion of privacy keeping track of innocent people for a handful of stolen cars or wanted individuals.
Because why should the police know about someone's travel throughout the town? Why does Big Brother need to have a database of people's patterns? The cameras don't prevent crime. If anything, they help to recover stolen goods at best.
Cause with my luck I‚Äôd be pulled over more if I blocked my plates. But I thought the same as you when I contemplated it.
Oh his downfall will be well publicized. He's a drunk and a user. Well respected in his field but I've seen this dude tantrum and throw glasses of wine across his house for the dumbest shit. My wife and his wife are good friends, personally I can't stand the fucker.
Average total salary for cops in NJ is $123k.
They're taking about the ones blocking plates


And between OT and side work a lot of cops do fine, just from salary most make almost 3x the NJ median
but who will play candy crush then?
Lovely idea


Unfortunately 1312.


It's definitely gotten way worse over the last 5 10 years, but realistically the only way to get people to stop blowing red lights, is if they actually get at consequences every time they do it.¬†
Cant fire them for not.

Better to go with a tried and true method. Cameras.
Meh


I find those arguments lacking to say the least


The fact that 99% of people make that choice demonstrates they've discarded privacy as a matter of any importance yourself included(unless you're sending this from a library computer in which case fairplay).


It is absolutely a choice, but a choice that demonstrates their beliefs that privacy isn't actually important to them¬†




Of course some people aren't really good at being internally consistent so they don't understand that they've made that decision
contemPLATEed it...![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)huh???
For being a cardiologist I guess he‚Äôs not concerned with heart health. My cardiologist literally harassed me to stop drinking. I did.
Yeah, $60k is a teacher salary, not a cop salary.
That‚Äôs disgusting. Most people are struggling and cops get a six figure salary to bully the citizens for fun
That's still not enough to drive around in a brand new luxury car. A year's salary after tax in NJ wouldn't cover that cost with no other expenses.
Didn‚Äôt people stop playing Candy Crush like 10 years ago?
Meh back to you. I find you to be disingenuous. Your argument is lacking as you didn't answer my question. You volleyed a ball I didn't hit at you. Again, how do license plate readers make dangerous intersections safe?

License plate readers are involuntary where the state, who is in power, can track your whereabouts without you having a say. That's totalitarian. Cell phones are a capitalistic choice. There's a big difference.

So what you're saying is because people have cell phones that the police are allowed to track you?

You should read 1984, and if you already have, do it again.
Lmao, plates man they‚Äôre everywhere haunting me
Same. My cardiologist AND my hepatologist urged me to stop drinking immediately. Almost 10 months without a sip. Good luck moving forward!
We just gotta bully them back ;)

Like literally double what you claimed, and you're still sticking to your original argument
that's the AVERAGE. many make more especially when you add overtime
You clearly dont use the train..
Nah I know a couple people that still play plenty¬†


It's also a bit of a meme that it's all cops do when they're on shift, which isn't quite accurate they are on their phones like nuts
Yeah the cost of everything is outrageous. It doesn't matter if they make more than the NJ average, it just goes to show how horrible NJ is for the non-wealthy

Yup.

Same. That was the only place available when I checked, too. I'm 165 miles away from the Paterson DMV.
Except not everyone has lived here. I had a realid in my previous state and I just moved to nj. they wouldn't give me a real id despite having all the documentation at my initial license appointment and told me to make a real id appointment instead.

"$1000 Crypto Reward for Capturing Infrared Footage of Unidentified Daily Air Activity in Netcong, NJ","Hey Jersey people,

This might sound wild, but hear me out ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime flash in the sky‚Äù situation. This is repeatable, daily, and happening in your backyard.

I spent a week in Netcong, NJ ‚Äî just an hour from NYC ‚Äî and witnessed what I can only describe as large, silent, low-flying aerial objects appearing roughly 30 minutes after sunset, every night. Not commercial. Not listed on ADS-B. Not explainable by anything I know.

So I‚Äôm offering a $500 crypto bounty (or $1000 with a bonus setup) for anyone who can collect solid infrared imaging on these objects.

The Setup (Simple but Powerful):

Infrared camera (~$200+ range to make the heat sigs visible)

Phone camera filming both the sky and your infrared screen

ADS-B tracking app (e.g. ADSB Exchange or FlightRadar24) visible in real-time showing the object isn‚Äôt registered

Bonus for Two-Point Verification:

If two people in separate locations film the same object (for triangulation), with at least one using infrared and both showing ADS-B, that‚Äôs a $1000 reward split or shared.

No need to believe anything ‚Äî just look, record, and compare. I‚Äôm not here to speculate. I‚Äôm here to crowdsource evidence.

Why Infrared? Any known aircraft emits heat. If these show no heat signature, or a strangely uniform one, it points to either major technological secrecy‚Ä¶ or something even weirder.

I‚Äôve returned to Europe for now, so I can‚Äôt keep watching the skies myself and I‚Äôm hoping someone local can help push this forward.

If you‚Äôre near Netcong (or know someone who is), just head to the Walmart parking lot, wait about 30 minutes after sunset, look up, and bring the right gear. It‚Äôs elevated, has wide views, and is weirdly ideal.

This isn‚Äôt even about UFOs anymore ‚Äî this is just undocumented, unregistered air traffic happening daily, and somehow... no one‚Äôs talking about it.

I already contacted several media outlets. No response. So now I‚Äôm putting the call out to locals.

Any takers?",0.17,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jlqq80/1000_crypto_reward_for_capturing_infrared_footage/,16,1jlqq80,2025-03-28 08:58,"i live in netcong, i have yet to see anything odd.  i've seen a handful of the drones everyone was losing their minds over, nothing on a regular basis.  

generally we have the usual planes lined up for approach to major airports, hobby drones out looking for the mystery drones, the aforementioned medevac helicopter, and an occasional military helicopter doing picatinny things.  gets exciting when there's a brush fire and they go scooping up water from the lake, i guess.

are you saying they're over netcong, or specifically over the trade zone in budd lake / mt. olive?

maybe they're trying to figure out why our tiny little town has so many pizza places and hair salons/barber shops?  or why we have two whole 16-hour days in the summer dedicated to big boom-booms?  or why a town that's less than one square mile in area is on so many damn highway signs?

Sure that‚Äôs not a Gemstar chopper lifting off SP Netcong helipad for refueling at Newark Liberty?
>i live in netcong, i have yet to see anything odd

I understand, on first sight, they tend to blend in with regular commercial air traffic. You'd need to be lucky with a close fly over to realize something is odd, because the regular commercial onces do not go that low and would make a *lot* more noise while doing so.

>i've seen a handful of the drones everyone was losing their minds over, nothing on a regular basis.

from afar, the blinking lights moving around in the sky, without further context, could be easily disregarded as drones

until they get close enough, perhaps you havent paid attention to them yet or youve just been lucky in not having any close flyovers and even then, its not like it would look extremely unusual on first sight, one must already be paying attention to start noticing something is off, such as them not being listed on ADS-B

the easiest way you can identify these lights in the sky is to wait at the walmart parking lot for 30 minutes after sunset then start scanning the skies for anything that moves and look up ADS-B for a reference, for those that you cant find, the ones remaining unidentified, keep tracking them with your binoculars and hope that their pathway is in your direction, if not, note down their navigation lights and their *changes*, because without those navigation lights, you'd probably never have noticed their presence, so once you see them, you can track & document

if so, you'll get your show, it does require some patience

and some willingness, but also, open eyes

and a curious spirit

Perfect Together
I just never understood how all the highways out Midwest and south  stay in such perfect condition without tolls Yet we have insane amounts of gas tax and tolls every like 15 20 miles and our roads are poop. And before somebody points out the population differences, that just means more people are paying the tolls and more people are paying the tax which offsets that argument completely.
I think another thing that drives me crazy is in Pennsylvania motorcycles pay less than cars to go through tolls. In New Jersey, whether I‚Äôm driving a little Honda Civic or whether I drive an F350 Dually, the toll is the same. If I ride a motorcycle, the tool is also the same even though I have half the wheels touching the ground, but if I put a trailer on, I have to pay more.

Apparently the OCR was reading the plate incorrectly. They pointed out in the story that even after this a human is supposed to look at the plates to confirm they are correct before a ticket is issued. 

But my guess is that somebody is slacking on the job. Or that they don't have the person doing this.

Got a speeding ticket.,"Hello, I got a ticket for going 10 over. Officer gave me two tickets, one for speed and another for parking violation. He said that if I rejected the worse one, the judge would just take the lesser offense. So I'll pay the lesser offense and I wouldn't have any points on my license.

I heard this was something they usually did. I also saw that points only last 3 years while the lesser offense would last 5 years, and that regardless my insurance would still increase.

No idea what to do.",0.22,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jlh6qq/got_a_speeding_ticket/,7,1jlh6qq,2025-03-27 23:32,"Never heard of this. How could you be speeding and parked at the same time? Sounds like grounds for dismissal.
I have never heard of an insurance company adjusting rates for a parking offence.  

I have also never heard of a judge/court just dropping a speeding ticket because the accused ""rejected it"".  

This might be something that happens in this particular jurisdiction. It might also be a case of a cop lying.  It could also be that there was some misunderstanding.  

I'd carefully examine both charges - check the exact wording of each law as written. You can't both be speeding and parked, so one of those charges might be automatically invalid - depending on how the tickets are written and what the law says. 

Talk to a lawyer if you can. A few dollars spent now might save you a fine and insurance increases over several years. 


I would actively defend each ticket, but pay more attention to the moving violation. Insurance companies don't care how many points NJ MVC applies - or how long they stay on your record. Insurers look at the record and the charges. If there is a moving violation, they assign their own proprietary formula to determine any premium increases.
Offtherecord app worked for me to dismiss everything.¬†
No. I think the second ticket is made up or maybe he ticketed me for how I parked when I pulled over??

Now that I think, he said he would lower my speeding ticket from over 10 to 4 mph. But still, he gave me a parking ticket in addition to the speeding ticket.
Ok, I've reviewed the charges. I have two tickets, one for speeding exceeding 1-9 MPH, another for DELAYING TRAFFIC. The officer told me to ""fight"" the greater offense and that I would not receive any points on my license. Yet, how do I do that? Do I challenge one charge and plea/pay the fine for the delaying traffic ticket?

What I don't understand is why he gave me both tickets and not just the delaying traffic one. My guess is I should just fight the speeding ticket and hope the cop doesn't show up. I'll pay the delaying traffic which is less money. It does seem like the cop cut me a break but I'm honestly not sure.
What is the parking ticket violation?
Again, I would look at the exact wording of each law as written.  In order to prove you are guilty, they have to prove each element of the law.  

If the law says something like ""knowingly exceeds the posted speed"", then they have to prove both your state of mind (knowingly), and that the speed was actually posted.  

""Hope the cop doesn't show up"" is not a good plan.  In my area (and I'd assume several others) - if the cop doesn't show, they call that officer's command to get a reason, any reason, and then just reschedule the hearing. Plus, the police get paid overtime for court so they like going to trial. 

You need an actual defense to fight.  The prosecutor may be a nice person, willing to give you lots of leeway, but they aren't running a charity. You have to have a legitimate legal argument of at least a tiny degree in order to let them open that door for you. 

Delaying Traffic 39:4-56 (if that's the law) is still a moving violation. It may not affect your insurance (may not).  It's no points, but the fine can be something between $54-$200 + court costs of about $33.  
It is a very broad charge. Any operation or ""conduct"" (including parking, loading, maintaining)  a vehicle that can cause delays or accidents.  If the officer has anything at all to say about the way you operated or maintained your vehicle, this is difficult to defend against.  

Do not just pay one without resolving the other. This removes the incentive for the prosecutor to bargain with you. Part of the reason they offer bargains is because it requires time and money to present a case - even one they win easily. The threat that you might take each individual ticket to a full hearing is in your favor; they don't want to spend all the money on paying the police officer, presenting evidence, sending you evidence and rescheduling the hearing a couple of times, and all the things you -could- do if you exercised all of your rights.  When you agree to plead guilty and pay one of the fines, you are giving up some of your bargaining power. Get something in return for that."

I‚Äôm about 3 hours away from home and I‚Äôm only going into be in this area for 3 days, so I don‚Äôt know if I can get to court in time. Any advice? Did I get points on my license? Should I even bother contesting it?",0.48,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jlh4ub/did_i_get_points_on_my_license/,36,1jlh4ub,2025-03-27 23:29,"Aside from dismissal, obstructing passage of traffic (39:4-67) is the goal with any traffic/municipal court plea for motor vehicle violations. It's an $85 fine and no points.

I am an attorney (not your attorney) and have done municipal court traffic violations (not anymore) and I rarely got that. More often than not I would get unsafe driver, but usually my clients were facing double digit points.

Best bet is to hire the local lawyer who may be friends with the prosecutor and could ask a ""favor"" for an obstruction. Since you seem to be quite a distance and possibly out of state, hiring an attorney will save you trip to court since your lawyer can appear without you.

At the end of the day everyone wants your money, so you'll pay one way or another.

Which town?
If you haven‚Äôt paid, then you can hire a lawyer in this area and fight it or go to court and represent yourself. 

If you pay the fine, that means you‚Äôre admitting guilt and you‚Äôll get 2 points on your license. 

Even if this area is out of state, I believe NJ transfers over points from other states. But, I‚Äôll still chat with an attorney on this

Off The Record is what I often recommend people to, especially if you're dealing with something and live further away. 
https://offtherecord.com

But your alternative is a local attorney.
So ticket says you were going 13 miles over the speed limit?
You don't care about points. They don't mean anything if your job doesn't care and you aren't bumping up against surcharge\suspension. They will be gone in a year.

You care about not getting a moving violation. The typical ""no points"" plea ticket IS a moving violation. Your insurance company still sees it, it is on your driving record so cops and employers see it (if they care), etc. Insurance company will assign a risk to you based off it. That risk will be different for every driver\company, but LIKELY is similar to you getting a speeding ticket anyway.

Likewise a cop who runs your license will view it as you getting a break the last time already.

If you are going to fight it, the only outcome you want is the ticket being outright dismissed or you being found not guilty. Any other outcome that involves you still having a moving violation will LIKELY be worse than just paying the ticket.
2 points on that one.
Any speeding ticket is points In NJ
it‚Äôs 2 points

98 fine plus 2 pts for speeding and your insurance screwing you. If youre an NJ driver then you should fight it-  eventually plead unsafe if they dont drop it to a no point ticket. if not from NJ fuck that shit‚Ä¶
Brielle, I think I was just entering the town. When i pulled out i saw atleast 5 other people getting pulled over in less than a mile 2 radius, which was crazy.
Yes. It‚Äôs part of the Drivers License compact which assesses points on the out of state violation as if it was [committed at home](https://compacts.csg.org/compact/driver-license-compact/).

Thank you so much for the information, how do u think i should go about getting this?
Not from NJ anymore, unfortunately
Insurance is wise to the no points court tickets and if they are gonna ding you they will do it either way. 

The ‚Äúfighting‚Äù your 2 point ticket all you are doing is turning your 100 dollar ticket into a 500 dollar ticket to help fund the town. 

The only time it‚Äôs worth it is if you already have a bunch of points.
You don‚Äôt need a lawyer‚Äîjust represent yourself! It‚Äôs a straightforward process. The judge will ask if you plead guilty or not guilty. If you plead not guilty, you‚Äôll be directed to speak with the prosecutor outside, where you can request a no-point option. I once hired an attorney, but my insurance still went up despite getting a no-point plea. Years later, I handled it myself and got the same deal.
Not sure how is it nowadays but look into it.
sorry, I have no idea. I once paid the $85 fine and got 4 points on my license. Then had to do the defensive drivers course for $50 to remove 2 points. Maybe you can do that? 

Personally for me, I went to the court for one of my speeding infractions. They did dismiss the speeding and charged $440 ($157 for the charge of ‚Äúunsafe driving‚Äù + $250 state surcharge + court costs) from me to dismiss the speeding and the points, but somehow the lesser charge that they gave did show up on my insurance so that increased anyway. I had a family friend attorney with me. 

If you really can‚Äôt afford an attorney, go to the courthouse yourself. Maybe they can reduce the charge.
2 points
Imo this is the best advice https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/s/sNk8aI2cKT
It depends on town. Some of our more hillbilly towns in the southern and western reaches of our state the ""hire a lawyer who golfs with the judge"" type of stuff still works.

Otherwise its call the court, tell them you would like to speak with the prosecutor. They will give you a date to come in. Some towns that will be your actual court case, some its more akin to an arraignment, it varies.

Dress nice, speak professionally, don't make excuses. Explain you understand what you did, you are sorry, but being a broke college kid\single mom\you had the runs that day, you would like to do whatever you can to avoid this killing you on insurance, and know that the usual unsafe plea will still get you dinged by insurance.

Depending on the prosecutor, their mood, and the town, they may give you some other kind of violation, outright dismiss it, or tell you that you can take the unsafe plea or try and fight it.

If you do try and fight it, again, it varies with town, but the goal here is to prolong it as long as you possibly can before you get to a guilty verdict, and to time it to be as close as possible to the day after you renew your insurance. This gets the clock running on stuff before your insurance company factors it into your rates so it LIKELY doesn't hit you as hard.

You also open up the opportunity that the cop doesn't show, the prosecutor makes a mistake and isn't prepared, etc, and the judge just tosses it, but again, it varies by town so you need to do some homework as to how the court works.

At the end of the day though, its a minor ticket. Yeah, it will sting for a couple of years on your insurance, but that is it.
damn - is there really no possibility i‚Äôll get it sent to a lower charge and not get my insurance raised? All I really care about is the insurance price. Thank you for helping, just trying to make sure I‚Äôm damned lol
I barely drive anymore - Haven‚Äôt had a ticket or incident since 2021 and just want my insurance to stay low. I guess no points is pretty fine
The exact same thing happened to me! My insurance company increased my premium due to unsafe driving üòÉ
Do you have 0 points now? If so don‚Äôt worry about it. 

Most insurance do a calculation when they renew your policy. No one knows for sure because it‚Äôs secretive. But I‚Äôve heard it mentioned many times there is usually about a two point leeway.

In the past 25 years about three times I‚Äôve carried two points on my license.  I‚Äôve never had a surcharge on my insurance or a sudden increase on rates.
this is what I meant by fight it and have them drop it down to a non-moving violation. You have a better chance fighting it in person in my opinion. It will just cost you time but hopefully less money in the long run with insurance.
A no point ticket can still impact your insurance points! 

Here are some examples of no-point tickets that could still impact your insurance rates:

	1.	Unsafe Driving (N.J.S.A. 39:4-97.2) ‚Äì While the first and second offense of this ticket may not carry points, insurers may still view it as a risk factor.

	2.	Failure to Obey a Traffic Signal (Reduced from a Moving Violation) ‚Äì If a prosecutor downgrades a moving violation to a no-point offense, insurance companies may still count it against you.

	3.	Speeding (Reduced to a No-Point Violation) ‚Äì Some speeding violations get downgraded to an ‚Äúunsafe operation‚Äù or a municipal ordinance, which still shows on your driving record.

	4.	Driving While Using a Cell Phone (N.J.S.A. 39:4-97.3) ‚Äì While some cases can avoid points, insurance companies may increase rates for repeated violations.

	5.	Failure to Yield (Reduced to a No-Point Violation) ‚Äì Even when downgraded, insurers may consider it a red flag.

Since insurance companies have their own rating systems, they may raise premiums based on the violation itself, even if the DMV doesn‚Äôt assign points. If you‚Äôre unsure how a ticket will affect your rates, checking with your insurance provider is the safest option.

Keep these in mind‚Ä¶
That fighting it is you agreeing to no points in exchange for a higher fee plus court costs. Usually the figure is about 500. 

If you don‚Äôt currently have any points and it‚Äôs only a two point ticket is in no way worth it.
Wow, thank you so much for this! Is there anything I can plea for that won‚Äôt raise my insurance?
You usually don‚Äôt have the choice to choose what they can plead it down to, unfortunately. If it‚Äôs a busy location, you may only have a minute or two and they‚Äôll be calling on the next person in line üòÄ
Darn, okay. I guess I‚Äôll leave it up to luck, then. Thank you so much!
If it‚Äôs your lucky day and you get to choose, consider these: 

No-point tickets that typically do not impact your insurance rates:

	1.	Obstructing Traffic (N.J.S.A. 39:4-67) ‚Äì Often used as a downgrade from a moving violation, this is a common no-point plea deal that doesn‚Äôt usually raise insurance premiums.

	2.	Failure to Obey a Traffic Device (N.J.S.A. 39:4-81, Reduced to No Points) ‚Äì If downgraded, this ticket may not impact insurance, though it depends on the insurer.

	3.	Parking Violations ‚Äì Tickets for expired meters, parking in a no-parking zone, or similar infractions do not affect insurance.

	4.	Equipment Violations (e.g., broken taillight, illegal window tint, loud exhaust) ‚Äì These do not involve driving behavior and typically won‚Äôt affect your premiums.

	5.	Failure to Exhibit Documents (N.J.S.A. 39:3-29) ‚Äì This includes forgetting to show your license, registration, or insurance card, which does not typically impact rates.

	6.	License Plate Violations ‚Äì Issues like an obscured or improperly displayed plate usually do not affect insurance.

	7.	Expired Inspection Sticker (N.J.S.A. 39:8-1) ‚Äì While this is a fineable offense, it is not considered a moving violation.

They got rid of the meal deals where you could choose your own sides and now it is prepackaged. They got rid of the coffee bar and now it is the same price, or more, but it is just a machine. They got rid of the kosher department. They cut down on the salad bar, and the hot food, raised the prices, and lowered the quality.
I‚Äôve always been impressed with the attached Wegmans liquor store for their ample craft beer selection. I‚Äôve noticed over the past 6 months, though, they‚Äôve gotten rid of so much of their usual selection and variety. Very disappointing!
To me, their quality is still better than the average markets. I can't go there all the time because of the prices, but their produce and meats are better. Their soup bar is the best¬†
I live in Rochester, the home of Wegmans. Yes, it has. It used to be a cult here, if you said one word against them, it was like you spit in everyone's faces. Now we openly discuss how bad it has gotten. The prevailing theory is that Bob Wegman died and left it to Danny, who was so-so, but now that Danny's kids run it, it has gone way downhill. Danny is just there to get his check for the Ferraris and cocaine.

To put into context how much I used to be a Wegmans stan, when I would visit my mom in Lincoln Park and she would send me to the store for a few things, instead of going to the Shop Rite literally across the street from the entrance to her development, I would drive to the closest Wegmans in Bridgewater.
Every other grocery store is way worse than Wegmans but that is not an endorsement of Wegmans
Still decent produce, and great gluten free and plant based options. The stores are large and overwhelming, though.
Still my go to store. Prices went up like everywhere else but still quality stuff. I do miss the prepared meal selection they had before Covid. Now everything is pre-packaged.
Fan of the liquor stores
If you avoid the prepared food it's still fine.
No. It‚Äôs still great. And lord‚Ä¶ Shop Rite is a disaster and attracts disasters. At least near me it does.
they have very specific things that i‚Äôll buy but honestly the prices aren‚Äôt worth it for me. if i lived closer to one im sure i would frequent more but most of the prices are insane compared to other stores closer to
We go to Sprouts, it's new so it's not enshittened yet
It‚Äôs been on the decline for sure. Wegmans was, in my opinion, the best all around grocery store in that you could get outstanding prepared food, but it also had all the regular items you‚Äôd need at a grocery store. 

My first experience with Wegmans was in Allentown, PA when I was in college. I had never seen anything like it. Since moving back home to Jersey and having a Wegmans in my town, I have had a front row seat to its decline. 

I thought a lot of changes were due to COVID-19. I saw the bulk candy go away along with the meal deals. But suddenly a lot of the higher end prepared foods started to go. My dad noticed the high end cured meats and cheeses started to disappear as well. Then our town got an Uncle Giuseppe‚Äôs. While obviously Italian focused and not as comprehensive as Wegmans as a grocer, the contrasts started to become more apparent. 

Wegmans is still a step above most grocery stores, but honestly some Shop Rite‚Äôs and their Deerborn products aren‚Äôt far behind. I live in Monmouth County and I have my choice of Wegmans, Whole Foods, Uncle Giuseppe‚Äôs, etc. Wegmans is hurting badly.
I only go there to get liquor. They have good prices and availability for scotch.
Instacart ruined the in person shopping experience
I still find it to be preferable over low grocery stores. Wegmans & TJs are still where I shop the most.
Honestly it depends on the store. The Princeton store is awful compared to Bridgewater.
maybe the wegmans in east hanover just sucks but i have a really hard time finding common things there. could not find a head of butter lettuce, refrigerated balsamic dressing and something in the dairy section (i forget what). had to stop at acme for those
I dislike that they have shifted to a lot of their products to be only Wegmans brand.  Like deli meats.
Rankings:

1. Costco - Buy literally everything you can here.
2. Wegmans - For the stuff that Costco doesn't have, or to fill in the gaps (I don't need 4 lbs of nutmeg, but I will get the smaller stuff here). Also, their bakery is still top notch, the frozen pizzas are better, and they have a wider range.
3. Trader Joes - If Wegmans was closer to me I'd nearly never go here, but they're alright. I have a hard time thinking of something they do better than Wegmans... maybe the spicy rolled corn tortilla chips.
4. ShopRite - If I need a 12 pack of Coke or a bag of Doritos, it's fine... but their in-house stuff is never good, the produce is generally pretty meh.
5. Whole Foods - Absolutely sucks post-purchase by Amazon. They have really fallen off since COVID, plus Amazon sucks as a whole, so I have no problem not giving them my money. Definitely not worth the premium they charge.
I am writing a novel set in 2009 - 2012 in South Jersey.

For fun, I wrote that the 30 something‚Äôs all go to Wegmans to party on weekend nights.
I‚Äôm blown away by these comments. Wegman‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt changed much in the past decade for me, except for losing the full hot bar. 

Full disclosure, we are DINKs but:

* When I don‚Äôt want to cook or prep, I still find it more economical to buy their prepared foods compared to eating out. And the quality is top tier
* It‚Äôs still one of the only joints in town where I can get a single slice of cake with real buttercream, a cookie with almond paste in the middle, smokey blue cheese, french ham, baby broccoli, fresh shelled peas, wild mushrooms, Stumptown coffee, etc. AND all my regular grocery brands. Not saying I buy exclusively gourmet but I usually like to get a treat or two. 
* Their produce doesn‚Äôt spoil after 2 days like Trader Joe‚Äôs, and their produce shelves are usually fully stocked unlike ShopRite
* I know the stores are big, but it‚Äôs one of the few stores that doesn‚Äôt give me sensory overload. They keep the half-sized carts fully stocked so I‚Äôm rarely getting bumped into or having to wait for people blocking the aisle in order to maneuver. There are multiple bathrooms which are usually clean and quiet. The employees are nice. There‚Äôs place to sit and nosh. 
* The self checkouts aren‚Äôt narcs that humiliate you if you accidentally scan a UPC on produce while trying to find its SKU. You can put stuff back in your cart instead of bagging it. In the past hundred times I‚Äôve used the self checkouts I only needed an employee once unlike 20% of the time at ShopRite or Stop & Shop
* They aren‚Äôt owned or run by Jeffrey Bezos or a bunch of Republicans like Whole Foods or Wakefern/ShopRite. They‚Äôre still openly committed to DEI
until they bring back the individually sealed chicken sheet: yes.
I still like it.
Their meat and fish prices used to be competitive. Now they are expensive. 

There used to be something special about Wegmans, but no longer. 

At ShopRite my expectations may be lower. But they usually have something on sale that I want.
Its gone way down but still beats the crap out of every other store in the area.
Kind of.  Produce is mediocre compared to when they first opened in Ocean.  Store is slammed every weekend and they struggle to restock things by Monday.  I have to shop either midweek or go twice a week due to stock issues.  Pharmacy is still great tho.  We‚Äôre lucky to have 3 excellent pharmacists
I use to go to one for the food court only, the variety and flavors were amazing though pricey. Now the pool of food at the court is very limited and the few remaining dishes they have that I like are trash.
Their store brand items have a sharp decline in quality. They have an ‚Äúorganic‚Äù peanut butter where it‚Äôs 90% peanuts, 10% palm oil‚Ä¶
I‚Äôve completely disregarded wegmans. I spend $50+ for just a FEW things like bread, half and half, eggs, some soda and meat. 

We should all try supporting farmers markets if available! My produce costs are so cheap and the food quality is great.
This is how I felt about Whole Foods in Middletown ten years ago. It went completely downhill after the Amazon acquisition
Relatively recently, after a really strict diet, I decided to have some Wegmans prepared food. I went in with the specific goal of not having too much, both to save money and also save room for dinner. I think maybe I got a small chicken tender, a mozzarella stick, and maybe a FEW potato wedges. You wouldn't really look at my plate and call it a full meal.

  
$18. $18 entire ass dollars for what most would consider a big enough snack to hold you over until dinner if you didn't want an actual whole meal. I was so annoyed that I still remember the number like a year later
No.
I read this and just sat here absolutely fucking baffled thinking you were talking about Walgreens üòÇ
Recently bought a few things and the quality seems way down, more than one bread tasted stale, the russet potatoes were more like mini russet, just not what I remember from a few years ago.
I only go because I like their pharmacy- I mostly shop at shoprite and costco for better prices.

Their bakery is awesome though, better than other grocery stores.
It‚Äôs every where and ShopRites are even worse
Wish they would bring back the banana nut loaf!!  But no, not what it used to be. Shrink sealing meat and you can‚Äôt tell what you‚Äôre getting. Bakery way off from what it used to be. Produce used to be so much better than other stores. Now not so much.
Left and stopped going when buying crab stuffed mushrooms on New Year‚Äôs Eve and none of the stuffed mushrooms were washed.  All had dirt on them still.
It‚Äôs still better than comparable grocery stores in the area. I‚Äôm more of farmers markets when they‚Äôre in season and use Wegmans for staples.
I worked at Wegmans for many years and visiting them now, especially Hanover, is an absolute disappointment. Shelves are consistently empty, there no more super helpful staff like I remember being. And I can find a couple of my favorite Wegmans staples, but overall, it seems like the stores give less of a shit.
Yes. I only go there for seltzer or store brand cereal. Otherwise I cannot do a full shopping trip there because they always lack something I need every time.
One in Bridgewater is decent.. so far. But prices r starkly different from ShopRite.. it is not possible to rely solely on wegmans for budget reasons
I don‚Äôt live near one any longer so I try to visit them when I‚Äôm within ten miles of one. They have upped their ready to eat/ grab and go game for sure. 

I was in one today and cannot find dried black beans that aren‚Äôt fing Goya brand. That annoys me.
Wegmans used to be my jam in the early to mid aughts. I tend to favor Trader Joe‚Äôs and Lidl nowadays - I feel like I‚Äôm getting good value and quality for my money from both. (Lidl‚Äôs fresh bakery is a big point in their favor).
Eh ...Wegman wasnt that unique for me in 2019.
Yes
Used to live right next to a Wegmans. At first I was amazed by this giant grocery store that looked like a castle and was always super clean.

But the more I went there and stopped going to my regular grocery store(s), the more I realized it was mostly hype. Their selection sucked and their prices for everything were 10-20% higher than everywhere else. Their ready-to-eat aisle, perhaps their greatest differentiator, was more expensive than simply ordering take out/delivery.

Now I just don‚Äôt go at all.
I think there are so many options now elsewhere it is not as special. They've adapted a bit to get more variety of shoppers.  For the most part their pricing is still good especially on brand items as well as quality. Changes will always happen on produce and fresh items but it's also due to farms and facilities being exclusive to other companies.  The way I shop is closer to European way so it's perfect but for regular shopping there is certainly things I'd go elsewhere
Do they still have the garlic parm bagels?!
Used to live in the Mt Holly area and loved going to Wegmans in Mt Laurel. We moved to the Toms River area, and I miss Wegmans a lot...but now we shop at Aldi and wow we spent a lot at Wegmans....
Wegmans still has the best deal on chicken I've ever seen in my entire life and I live off of it.

It's the prepackaged italian marinade chicken breasts, 8 for $28-32. Ridiculous deal
Shrinkflation? Probably. That's everywhere unfortunately.  
Still the best quality to price ratio of any supermarket in NJ (IMHO).
so funny, I was just there today in Montvale. All supermarkets are the same (except for the price of packaged goods). What sets supermarkets apart is the prepared foods and bakeries. I was never a fan of Wegmans
Nope. I love going to Wegmans. I got a bowl from their prepared food area, and it was delicious. The bakery there is still better to me than other grocery stores.
I love their eggplant ravioli. And if they discontinue it I'm going to start screaming. I like to go there for gai lan because it's one of the few places I can get it. And I dig the Wegmans brand frozen tofu. Nature's marketplace shrunk a bit. That kind of sucked. They also had great cheesecake but the price keeps going up and I just can't justify it. I'll make it for that price.
ok, quantify your statement. when most people say this, they mean the prepared foods side of the store has gone downhill. and it has. everything is prepackaged. the quality is ok but i think a lot more of it comes premade from their commissaries. that's been happening for a long while. they stopped doing most stuff from scratch in the bakery years ago at this point and just finish parbaked things now. 

for wegmans, as far as grocery staples go, their prices and quality remain head and shoulders above shop rite. produce and meat are much better quality than shop rite (and i frequent both saker and village stores in this area). wegmans has held the line on egg prices better than shop rite for sure. for standard dry good groceries, their prices are still for the most part way better than the other big stores in this area, even on brand names. and the truth is that their store brand remains excellent quality for most products and is aggressively priced. the only thing wegmans tends to be more expensive on than its competitors is milk. i have no idea why but they're a good bit more expensive for milk (for example, a half gallon of 2% is 2.89 at shoprite but 3.49 at wegmans).

overall, tho, there's a reason i still shop at wegmans every week. remains a much better overall supermarket experience than shop rite every time.
I ALWAYS got a Wegmans cake for birthdays.... NOW?!?! It's all crappy frosting and a sliver of cake in between....lost my business completely.
For me, they have lost much of their luster to Costco, where I have learned to grocery shop so well in the recent years of inflation that in the seldom times I find myself elsewhere, I'm finding myself disappointed comparing what I'm seeing in that store (especially price-wise) compared to Costco.
I'm late to this party, but still want to add my two cents. My family has loved Wegmans since we first discovered them in Princeton well more than twenty years ago. It was a long drive for us to get there, but we did it just to see what they had. It was awesome.

When the stores moved closer, we went more often. We found they bakery section exceeded every supermarket bakery - and some freestanding bakeries - in quality. Every birthday cake for our family was custom ordered from Wegmans. Plus, we really enjoyed the nice pre-made cakes they sell. We've moved on. 

The prices on the pre-made cakes have jumped up to who-is-paying-for-this-levels and if I'm not paying for it (my wife accuses me of not caring about price of something is delicious), then wow. They've kept the prices of custom cakes reasonable, but have done so by splitting layers in half horizontally so that you end up with a short cake (i.e., one actual layer instead of two). Most of this occurred before egg prices jumped.

The bakery is where I'm focused, but I see the same emphasis on price vs quality across the store. They're tarnishing their brand. I expect to pay a little more at Wegmans, honestly. I'm not interested in paying a lot more anywhere - especially when the quality doesn't deliver value.
I still enjoy Wegmans and go there about twice a month. Some of their products are cheaper than Shop Rite if you know what to look for and some of their bulk item prices are comparable to Costco. Their produce is very good although I find their meat section to be lacking. 

Their coffee cake is the absolute best.
I wish there was one closer to me. I didn‚Äôt mind the drive when I was closer because they had produce places like stop and shop and ShopRite didn‚Äôt have, like kumquats. But the meat was always so expensive, and a few times when I found a wegman branded product I liked, the finishing sauce was so good, they discontinued it. Since I moved they are so far away I never go.
Definitely not. I like them better than shop rite nowadays. Prices are great. More lactose free and organic variety. Only thing that sucks is the prices for meat and fish.
The internet is full of petty people who like to complain. Wegmans is still my favorite grocery market by far. Wegmaniacs unite!
We did Wegmans 2 to three times a month to supplement Shop Rite and Costco.  After  Aldi and Lidl moved in at best we hit  Wegmans  once a month. Aldi&Lidl aren't for everyone but for us they have  cut into Costco, Wegmans,  and SR.
I miss the Frye cakes. And now the coffee bar.
Idk. I've been there once. I like their sandwiches though
I did a little market research the day before the current administration took office, and plan to do so each quarter.

I found Wegmans, on average, to be on par or marginally cheaper than the local competition (ShopRite, Stop&Shop) but not as cheap as Aldi.

It greatly depends on the actual product you're looking at. It's worth downloading the apps or visiting the sites and comparison shopping. It's not worth running around town to multiple stores, but if you can get everything at max 2 locations, it's worth shopping around, in my opinion.
I LOVE my Wegmans. It's a gorgeous store. The Pharmacy staff is wayyyy better and friendly than Walgreens. They'll actually order my preferred generic without being curt. Woohoo. 

I go monthly to get my meds, it's a beautiful experience. The floral dept is lovely. Their Wegmans store brands are very good. I don't do Instacart but maybe I will.
They're still my favorite. I've found the prices to be relatively comparable to other stores in the area and, having celiac disease, they're seriously superior in their gluten free labeling. I don't pass it on my way to/from work anymore so I don't go as often as I used to, but it's still probably my favorite grocery store.
Well at least those greedy executives haven't figured out a way to save some money by skullfucking sunrises and sunsets.

YET!
Except costco
Enshitification. Literally everything is going to shit because of greed.
Preach!
Costco? Nope
Head over to r/liquiddeath if you want to see an active example of this happening in real time!
ShopRite has been insane with some of their prices on random items.
Idk I think if you can get things on sale ShopRite wins by far but otherwise I think its Wegmans
Also agreed. Products at my local Acme can be 50% or even more expensive than the same things at Wegmans. Plus, Wegmans has more variety, more specialty products, and fresher produce.


There's an Aldi in my town that has decent prices, but they're always out of what I need. Wegmans is constantly restocking.¬†
Agreed, but that bar is so low you‚Äôd wack your ankles on it.
I used to love ShopRite, much like the way OP is reminiscing about Wegman's. But ShopRite, too, for me at least, has lost its luster to Costco, who in the recent years of mass inflation, has become the undisputed king of value. 

Literally every time I'm looking at something in ShopRite nowadays, my mind immediately goes to whether I can get that thing or something like it at Costco.
A friend worked at Wegmans and said they removed the various ""bars"" at the start of COVID.  The equipment got shipped back to corporate and word was that they were never coming back.

Well, they did bring back a ""Wing Bar"" Soups and one or two others, but it's nowhere near what it was.  And, as you pointed out, the Meal Deal was great.  But no more.
Mine has a large kosher section.
Noticed too. NJ selection is all but gone.
Woodbridge still has Heady Topper which is incredibly impressive to me
Really? The liquor store at the Mt. Laurel Wegmans is still great.
Only a select few Wegmans are allowed to carry alcohol same with trader Joe's. Wegmans is only gonna sell or stock beers that show revenue, so it's not shocking to see a shrinkage especially with the anticipated tariffs on aluminum which will hurt breweries most
Used to make shopping with the wife bearable lol.  The one in Manalapan was so good with craft beer. Now it's mediocre at best.
go bills
Yes, would love more of a whole foods footprint size wise.
And even that pre-packaged stuff is wildly expensive now. I used to grab lunch there on occasion, but now if you grab a sandwich, small side, and a drink you end up paying $20+ for a mediocre meal
Omg it's HUMONGOUS jeez
I never bought the prepared food other than the sushi rolls, so maybe that's why I don't relate to the complaints.
And the meat dept‚Ä¶ sheesh
bingo
I have a Shop-Rite less than a mile from my house and drive 20 minutes to go to Wegmans every Saturday. It's still by far the best grocery store in the area, especially the bakery. Shop-Rite's bakery is terrible, you buy bread and it's stale the next day.
Exactly. Honestly, we used to go once a week as a family for the fresh prepared dinners.  It was a nice, less expensive option than eating out.  The kids liked the upstairs eating area and watching the people and train below. Do I remember they also had a player piano?   That stopped when they started just prepackaged meals, and they stopped proving forks and knives.

They've always been expensive.  But there are a few things I go for:  The cheese counter, they usually have a decent wine selection, and it's a good place for exotic meats.  Oddly enough, milk is cheaper.
Their wine prices seem high to me. But I stopped my wine habit yrs ago. My bad.
Once upon a time that wasn't so much an issue. They used to have good in-store brand stuff with many different products around the store. Now it's just mediocre.
Whole Foods is like whole paycheck. Definitely not a fan.
Trader Joes is a smaller store than Wegman's, so you could presumably complete your shopping there faster if you come prepared with a list.

Trader Joes and Costco both curate products to offer, with the latter also including select national brands into its rotation. I personally find this to be really cool, but the more traditional grocery stores have a wider selection of both national and private-label brands.

Whole Paycheck was a cool concept for boutique organic groceries when it first launched but has since degraded into a mere brick-and-mortar endpoint for Amazon that also happens to have (sort-of) organic groceries. Other stores' organic labels have since caught up, meaning a trip to a dedicated outfit like Whole Paycheck is no longer necessary. Also, the rise of direct farm-to-table co-ops in the organic world, where you can become intimately familiar with the entire production supply chain - especially how things are/are not processed, has made dedicated organic commercial concepts like Whole Paycheck kind of obsolete.
I love it
Lame. Delete it.
I swear at ShopRite they automatically classify you as a criminal when you start to use the self check outs. They watch over you like hawks.
As former ShopRite shopper, fully agreed. The only negative I have about them is the re-arranging the store every 6 or so months. Just as I get used to the new layout, they switch it up. Mr. Wegman if you are listening, it will not make me ""discover"" other stuff and buy them. It just frustrates the hell out of me and will make me switch stores...
I haven't been in a while. That isn't an offering anymore?
Me too! I just went on Monday and it‚Äôs sooo much better than my closest supermarket, Stop and Shop. Produce was fresh. The vanilla bean scones are awesome! It‚Äôs like birthday cake but a scone. ü§§
I agree with this for the most part. When our Wegmans first opened, the in store burger place was great.  The prices went up a lot and the quality is worse but still better than most other markets.  We get their bowls and sandwiches for takeout a few times a month at work and its still good if you get the right item.
The Pharmacy is outstanding. Woohoo.
HEHE.

You said kumquat.
Ooh I love kumquats! I have a potted plant but it hasn‚Äôt bloomed yet.
I have an Aldi right across the road from my apartment, so I go there if I need something in a pinch, but the you can't do all your shopping there. Wish the stores were bigger.¬†

Facts.
Yikes. They did a New Coke.
That really depends on the shoprite franchise owner some are absolutely shitty and others are the most competitive in terms of price and quality. So not really a fair comparison to Wegmans
And their quality has gone to shite, especially produce. Pathmark and A and P had the better meat selections before they went under. Foodtown, if there are any still around, have decent stuff. Shoprite usually ranks towards the bottom.
Note: ShopRite is a co-op of several independent owners. They are able to source their product from different companies and have different standards.
Mind sharing which one? I used to love it but the few I've checked have been gone.
Unfortunately there's been a lot of contraction in the craft beer industry in general and the distributors go where the money is, which is canned cocktails and seltzers right now
üò≤ Alchemist usually flies off the shelves. Wish I was closer, I'd run over and grab some.
Can confirm, but as of today the selection was sub par
Heady is readily available in lots of places in Jersey now.  Waiting on Focal Banger to be the same
The nearest to me is the one on Rt. 35 in Ocean‚Ä¶
The law in NJ is two liquor licenses per grocery company- so two of the stores have alcohol inside the actual grocery store (Bridgewater and I don‚Äôt know the other), and then other ones (Woodbridge, etc) have them attached or next door.
every wegmans sells liquor. they skirt around the laws by having the liquor stores be technically separate entities where you have to pay for the liquor in the separate ""store"" even though it's just using the wegmans pos system and the employees are wegmans employees.
yes the different meats is what i often go for! i do also enjoy the cheese selection and they have a huge sparkling/seltzer water variety compared to some other stores
I stopped the wine habit and picked up the scotch habit lol.
Why do you hate Wegmans?
If you even dare move your bag while you‚Äôre filling it, it needs to loudly freak out at you. I can‚Äôt.
I had an employee at ShopRite insist I had more than 20 items in my cart at the self checkout. I told her I didn‚Äôt think so. She stood over me while I scanned my items. The count was 20. I‚Äôve been going to ShopRite a lot less after that.
nah just a big pack like any other supermarket. pork is still individual though.¬†
Ugh. Stop n Shop is the pits! The prices are ridiculous too.
Giggity
Well, enjoy them while you can.

Today's sunset might be the last one you have a chance to see because you never know if you will live long enough to see it rise.

Correction, they RE-did a new Coke. 

They made that stupid decision years ago.
shoprite produce isnt really an option anymore. all rotten or terrible quality near-expired items
I only go to one Shoprite, the one in New Rochelle, as (1)it is 24hr (2)to me, a non Italian(-American), it has particularly good stock of Italian products.

Agreed, otherwise, on the pricing and overall quality.
Foodtown is still around! I make a point of going to the one in Sea Girt once a week. Very good meats and baked goods (though some of the prices have gotten a bit wince-worthy).
lidl is pretty cool and has good prices
Ocean. Rt 35
Goddamn Kids!
Uh oh...Scotch = me fall down often. Lol
Don't hate Wegmans. Think your idea of 30-somethings having meet-ups there is lame...or maybe just uninspired
I use the self checkout at Wegmans when my total number of items is well over the limit. No one cares.
Agreed. ShopRite's produce leaves a lot to be desired. It didn't always used to be that way...
Thanks! I'll have to make a stop there next time I'm in the area.
There is a DJ there.

Has Congestion Pricing led to Induced Demand?,"Traffic screenshot Early January vs today.

Remember 2 months ago when highways were clear and people were happy about their shorter commutes to/from work? Now we're pretty much right back to square one..arguably at times even WORSE than before. It doesn't help that those funds are going to the MTA, which is notoriously known for laundering money. 

Is this traffic:

A) as a result of more people riding due to their misjudgement thinking highways would be faster (induced demand)

B) Toll too low for people to care

C) Straight-up low demand-elasticity (people will just bite the bullet and pay regardless/they have no choice)

What are your thoughts?",0.44,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jldew7/has_congestion_pricing_led_to_induced_demand/,19,1jldew7,2025-03-27 20:54,"The comparison assumes demand is comparable across both time periods. 

Yes, I enjoyed the empty-ish highways post-holiday, but I think we need to see a full set of year-over-year comparisons to say for sure.
None of that traffic is going into the city, 78 is going outbound, 139 is outbound, both 95s are outbound
The I-80 sinkholes are causing weird traffic conditions, more traffic than normal for some roads, less than normal for others. We have to wait for those repairs to be fully made to have a true comparison. 

Also, I truly believe congestion pricing has routed more traffic through the Bronx that used to go through Manhattan. Rich white racist liberal manhattanites are smug about congestion pricing reducing traffic for them while Bronx children who are predominantly POC will be suffering from asthma as a result.
I think that you need to make comparisons at the same time of the day on the same day of the week.
I drive to Hoboken from Morris County 1-2x per week (train the other days).  Traffic has NOT improved since congestion pricing started.  In fact, I perceive it as worse. I assume the primary factor is more employers demanding on-site.
Basically yes. Traffic is back to where it was before. I think people gave the train/bus a month but then realized that driving is easier and the extra tax isn't that much.
Well, the second shows traffic leaving Manhattan (top lane from the Holland is westbound) so I‚Äôm not sure what this really represents. Time, date are important factors. Are these under the same conditions? This doesn‚Äôt tell us.
Looks like there's a road closure at the Lincoln Tunnel. Could anyone clarify how long that's been in effect?
I wish the maps actually lined up or were the same, and the second one not zoomed in
Driving home from city is still horrid.¬† January was nice because january is always nice. Now it back to normal crappy traffic¬†
1. You have to compare seasonally, you cant compare two arbitrary months

2. Traffic is currently screwed up by major road closures due to ""acts of god""

3. The headlines that Trump killed congestion pricong probably has a lot of people who dont read past the headlines driving in not realizing its still in effect

4. The traffic flows in your post are the wrong direction for congestion pricing to be a major determining factor
Traffic is still much better and no way is it worse than it was pre-congestion pricing. You're delusional.
I drive in to Manhattan during rush hours about 1 to 2 days a week. Congestion pricing has definitely reduced traffic but it can still be pretty heavy. Sometimes it used to take me 45 minutes to drive the last three blocks to Holland tunnel entrance at canal street. Now it never takes me more than 15 minutes. They should probably double the tax.
Agree, if it is raining will increase traffic or very cold. Not a great way to measure
This. I see way more big wheeler trucks on 17, 4 on my way in at 6am than I did pre-sinkholes
That was my prediction. I thought it would take longer but looks like it's already happening.
Pretty sure a tube is closed every overnight and they reopen it once the bus lane opens

It is much better !"
[Unemployment] just received this update and I‚Äôm panicking‚Ä¶,"
Does it mean I‚Äôm not eligible? I got fired on March 11 due to ‚Äúmissing many days and working from home‚Äù. I‚Äôm new to this so I never filed before. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre disqualified from receiving payments until April 20, 2025
Your disqualification goes through April 19, 2025. On or after April 20, 2025, return to this homepage to reopen your application. You‚Äôre eligible to receive payments for the week beginning April 20, 2025.
If you‚Äôre appealing this disqualification, make sure to certify each week leading up to April 20, 2025.‚Äù",0.88,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jlbcqb/unemployment_just_received_this_update_and_im/,68,1jlbcqb,2025-03-27 18:45,"Im not an expert but it sounds like they gave you a penalty and you'll be eligible after april 20th.
I went through this exact same thing and had the exact same reaction. If my memory serves me right (Happened November 2024) it means you were fired for misconduct and have to wait a 6 week period to be able to claim. It‚Äôs essentially the states penalty for being fired with reason, but not enough to outright deny you. 

You will be able to start certifying for your unemployment at on April 20th without issue. Unfortunately though, you will not be able to claim back pay for this time period. After this period though, it‚Äôll be just like any normal unemployment claim. I hope this gives some clarity, and hopefully relieves some stress. This is my first time on unemployment and it can be incredibly stressful and scary. Best of luck!
It‚Äôs a penalty because you were fired for cause
Retired nj ui worker, you were disqualified for misconduct and given a 6 week waiting period. You can appeal it. These are your options:  appeal and wait months to get the six weeks, however, by that time you‚Äôd would have either gotten a job and are so disgusted with the process you don‚Äôt bother or exhausted your claim by the time you‚Äôre given an appeal date. You will get all 26 weeks on your claim just a 6 week delay.
Hey, OP - first off, I'm sorry this happened to you! No matter the reason, getting fired always sucks. I went through this last year and did a lot of research.

To my understanding, you can still claim, you just need to wait the 6 weeks you're receiving as a penalty for being fired for minor misconduct - standard in NJ. If you want to dispute the 6-week waiting period, you need to certify every week regardless of the penalty, and if you beat the penalty you will get paid out for those 6 weeks retroactively and then can continue to claim every week until your benefits run out/you find a new job.  
If you don't want to dispute the penalty, you can start claiming again on April 20 and just claim regularly.

I think the drawback to disputing and losing is that you need to reopen your claim entirely and have to wait for them to process it again, which could take weeks - most likely longer than you'd be waiting to claim if you didn't dispute.

In most cases in NJ, you only get truly rejected from UI for gross misconduct.
As others have said, you can reopen your claim on April 20. In the meantime, if you want to, you can appeal, but it will likely take weeks or months before the appeal process plays out. 

I used to work for a company that handled unemployment claims on behalf of other companies. It‚Äôs been about 20 years, but the basics of the process should pretty much still be the same. 

Basically, you‚Äôll get a hearing date, which usually takes place over the phone. You absolutely MUST attend the hearing or judgment will default to your former employer.

Since your employer terminated you, the burden of proof is on them to demonstrate that your conduct was so egregious as to lead to termination.

Things that would work in your favor and likely result in a reversal of the prior determination: 

- If you didn‚Äôt receive warnings prior to being terminated

- if you were never told that future infractions could result in termination

- if there is no specific company policy that you violated

- if you were terminated for poor attendance AND your last absence was for a valid reason (you or your child was sick or injured, death in the family, etc)

- if your employer failed to document everything 

- if your employer is unable to definitively prove that you were the person who engaged in the improper conduct (e.g. something was broken and they simply assumed you were the one who broke it)

- if you took every action a reasonable and prudent person would take to try to preserve their job. This one is open to a lot of interpretation

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, nor should it be construed in any way that I directly assisted you with this claim/appeal.
You can appeal this decision too. It takes a couple months but my husband had to do that when he was wrongfully fired. You‚Äôll have a phone conference with your former employer and a mediator to discuss both sides and then they make a determination. My husband received a lump sum of the back pay in unemployment he missed when he had to wait to claim.
Sorry this happened to you! This happened to me many years ago for being late a few times, but the way they denied me was as ‚Äúinsubordinate‚Äù which is the same as someone under the influence at the job! I was mind blown as I was there for 9+ years and a hard worker allowing them to take advantage of me. Anyway, everyone thought i‚Äôd get it just had to wait the 6 weeks but to my surprise denied all because of how they worded it. I appealed it and was still denied and unfortunately never got one dime! My biggest regret was not seeking counsel from the beginning and by the time I
did it was too late. 
If you can i‚Äôd seek counsel, just wanted to share! Good Luck!
Ever notice Bank robbers or Politicians always get paid...or after just one term, health care for life....nice being a special class
they socked it to ya....if they just put laid off, lack of work, you would collect right away....I'd look for a job at a Mattress store, then they say you where fired for sleeping on the job, now that would be a good challenge
You can appeal it every week but there is always a delay of a few weeks before unemployment kicks in unless your employer fights to not pay you
If you feel you are being denied for something you are within your rights for, then you can contest it by going back to unemployment and stating your case.  If you didn't exceed the allowed days, always kept your employer aware of your need to be out, and if needed had a doctor's note, they may get the delay overturned. There are no guarantees, but it doesn't hurt to try.
You have to wait till the 20th. You will still get unemployment.
Sounds like a for Cause penalty you should get on the phone and verify it may be very hard for you to get through because in New Jersey. Many state employees are still missing days because they are working from home. The irony is amazing. Mr. Murphy governor chooses to ignore any question about people continuing to work from home there is a show called ask governor Murphy. I‚Äôm a channel called news 12 New Jersey and they refused to ask any questions about state employees continuing to work from home with unemployment follow up on every single piece of correspondence email or call that you get
Yes, you‚Äôre being penalized. It‚Äôs OK.
Literally says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre eligible to receive payments for the week‚Ä¶‚Äù and your first question is ‚Äúdoes it mean I‚Äôm not eligible‚Äù 

We‚Äôre so screwed as a country man
You‚Äôre being penalized for 6 weeks and will start getting paid after that. This is regular in Jersey. Just make sure you still claim every week on the day they told you to.
Same thing just happened to my husband and he is now collecting. You‚Äôll get it.
When the dismissal reason is self-inflicted, like misconduct for excessive truancy, there is a penalty for unemployment. Unemployment benefits are insurance against joblessness, and as such, a fundamental concept of insurance that makes it work is that you should not have any kind of control over any event that can make you eligible to collect benefits. 

Misconduct is something you choose to do despite knowing better, which should in the strict sense make you completely ineligible for unemployment benefits. But lucky for you the state is more lenient and only levies a 6-week penalty.
If you were fired for misconduct, which it sounds like you were, you're not eligible for unemployment. Sorry man.

I'm just a random person on the internet though. You should find a local unemployment attorney.
Yes a six week penalty for misconduct. The employer probably reported you were fired for missing too many days.
Sounds about right.
Great‚Ä¶ lol freaking out because I just got fired too . While they didn‚Äôt state the reason, they just said ‚Äúthe company has decided not to move forward‚Äù. Further questions to HR rep, she said one of them is hitting quota and time management. 

So I made my account to file my claim, and hit ‚Äúunsatisfied performance‚Äù. ‚Äî I made copies of the email HR sent me too. I‚Äôm just nervous NJ will deny this ?
Wow this was a great read and help! Definitely will consider all the points!

Thank you!!
He might be eligible. Just a 6 week penalty first.
This happened to me about  8 years ago by a security company.  I had a phone call with unemployment, at which time I was read over the phone the incident report that I never saw, and never signed. The manager nor the security company never said to my face that I was terminated, just ""revoked"" my access cards ""Until further notice"" and told me to go home.

Ten years...and then this. I was panicked, scared and confused.

I will forgive many things, but not that. Not ever.
[removed]
It depends how they report the separation to the state. If they just state they moved on, not the right fit, not fast enough and you were laid off then you will get it immediately. If they say you did something wrong like misconduct that is when you get a penalty. I think you are probably ok, sorry about your job loss
How many employees are that the company?
Learned something new. Thank you!
> but you can‚Äôt really be fired for being sick too many days so if OP was fired for a reason that‚Äôs covered under state or federal law, they may have a good case for a lawsuit.

True, but if you look up your employee manual, when you miss X number of days, you usually require a doctors note.  If you don't, you open yourself up to ""unexcused absences"".
Can you show me where the law says you can't be fired for being sick too many days.
I don't think there is an ambulance chaser in the country that would take an ""unlawful termination"" lawsuit. Too hard to prove anything and not worth the trouble/time for them
NJ is an at/will state, you can be fired for literally anything and your company doesn‚Äôt have to tell you why.
one less than earlier.
Like over 5k
Lol ofc the laws are always changing
You‚Äôre assuming OP‚Äôs employer has an Employee Manual. We also have no information on doctors notes because OP did not say either way whether they had a doctors note or not. If he did, then he could be covered by FMLA. Further, if he had a doctors note he could sue for discrimination. But, you‚Äôre using a very specific example that may apply at YOUR job and assuming it covers both OP‚Äôs situation and all situations. That‚Äôs a mistake.
I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this to those who seem deeply offended at the idea of worker rights, but here goes:    
  
The Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) covers private employers with at least 50 employees who have worked at least 20 weeks during the year.
  
The FMLA allows eligible employees to take leave from work for the following reasons:
- To give birth
- Care for a newborn infant, adopted child, or child placed in the home through foster care
- Care for the employee‚Äôs serious health condition
- Care for the serious health condition of an immediate family member
- Care for a military family member who suffered a service-related injury
- Prepare for a military family member‚Äôs impending deployment.    
  
We don‚Äôt know OP‚Äôs reasons for calling out‚Äîcould be any of these‚Äîand we don‚Äôt know their company but FMLA does apply to these situations and to employers of this size.   
  
The NJ version covers birth and family members, but has slightly different rules about which companies are impacted.  
  
Not sure why the downvotes but the facts don‚Äôt care about downvotes.
Just because you‚Äôre not aware, this is outside of your understanding, or you‚Äôre mad for some reason that does not mean this isn‚Äôt something win lawsuits over when their companies screw them over. Hell, there was just one filed against the Montclair Board of Ed. So, no, FMLA lawsuits are a thing and I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs at least someone advocating for employees even if you think it‚Äôs wrong.
You can‚Äôt fire someone because they‚Äôre a woman, or because they‚Äôre black. If someone can prove they were fired for an illegal reason, At Will means nothing. Also, firing for FMLA covered situations is illegal in all 50 states. Just because your HR goon said they can do it doesn‚Äôt mean they legally can do it. Don‚Äôt be scammed.
lol
Or around that number
> If he did, then he could be covered by FMLA

Only is he applied for FMLA.

>  if he had a doctors note he could sue for discrimination

'doctor's note' is not a protected class
JSYK NJ, like many other states, have at-will employment. Meaning they can fire you for
almost any reason.
IF OP applied for FMLA, it looks like they didn't
You have to actively apply for FMLA to be covered by it, it‚Äôs not automatically given.
Well, the employee has to be working there for twelve months prior to taking FMLA. And FMLA is something you speak to HR about before you take leave, not after you've been fired.
> this is outside of your understanding, or you‚Äôre mad for some reason 

Coming on a little strong there fella

>even if you think it‚Äôs wrong.

Where in my comment did I say it was wrong? I've been fired for bullshit bogis reasons and when I spoke to a lawyer they basically, in no certain terms, said 'suck it up buttercup, it happens all the time'
>You can‚Äôt fire someone because they‚Äôre a woman, or because they‚Äôre black. If someone can prove they were fired for an illegal reason

Good luck *proving* it.
Yea they‚Äôre not gonna sugar coat things to you and waste a fight by going harsher when they report to Unemployment.

A mom and pop business I could see that but a proper HR department is likely to report the same to the gov that they put in writing to you.
Doctors note indicates whether they have a condition that could qualify for disability. How does your brain generate enough energy to keep your typing fingers moving?
JSYK, at-will does NOT allow you to fire people for [illegal reasons](https://www.usa.gov/termination-for-employers). Based on what you think, I suspect you‚Äôve let employers push you around. That‚Äôs too bad.  
  
If OP is sick and it‚Äôs related to something that could qualify as a disability, firing is illegal‚Äîand lots of conditions qualify, including any chronic health condition. Already posted that above but so many smooth brains in this subreddit and so little reading comprehension.
OP didn‚Äôt say one way or another, and if their HR department hid that from them then the company could be liable.
You know OP didn‚Äôt apply. You also know that their HR department/boss did not tell them they weren‚Äôt eligible and couldn‚Äôt use it even if they did know he could. Either you‚Äôre his boss or his HR goon or you‚Äôre just filling in the gaps with your beliefs.
How long did OP work at the company before they were fired?  
What was their conversation with their boss or HR while calling in?   
  
If you can answer, please do. But, come on, you know you can‚Äôt because your two remaining brain cells are fighting it out for third place. Good bye.
This man is a weirdo. I wouldn‚Äôt even respond to him anymore.
This is why you get an employment lawyer who specialized in this area.
Could qualify =/= does qualify. 

Even if it does qualify, FMLA is not automatic. OP would have needed to apply to be covered/protected there. 

Employers are not obligated to accept or excuse absences with a doctor's note. Even if it related to a condition that *could* qualify for a disability, OP would've needed to establish that and go through proper channels (e.g., FMLA)
I‚Äôm disabled and work/live in NJ.  whether it be FMLA or accommodations there is a process.  It‚Äôs not automatic and it‚Äôs not up to HR to reach out to you and say, you‚Äôve missed a lot of work can we interest you in FMLA? I‚Äôve asked for some minor accommodations, mostly around ergonomics and had very few approved.  HR has a there to protect the company not the employees.
I‚Äôm simply giving insight into how FMLA works
Good luck with that too.
Didn‚Äôt say anything about HR coming to OP, but asked if they might have dissuaded him from using it. The problem is you‚Äôre reading so many comments where they fill in reason or actions that just aren‚Äôt in the post or comments.
I‚Äôm the one who quoted the law. You‚Äôre just making noise to get attention. Sad."

Hey I get that but for something as common as a Cold or flu that just needs antibiotics it is a great option. Especially when your PCP is not available for another 2 weeks and only has typical Monday-Friday 9-5 office hours it‚Äôs really helpful that the telehealth is open 24/7/365
I wouldn‚Äôt mind going in person, but having an appointment means literally nothing to doctors. Not gonna wait an hour to be seen, especially when I can just get antibiotics over the phone.
Wow I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that. You should definitely check with your insurance to see if there‚Äôs something that they aren‚Äôt covering as that‚Äôs usually the case especially considering Hackensack is in network for you
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt know about this. Thanks for the link!
Just the hospitals
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm talking about - the common cold is viral and does NOT need antibiotics.

The vast majority of flu does not need antivirals either. Tamiflu is a terrible drug, xofluza is expensive and hard to find. And none should be given without a test anyway. So again‚Ä¶we really need to be seeing patients in person
Doctors too. My surgeon is affiliated with HMh and will no longer be covered as he is part of the HMH network. Please check with your insurance for coverage.
Okay that‚Äôs fine. I am not a medical professional. Just someone who used the app and enjoyed my experience  and wants to spread the info for others.
This is from your linked article:

HMH physician groups (e.g., primary care and specialty physician practices) are not included in their termination and remain in network. HMH‚Äôs decision only applies to their hospitals.

My guess is your surgeon is based out of a hospital?
I‚Äôm going to be honest, your post really reads like an advertisement rather than a recommendation.
Yeah I read it afterwards and thought that too but i just wanted to give all the facts that they told me so everyone knew too. I guess I got caught up in it. Having state insurance doesn‚Äôt always qualify you for a telehealth service (at least for me in the past) so I was just really excited to find this one since they did take Medicaid and NJ Family insurance"
How would you rate the changes at Newark Penn?,"I remember seeing a big PR push that they were making Newark Penn better, safer, and brighter.

They mentioned new orange vest support workers, brighter lights, newly placed displays, and reduced overnight hours.

As soon as we got there, my friend said he would use the restrooms while I waited outside with his son. He came back three minutes later and said something to the effect of ‚Äúit‚Äôs rough in there‚Äù. Not knowing exactly what he meant, we went to have a seat while we waited for their train to arrive. 

Long story short, I eventually got up and went to the restroom to pee, and I was shocked at how many homeless people were in the restroom either washing their faces or having their morning chat amongst themselves. 

‚ÄúRough‚Äù was an understatement.
I happen to go there at 3:30 in the morning everyday Monday through Friday The homeless are all camped out there I see no cleaning. I see no homeless outreach program people
I was just there this morning and despite it being daylight, I was very disappointed by how dark the station felt. How so-so the lighting is. 

I strongly feel like if it was bright like how 1WTC is, people would naturally feel safer, and it would be easier to admire the good parts. 

I'm not a daily traveler though, so maybe I'm just wrong.
Nothing is going to change until it‚Äôs no longer a makeshift homeless shelter.

"Backyard chicken Union, NJ","I can't find any ecodes that specify if it's allowed or not. I just want 2 egg-laying hens.

Thanks in advance!",0.67,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jl7561/backyard_chicken_union_nj/,8,1jl7561,2025-03-27 15:52,"Google ""union nj chicken ordinance""
It comes up with rules
The house on the corner of Morris and Spruce Street had a Chicken in the backyard years back. You probably could get a hen in the town. However, you'd better have fencing around the entire backyard and a decent coop to live in. Keep the area spotless or a neighbor might start complaining.
I went and read through Union's [codes for animals](https://ecode360.com/37566238#37566297).  
Domesticated pets, wildlife, exotic animals, breeding, animal shows & selling.  
Not one mention in there of livestock, which I think chickens would fall under.  
The harboring between 10-6 sounds like it is there for the animal show part so not to disturb the peace.

Everything in there falls under the department of the Board of Health.  
Your best bet would be to call and ask them if or what regulations having chickens would fall under.
I hope folks give you good recommendations for places to buy chicks, how to raise chickens, etc. I have no experience with that.

This is the sort of thing you call or email your town about. Ideally, yes, their website would be clear. But in the absence of that, talk to the people who actually set and enforce the rules. It's going to be much faster and more accurate than anything you get on reddit. Also, it's literally what you're paying your taxes for! Give the Health Department a call or email to start. They'll get you on the right path.
I've done this before asking on reddit. Unfortunately, i can't seem to find any rules for my town. There's rules for Union City, which is different from Union Township. What is more confusing is that there's also a Union Township of Hunterdon County, but I'm looking for rules for Union, NJ in Union County.

Jury Duty Frequency?,"Odd question, but how often can you get summoned for jury duty? I had it in February 2023 (was dismissed after a Zoom day) and just got a summons for this May. I was under the impression that you could only be called once every five years. Did something change?",0.81,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jl6snl/jury_duty_frequency/,27,1jl6snl,2025-03-27 15:37,"I'm now in my 30s and have never been called for jury duty.  I'm honestly mad, I'm nosey as fuck and just want to see what's going on.
It is three years for petit jury duty. I've gotten called more frequently than that and once you show them that three years has not elapsed, they'll dismiss you.
I used to get called every three or four years, like clockwork. Then after a call for grand jury they left me alone for nine years. Now I feel like I'm going to see a summons any day!
You can ask to be excused based on the fact you had already been called within the waiting period. I did that and was excused. That said, I thought it was three years, not five, but I also think each county has different rules.
I believe it‚Äôs every three years. That said I think federal could be separate.
It‚Äôs 3 years but it seems you are less than that so fill out the form to say that
every 3 years and they sometimes mess that up
When I lived in freehold years ago they called me much I complained. I was in college at the time living with my parents and got called 7x in a 3 year period between federal and county. I finally called up the clerks office to ask why and was told they had me listed 3x in the computer as a mistake and that they would correct it. I had been continually being deferred because I was a full time student 

Years later I got another summons and had to go in. We all had to go to a court room and the judge went over the rules and then asked if anyone had a hard ship if they couldn‚Äôt serve petit jury. About 90% raised their hands. Turned out the check on system they used online offered no deferment option and that was a mistake. We all got deferred and then when my time came Covid happened and they cancelled it. 

No notices since then
Depends on which court summons are for. After serving on a jury in a New Jersey county, you won't be summoned again for jury duty in that same county for at least three years.¬†But if you move, or it's not county jury duty but state of federal that's different.

So far I've been twice in the last 10 years in two different counties.
I got one in 2020 and then covid happened, so I didn‚Äôt go. Nothing before or after! I‚Äôm in my mid 40s.
I'm 60 and I've only been summoned 2x.
I‚Äôm dying to be on a jury‚Ä¶.maybe one day I can fulfill my duty as a citizen. I‚Äôve been called twice but was dismissed.
I got called when I was just out of college and it was great I had nothing better to do and it was an interesting way to spend a few days.
Just wait‚Ä¶ my husband and I were the same and then I got called in February and he just called for April
Did you register to vote?
Oooh that was me until around Thanksgiving. My very first summons after dodging it for almost two decades. For multiple reasons I couldn't go, even if I wanted to. Ya snooze ya lose!
That was me as well. I then got a summons to serve on a Grand Jury and regretted feeling that way.
I'm almost 40.  I was called twice, when I was in college, and they let me defer both times because both were during finals week.  I haven't gotten called since and I'm so paranoid that I have been called and somehow missed it.
It took me until 50 to get called. Then I did and it was a murder case with pictures. It was not fun one bit. Best part of story is last witness caused a mistrial and he ended up taking a plea üò©
WORD. I just called and they dismissed me right away. Thanks!!
The three year rule is state wide. It used to be 5 years, but it was changed to three in 2004 because the courts were having trouble maintaining a sufficient juror pool.
I served on a federal jury for a trial that lasted a month and a half. I was then called for county literally one week after it was finished. Thankfully I wasn‚Äôt needed by the county. 

That said, I ended up serving on a jury on a week long county civil trial a few years later. Both were very interesting and I‚Äôm glad I got to experience them.
Yes! I‚Äôve voted every year since I was 18!
Awesome! You're not crazy though - it used to be 5 years but they changed it to 3 in 2004.
Good clarification. Thank you. I knew I had the number of years but didn‚Äôt realize it was statewide.
I‚Äôm generally willing to go through jury duty, but they always seem to get the slots filled before they ever get to me.

When I was living in NYC, it was a huge pool and they took half the room. Turns out that was the selection panel for the Weinstein case. They cut off maybe 10-15 numbers ahead of me."

Soup Dumpling Plus for the style you most commonly get in the US, Dumpling Den for variety and a version that might be slightly more authentic. I prefer SDP style, but we get DD when we want a sampler (they've got all KINDS of great dumplings)

Not soup dumplings, neighbor, but have you tried Pho34 in downtown?

We love it.
Not particularly close to you, but Dao Madison has really good soup dumplings
If you happen to be in the Cherry Hill area, Dim Sum House is supposed to have good soup dumplings. Their next door neighbor, Brother's Seafood, has excellent dim sum overall and decent soup dumplings.

But if you're that close to Philly, you might as just drive to Dim Sum Garden for a once in a while trip.
Tasty Moment im Edison!
I like the soup dumplings at Chengdu 23 in Wayne.
I went to Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao in Cherry Hill a few months ago for the first time and really liked it!
If you feel like taking a drive up to Edison, Tasty Moment has some banging soup dumplings.  The rest of the menu is also spectacular, but there is usually a line out the door for their soup dumplings.
I haven't been although have heard good things.  theres a nan xiang soup dumpling restaurant in cherry hill, from a small chain out of nyc https://nanxiangxiaolongbao.com/
Chef Ge in Highland Park. Maybe an hour from you?
Not at all the same thing, but the Aldi in brick right now has Nepalese momos in the freezer!¬†
Your best spots to go to will be in Edison or Fort Lee in NJ.  Otherwise, there are a few good places in Philly and, of course, NYC Chinatown.
Shanghai Bun in Princeton Junction are good but the skins are a little thicker.
Dumpling den- fort Lee
LaoWu Shanghai Dumpling is amazing. Then you can go to Sweet Dynasty Ice Cream, which is just a few doors down, for dessert.
This is the spot
Unfortunately in the past couple years they've gone to absolute shit. Basically once they reopened post covid, they switched to machine made dumplings. you might as well go to h mart and buy the frozen wei chuan bags.
They have a second location in north Brunswick and it‚Äôs gorgeous and totally underrated!
For the love of god do not go to Shanghai Dumpling. It used to be good years ago then they switched to a self serve model and the dumplings are clearly the same frozen you can buy at a grocery store when they used to be handmade.
This guy just told you the best spot around!!!
Soup dumpling plus is the spot, also always stop by Hiram‚Äôs for a couple glizzies before or after hehe
That whole area has a lot to offer. I wish I didn't have to drive all the way up to mitsuwa to score fois gras, a5 wagyu, and bluefin otoro at market. The traffic is horrendous but the gear, so good.
Honorable mention down the road is petit soo chow. 

They were THE place forever, but i believe the old lady who used to make them, basically to order, found enlightenment through them and moved on. 

They are still really good, just not the 10/10 every time.
SDP is great, but damn I hate driving and parking in Fort Lee
The Ugly dumpling in Holmdel is absolute shit. The one in edison is less garbage.
I didn‚Äôt think the food was terrible (although I only tried the vegan options) but it wasn‚Äôt *amazing* or anything. It honestly feels like you pay for the aesthetic, which is ridiculous when there are a thousand better restaurants within walking distance!¬†
They make soup dumplings at Trader Joe‚Äôs??

*owl-shaped outline left drifting in the air*
OMG. I‚Äôm addicted to that place. I love it!! I also love Pho Viet Express :) they also have great food
I heard Chengdu 23 had closed! Or that it had changed massively and was terrible now or something like that
This is the way
This place is bomb. Gets very crowded so try to go off-hours.
It's always my first or last spot in Edison and usually the motivation for the trip. I live in Brick. But I love H-Mart and the Indian groceries and there's no shortage of good hot pot, korean barbeque, sushi. Everything that's harder to come by at the Jersey shore.
Apparently the owner of Shanghai Dumpling got into a disagreement with his son and left to open LaoWu's instead. LaoWu's has the original staff of Shanghai. Not sure what the son is doing with Shanghai these days but heard it's bad now.
I really hope that's not true. The dumplings were the same last time I went, which was a while ago.
This is the first positive thing I've ever had to say about fort lee. My post history is ripe with what I like to call ""an ongoing essay series, 'My Wildly Personal Nut against Fort Lee'"".


Won't lie, it hurt. But I wasn't going to leave a soup dumpling fan without their fix. Solidarity
As someone who lived in Shanghai, the Trader Joe‚Äôs are the best frozen ones I‚Äôve ever had.
Thank you for the recommendation!
This is definitely the way
Well that's very disappointing. I hadn't realized how long it's been since I had visit until you commented.
We went two months ago thinking it was the same before Covid. The restaurant looks completely different. It‚Äôs all self order and honestly I didn‚Äôt see anyone in the kitchen so I can only assume the food came frozen. It‚Äôs not what it used to be unfortunately.

How did I prove your point? And I‚Äôm not trying to argue with you; I‚Äôm providing education from what I know to be facts, what I‚Äôve seen and what has been taught to me. Police go out to psychiatric emergency calls; this is called ARRIVE Together. A clinical social worker accompanied law enforcement to an immediate psychiatric emergency. This is different than all of 988 calls. If a person calls 988 and disclosed harm to self/others..988 clinicians call police, yes.

This may not be helpful now but when your child turns three, definitely look into your towns school district to see if she‚Äôd qualify for free preschool.

Didn‚Äôt properly stop for a school bus. I know it‚Äôs my fault and I‚Äôm sorry for it. I am not seeking sympathy but what should I expect?,"Good morning everyone, so yesterday as I was on my commute home there was a school bus ahead of me that began to flash its yellow lights as I was maybe 200-250 feet (3-5) seconds away from it. I had saw some parents waiting outside, but at this point they were well behind me so I assumed that the bus was flashing yellow in anticipation of stopping for them. In hindsight I should‚Äôve just slowed to a roll and gotten ready to stop regardless, but I was being stupid and allowed frustration from my day to spill over into my driving decisions. So I slowed down a little bit from the speed limit (40 mph) but not enough to stop on a dime. As I was preparing to pass the front of the bus, the bus stopped suddenly, the red lights came on, and the stop sign began to engage. The driver honked at me as I passed. I feel awful for being so impatient and I‚Äôve been stressing about it for the last day and a half. 

Regardless, has anyone done something similar before? And what came of it? A lot of people on different subreddits give inconsistent information regarding this kind of stuff in New Jersey and I want to know what I should expect if possible. I have a totally clean record apart from this and this happened in Gloucester County.

That's likely the end of it. Slow down next time.
Nothing will happen and I can assure you the bus driver probably has this happen to them daily if not hourly. Just be more careful next time because it is a huge fine if a cop were to catch you.
A school bus was literally overturned on 195 today‚Ä¶ stopping for a school bus filled with children is worth the time. In every single scenario.
Lingering guilt for the rest of your life. And a reminder that you were lucky no one was hurt.
But if the cops do show up, I suggest you don't admit to sharing confidential information about national security.
This happened to me once. ONCE. I was so scared of what could have happened that I never did it again. When I was younger. Like you, I was so nervous about what would happen. Because contrary to what people are posting in here, you could get fined pretty big. And if you hurt somebody, you're in for a whole legal mess. It could cost you a lot. So those things were going through my head too. If the driver takes your driver's license, they will report it. Because that stuff pisses them off. And these days, everybody's got cameras on their Dash so your license plate could be recorded. And the fines are pretty steep. But aside from fines, one day, you could kill a kid.


 It sounds like you're upset with yourself, and so take it as a lesson.  Don't ever do it again.  The couple of seconds or minutes you think you're gaining could cost you or someone else everything.
If stop arm has cameras, you‚Äôll get a ticket in the mail. It‚Äôs a mandatory court appearance, could get you to five points on your license. I guess just hope that it didn‚Äôt have cameras and that if it did, they will plea you down to a lesser fine.
Don't worry about it, what you did was the equivalent of going through a yellow traffic light. If the bus was stopped with red lights flashing, that would have been a violation.

It seems that these days, kids don't wait at a bus stop anymore. They get picked up at their door. I leave for work earlier during school season because I'd rather wake up 30 minutes earlier than to get stuck behind a bus that stops every few blocks. To add insult to injury, the kids often are not ready and the bus will sit there for a minute (seems like an hour) before it moves on the the next.
as someone who lived across the river from trenton for a while, i can say this is a certified NJ driver moment and nobody is surprised / will be thinkin about it later in the day

, everyone is okay, so no need to worry or overthink, you‚Äôre only harming yourself doing so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø just learn from the mistake
10-20 in a max security prison
It depends if the bus is outfitted with a camera, which many have now. 

If so, the driver could report you. There‚Äôs no way to know if that will happen.
What is the actual rule?  I stop if lights are blinking, but inch by if no lights are on.
Best case scenario you look like an asshole and nothing really happens. Worst and definitely not implausible by any means, bus driver radio'd in your info/car description and you theoretically could be on the hook for a ticket/visit from police. 

This happened with my old boss where police got involved after the fact and they had the radio chatter recording of the event and it was an incredibly pricey ticket to fight because the guy's lawyer couldn't exactly argue a whole lot.
No...  I was trained to stop for school buses, but I'm not originally from NJ..  Some foreign friends keep asking me about this rule/law.  Its because they keep seeing NJ drivers blow past school buses with lights flashing.

Unfortunately, you are no different than many NJ drivers it would seem.  Take it as you like.  Good luck.
Yeah I‚Äôm taking an inward look at myself to see why I am rushing and committing to trying to take my time on the road from now on.¬†
That may not be the end of it. Quite a few buses are equipped with cameras and so OP might get a ticket in the mail.
Thank you, I am definitely planning on being more careful and patient whenever I go out from now on. Better to just do that and avoid the trouble.¬†
Huge fine? What about literal children being in harms way.
Just saw that, which is horrible. And you‚Äôre right, I was being impatient and rushing for no reason. In the future, I‚Äôm just going to take my time and let the commute be as long or short as it happens to be.¬†
I passed that crash. That was crazy. Saw them taking some people on stretchers.
If they do knock on the door I‚Äôll make sure to keep my mouth shut about the ‚Äúold‚Äù nuclear launch codes I keep in the shed.
I am definitely making sure to change my bad road habits and behaviors. Not worth all the stress I feel right now and like you said, someone could end up getting hurt if I am being impatient like that.
I do the same, leave out at 6:45 in order to avoid the school buses and then come home between 3:40 and 4 to avoid the school rush in the afternoon. The buses come at very inconsistent times in my town though. From now on I‚Äôm just gonna start taking my time on the road while driving more cautiously.¬†
Thank you, I am making sure to just err on the side of caution and be ready to slow or stop from now on. Definitely something to learn from.¬†
I‚Äôd understand those consequences. That‚Äôll give me time to train, break out with my new abilities, take over New Jersey and establish our dominance over the other states.¬†
I looked it up yesterday because I was ignorant of some things myself. When yellow lights come on you slow to 25 mph and be prepared to stop. Sometimes you and the bus will pass each other with yellow lights on though and once you pass you can go normal speed. When lights turn red you stop if you are in front of the bus. I made the mistake of assuming the bus was going to pass me while the yellow lights were flashing as there were parents waiting behind me down the road and didn‚Äôt slow down enough to be able to stop as I was passing by the front of the vehicle.¬†
In the event that something comes in the mail I will try to just pay the fine¬†and move on if that‚Äôs all they‚Äôre asking for. Some people mention license points/insurance increases but the info on that seems inconsistent, especially if they send something in the mail and didn‚Äôt actually pull me over during the event. Just a good reminder for me to take my time from now on.¬†
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed that I have been driving more and more aggressive lately. But regardless of what happens from here it‚Äôs a wake up call ton just calm down and take my time in all situations on the road.¬†
Good move.
Good on you, op. A lot of people don't have that kind of attitude. And you're right it's not worth the worry. But it took me about two weeks to stop worrying.
Passing a school bus is a serious fine. It‚Äôs a mandatory court appearance and could get you five points on your license. You won‚Äôt be able to just pay the fine. 

I got a ticket in the mail for passing a school bus. Long story, I probably could‚Äôve fought it, but I was offered a plea deal of two points and a $250 fine. I accepted the plea deal, as I thought it was the better option rather than risk anymore points or a heftier fine. My insurance nearly doubled, but you can take a defensive driving course to get two points taken off your license. 

There‚Äôs nothing you can do now except see if a ticket comes in the mail.
I think I‚Äôll need that long too to stop worrying. They have 30 days to contact you from the incident but I‚Äôd imagine if 2 weeks pass and I don‚Äôt hear anything I might as well keep the lesson and let the stress go.¬†
How long did it take you to get your ticket? And I assume the plea deal just means plea guilty and they lessen the penalties? Also, around where did you get your ticket if I may ask?¬†
It took about a month to get the ticket in the mail. Ya, so when I went to court, they offered everyone with a school bus ticket the same plea deal. I think they offered a deal of reckless or careless driving, which carried a lesser fine and less points. I was in Mount Olive - where all of the school buses are equipped with stop arm cameras.
Yeah they seem to have a comprehensive stop arm camera pilot program and their own course for people who are ticketed. My town doesn‚Äôt have that stated on their website but I‚Äôm still bracing myself. Did the school district make you pay them as well as the state?¬†
I don‚Äôt think many towns have stop arm cameras on every single bus like Mount Olive does. I didn‚Äôt have to pay anything to the school district, but I‚Äôm sure they get a percentage of the fine I paid. 

I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but the outcome is literally out of your control now, so worrying about it will do you no good. All you can do is wait and see what happens.
Thanks, and you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôll try!¬†"

Is this a better offer for a home?,"If I have full equity in my home but now looking for a bigger home, do I have a competing offer if I were to pull the equity and present an offer as partial cash and partial finance?  I've heard differing thoughts. I believe it's still the same as financing since the seller still has to wait the minimum 30 usually for banks to approve finance etc.  On the other hand I've heard that it still provides the seller with an offer that is strong since it's less financing for the bank and less of a chance things will fall through. Why would any seller care unless it's all cash. Financing is financing and there's a wait vs cash.

Are you suggesting taking out a HELOC on your current home to use that money as a large down payment on a more expensive home?  IMO that doesn't make sense, because you're going to pay interest on the HELOC while waiting to sell your current home.  

Your offer on the more expensive home is going to be contingent upon the sale of your current home *and* mortgage approval for the difference.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not super attractive to a seller and won't compete with an all-cash offer.

You *could* sell your current home first (move to an apartment or something in the meantime) and then the proceeds from your current house are CASH.  You'd have a cash offer with a small mortgage contingency.

Is it possible for you to stay in your current home and save up the difference that you'd have to finance?  Then you could make an offer with just a sale contingency *or* sell first and make an all cash offer.
A larger down payment would typically signal healthy finances to a seller. So they could be more inclined to entertain your offer
https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/
So actually the intent isn't to sell off the current home.  It's really to help put in a better offer in this insane market. Plan would be to take out a HELOC to get cash. Buy new home with cash plus finance. Then finance for total home like the next day after buying new home and get full mortgage on it and pay back HELOC for current home.
Once you buy the 2nd home, you'd have to take out a HELOC on it to pay off the HELOC on the first home.  That doesn't make any financial sense.
The second (new) home would have a full mortgage no HELOC.
You can't take out a ""first"" mortgage on a home you already own.  What used to be called a ""second"" mortgage is now called HELOC.

Exhaust inspection,If i have a muffler and resonator delete on my car will I fail inspection?,0.63,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jkwdfq/exhaust_inspection/,10,1jkwdfq,2025-03-27 04:59,"They check for CATs and codes. If they visibly see a CAT and there are no ODBII codes you are good to go. Depending on your vehicle removing the resonator and muffler may not throw a CEL code.
Regardless of if you throw a code, any obvious modification to your exhaust will still draw scrutiny (they have cameras\mirrors to look under the car). 

If whatever you have there doesn't meet OEM specifications, or you messed with emission sensors\programing, they will likely catch it, and if it looks the least bit out of spec, will fail you.

Nobody likes how your car sounds and thinks you are a tool, by the way.
no one cares about your car. stop making stupid noise
If your modification doesn't cause a check engine light and doesn't look too ""off"", it should pass.
I have a resonator delete and a tune and have passed inspection 3 times now without issue.
If your check engine light is all good and you have no codes, in general you will pass. 

However, they also drive the vehicle over a camera and look underneath.   This would totally depend on the observational powers and mood of the DMV operative.   If your car is loud, then they might be more likely to pay more attention to what is underneath.   They are looking for emission removal, but who knows how specific they would be.  

I have seen people get stopped at this step and the guys started looking around the engine bay and such. I do not have any direct experience with the consequences of such follow up. I assume they would just fail you but because the removal/tampering  is a violation in NJ they might turn you in.  

Apart from that, put the muffler back on your vehicle please. Removing it to produce a boy racer soundtrack to your life is just juvenile.
I don't know what that means but if you've screwed with the exhaust then you'll fail. Inspection is pretty much just an emissions test.

I would also assume there are economics at play in ""closing"" a gas station for good, when it comes to site remediation, etc. Maybe they own both stations, don't want to compete against themselves, and don't want competition moving in.

We need a pin on these questions that this is not specific enough. It‚Äôs nothing against you OP but shit is wildly differently depending on where in ‚Äúsouth jersey‚Äù. Are you working in Philly or NY and need a viable commuting option, rent or own, which county or town, how far are you willing to be from where your job is.¬†

This is a state of commuters and there‚Äôs too many variables without more information. For example if you work in Philly are you commuting in by car or prefer train, both are viable, one if more restrictive than the other though. Are you sometimes needing to go into NYC for work and need¬†to be close enough to the turnpike?¬†

There are some bumfuck ‚Äúcheap‚Äù places all over the state, but they aren‚Äôt viable unless you work locally. If we give you a spot in Atlantic county, would you want to drive all the way to Mt Laurel, Cherry Hill, or Philly all day.¬†

East and western NJ is also very different in both the north and south. We need more.

Again I‚Äôm not trying to pick on you directly but you gave very little info to work with other than PA or Jersey, which is why I assumed Philly Metro area. ¬†
Depends where in South Jersey. You need $300k at minimum to be comfortable in Haddonfield. But in Lindenwold, you just need $100k.
You're at an advantage in South Jersey...far far less cheaper than north.  I can't give you an exact amount, but I'm in princeton, and what I make now...is probably the minimum and I'm at 93k. I live fine..not lavish, but I can survive.  You probably need a bit less based on where you are
For what kind of lifestyle? to simply exist? Live alone or with roomates? deep in the pine barrens there are some really cheap apartments. You're also quite a distance from good jobs though. Some apartments in camden are really cheap, but it's camden. 

If you can afford it, Philly Metro on the NJ side has some nice areas. The shore towns also have a number of nice area's. Cost of living is going to be higher there though. 

I'd imagine 1.5k/mo for an shitty apartment by yourself minimum, ideally 2.5k/mo for something decent. figure out your budget from there based on your normal spend.
Depends I know individuals who have a roof over their head , food on the table , clothes on their back and transportation . They make about 50k. Obviously the pickier you get with these choices the more you need to make. Personally me and my wife need to bring in 130k together to do what we want to do comfortably

Request: Wife's elderly parents need assistance but are unwilling to accept it,"Apologies for the long post but want to make sure applicable info is all here...

Wife and I are military stationed overseas. Her parents live in Old Bridge. They're in their late 70s and are rapidly declining. Mom has mild undiagnosed dementia and is barely mobile due to other health problems. She stays at home all day. Dad still works (contracting work) but we're fairly certain he's doing some shady stuff with his licenses to keep the money coming in without actually doing the work. They've both been extremely financially irrisposible their whole lives. I'm told they have dozens of maxed out credit cards and have filed for bankruptcy 2 or more times. Dad locked mom out of any financial access because she'll just blow it all on shiny things (she doesn't grasp value/prioritization any more). Dad's the type to insist on paying for everything in groups even though he can't afford it. He gets angry if you don't let him pay.

The problems: Both are unwilling to even discuss assistance on any level. They're also staunchly against any kind of evaluation that would help us get them care. Dad is VERY vocal about his unwillingness to create a living will.  
  
Most recently, Dad had back surgery and was discharged with prescription pain meds to last about a week. It seems he took way more than needed and started hallucinating. He fell out of bed, was moving furniture around the living room at 2AM, hurt the dog, and was very agitated for about 24 hours before Mom bothered to let anyone know. He ended up back in the hospital but had to be restrained. This is one of a handful of similar incidents that are steadily increasing.  
  
They won't qualify for in-home care unless they give us access to their financials and have capability evaluations. Both of which they won't do. Google tells me that even if we try to force guadianship, it still requires medical evidence which they won't give us. 

Wife and I are both new to all of this and feeling quite helpless at the moment. Can anyone provide any ideas or starting points that we could explore? Thanks in advance.",0.91,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jkpvgr/request_wifes_elderly_parents_need_assistance_but/,23,1jkpvgr,2025-03-26 23:23,"They are adults and are allowed to make bad decisions. 

There‚Äôs nothing you can do until you can prove they are incapable of making decisions, which you‚Äôve already said, you can‚Äôt prove.
Some counties have an office on aging, see if they do
https://www.middlesexcountynj.gov/government/departments/department-of-community-services/office-of-aging-disabled-services
You don't mention if your wife has siblings or other relatives who can help out.

If your wife is an only child or has no other family who can help, then you may have to get a lawyer and have one or both declared incapacitated. 

If you do this, you can never go back. So pursue this carefully.
Contact an elder care lawyer. They can advise how to proceed with wills,finances and if your wife should be named as their POA. If either of your in laws have to be hospitalized, tell them that your in law is unable to care for themselves with follow-up care. A social worker will evaluate and see if they can be placed in a rehab facility for a few weeks.
Have a private talk with dad that he needs to get his final affairs settled and give him the names of a couple elder law attorneys in the area. Your dad is still capable and the pain pill scenario you described was probably an isolated incident.
A consideration I feel many overlook is the need to nail down what those two WANT when they die. They NEED to write a will. Get that done, make them do this. It save so much trouble and guesswork and angst later on for those left taking care of the estate. If they let it go too long they won't be able to articulate the stuff they likely take for granted or think ""We all know what is supposed to happen and we all agree"" -but too often there is confusion and unnecessary problems later on, when no will had been drafted when everyone was calm and competent.
Ahhh my dad had post op delirium too   It‚Äôs from the anesthesia not the medication for pain. He‚Äôs lucky he only had it for one day. My dad had it for five months and then died. It was terrible.
I also want to add like I said I went through this. U can‚Äôt force services on them.  If they refuse the service providers have to leave
I'd like to suggest you hire an experienced social worker who has specific experience with these kinds of cases to mediate with your parents and evaluate them on the QT to see what can be done.  Someone who is low key and friendly and they might accept.  I have a close friend who does this work.  She lives in Jersey City  but has close ties to Piscataway and visits there often, so she might be willing to take your parents on since they're in the same vicinity of the state.  She has her own visiting family practice and is finishing her PhD in social work this month.

She could evaluate the situation and tell you what services are needed.  Or, she could find someone closer to Old Bridge if more attention is needed.  It may be necessary to bring in professionals and have your parents supervised and even have a court appoint power of attorney for them.  This can be done and isn't unprecedented in a situation like this.

If you think this idea has merit, message me privately and I will put you in touch.
The county social services should be able to give you direction on what help is available and how to get it. Good luck.
Is he still agitated and semi delusional. Cuz i just dealt with this with my dad. It was helllllll
You can contact adult protect services,  they should be able to evaluate if safe to to live in the house. One would question your mothers safety if being left alone and barely mobile. Can she get out of the house in a fire?  I would check about qualifying for in home care to my understanding you can‚Äôt dump your assets to a relative . Medicaid does a 5 year look back on finances to ensure applicants aren‚Äôt transferring funds to qualify.  Get an elder  care lawyer.
They are adults and are allowed to make bad decisions. You aren't responsible for the consequences of their bad decisions.

If either of them ends up in the hospital and you learn about it, you can *ask* for an evaluation and express your concerns. A doctor there may call APS, but APS may do nothing because they can't force mentally competent adults to take their help. You can tell the discharge social worker these concerns too but the discharge social worker only cares about freeing up that bed. If they go for post-hospital short-term rehab, the discharge SW or nurse in that facility may be more help re: home care services.

Good luck.
Thank you!

Edit: Now that I've looked at the site a bit, HUGE thank you. This is incredibly helpful.
Thanks, unfortunately I think this might be where we are. And yeah, I understand... the relationship damage from this kind of action can't be undone.
This is the correct answer. Also consider home care services for when they are discharged from rehab, to avoid getting into the vicious cycle of hospital to rehab to home back to hospital loop.
Great point and we're on the same page. We've tried and tried and tried. They're stubborn. I believe, subconscious to them, acknowledging the need for a will somehow solidifies their shortening time.

They refuse to think in terms of what we will all have to do after they're gone. Because, in their eyes, they're going to be here for a very long time still. Anyone that's had to work with an elderly person fearing their own mortality can probably understand. It's not us they're arguing with; they're scared, I understand that.

Thanks for the comment.
Yeah, that's also something I'm concerned about. We go through all the war to finally get them the help they need and they just slam the door in the provider's face. I know providers are used to difficult patients but it's still a concern. Thanks for the comment!
I didn't know elder-care lawyers were a thing. That's incredibly helpful. I'm becoming increasingly aware that this is fast becoming legal in nature.

We're currently exploring at-home care but unsure of their willingness to accept it. Cost is an issue as well. And insurance can only be an option with their cooperation. It really does sound like we need to talk with a lawyer.
Something that might get through their skulls is to point-blank tell them that if they won't do it for themselves, why won't they do it to make their daughter's life easier when they're gone?
Good luck.
I learned as I went through something similar with my parents. My father was a very difficult man and both parents refused help.  Dad passed away and now my mom is just as difficult. Long difficult process. Good luck to you.
I'm sorry for your loss and sorry you're still struggling. Do you have any tips or advice? Not emotional, I know that'll be a tough one. I mean like lessons learned or resources used?"

Not sure where you‚Äôre at, but we like brigantine with the kids.   You do have to pay for a tag, but you can usually find parking pretty easily(assuming you‚Äôll be up and early anyhow with a 2 year old) and it‚Äôs either older folks or families.
Seabright, if you can find parking.
Fisherman's Cove in Manasquan was a great place to get our 2 year old in the water the first time without being intimidated by waves.

Walking paths, boats, dogs - a lot of good stuff going on for a toddler.

Asbury park is great and has playgrounds.

Ocean county
Just be prepared for a lot of shells and rocks as you're walking toward the water and getting into the water at the fisherman's cove and if your toddler isn't used to being around dogs it could be overwhelming. When we went with our 2 year old last summer I cut my foot stepping on the high amount of shells (we had water shoes for our toddler) and even though dogs are on leashes an excited golden retriever barking at the same height of a toddlers face can be a bit intimidating. However the boats are a fun thing to point out and it is a very calm water. You are probably looking for more bay beaches rather than the actual ocean beach. Lavalette was enjoyable and LBI had a bay beach with a playground in the sand that our 2 year old had a blast at. If you're concerned about the actual water as in waves I'd recommend the bay over the ocean
Maybe island beach state park? My family liked point pleasant when I was that small
While the ocean is amazing, I definitely recommend some of the bay beaches with little ones. Both Island Heights and Ocean Gate have bay beaches, I believe they aren‚Äôt free though and require badges. The Ocean Gate beach also has a playground I believe? Barnegat Bay beach in Barnegat is free! And in LBI there‚Äôs Bayview Park that also has a playground (unsure if it‚Äôs free). I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs a couple of other free bay beaches in Forked River, but I don‚Äôt know their names!

"Haven't we gotten used to the ""bag ban""?",The bag ban in New Jersey has been in effect for a number of years now. Recently in adverts for the upcoming election certain politicians have been bringing up the bag ban. My question for all of you is haven't we all just gotten used to it?,0.87,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jkos4g/havent_we_gotten_used_to_the_bag_ban/,414,1jkos4g,2025-03-26 22:35,"Most of the time, I don't even carry my reusable bags in to the store. I just throw everything back in the cart and bag it at my car.
My mom told me stories about the Bag Man.
I have about seventeen hundred reusable shopping bags now, so I got that going for me.
I'm sort of used to it but when I'm in PA and get a bag it's a nice surprise. I still HATE the paper straws though.
semi-related but i really miss the grocery baskets that apparently everyone stole out of every store
I have enough reusable bags to insulate my home against a new ice age. None of them are ever in my car when I decide I should stop for groceries. 

I acknowledge that I am the problem in this equation, but also‚Ä¶I am unqualified to fix me.
A lot of places have boxes now like Aldi has always done. I feel like the bag ban is a non-issue but so are a lot of things that gain traction.
I was just talking to my husband about this. I *finally* consistently remember my bags. It‚Äôs not time to reverse this ship. I can handle it now!
I love seeing fewer plastic bags tangled in trees.
Only thing I miss is not being able to use the free plastic shopping bags as trash bags for my bathroom trash can and the recycling bag about half of people have apparently.
I still forget at the grocery store.
Yea using this as a campaign point is very much a ""sir your collar and leash to the oil industry is  showing""
I have a trunk full of reusable bags. There‚Äôs no going back.
Republicans have no actual policies so they have to fabricate grievances that their stupid base can get mad about.
THEY BANNED MUH PLASTIC BAGS SO IM GOING TO VOTE FOR FASCISM TO OWN THE LIBS
It‚Äôs so easy to use reusable bags. We were doing it for years before the ban. Humans were doing it for thousands of years before that.
And the landfills are getting stuffed with bags!
It's so dumb. Every time I get instacart, which is started after having surgery months ago, I get 4 or 5 new bags, so every week. Why can't we have paper bags or boxes. Or a bag exchange. Or let me have plastic bags, which I reuse in my bathroom trash.
it would be nice if they had paper bags available, but i don‚Äôt miss the plastic
I see the bag man in my dreams sometimes
it's the type of shit that appeals to the lowest common denominator.  any politician making a repeal a significant part of their campaign is just trying to lure in idiots who will ignore the rest.
I didn't realize this was a political thing. Seriously? I don't give it a second thought. I have no problem with reusable bags. And should I need a plastic bag for, say garbage or dog poo, I saved all those plastic bags for years....never threw them out. So I have 2 big bags of plastic bags if I need them.¬†
The bag ban is the dumbest thing. You order groceries online or for pickup and still get reusable bags, and end up with hundreds of them that either get trashed or hoarded for future generations to use. Every time you go to a store you are attempted to be upsold to those cloth like bags or the heavy duty plastic ones. 

We can‚Äôt get paper bags anymore? The ban was on plastic, not paper. 

I sound like a boomer now.
I still to this day forget to bring my own bags unless I do order pick up
Probably one the best things for our state. I personally have a shopping cart full of reusable bags. And they're stronger than plastic
Nope. Put it on the ballot and let the voters decide if we want bags
Downvote me but we're all a fuckin bunch of crybabies.

Who gives a shit. Less plastic bags floating all over the streets and getting into the waterways and you're going to complain about it?

Too many reuseable bags? I use them for all sorts of shit and wtf I actually finally mostly remember to take them with me when I go shopping. 9 times out of 10 if you have too many that's your own fucking fault for forgetting them. Donate extras to food banks or something.

Get over it.

And any politician running with this is a fuckin loser and scumball.
I just don't understand why it's so difficult for folks to buy a decent set of reusable bags (I love the Trader Joe's ones), and always keep them in your car. I've been in the habit of grabbing a few every time I go into a store for years now. I rarely forget. Easy peasy. It's not rocket science.
It was an easy adjustment for me, I've been using my own reusable bags for over 10 years
I‚Äôm honestly thrilled with the ban. I was a bit grumpy at first because forgetting my bags was frustrating. I love that I can fit so much more in my own bags and I just feel good about less waste in general.
My biggest anger with the bag ban is how it‚Äôs only a bag ban on customers. Companies are still bagging: bread, sweets, deli meats, fruits and veggies, plastic utensils, and a whole bunch of other bullshit. This ‚Äúbag ban‚Äù only inconvenienced us and did absolutely nothing else (but force me to have to buy actual bathroom trash bags‚Ä¶)
I've been volunteering and active in litter sweeps all around central Jersey for literally 40 years and the difference in the amount of trash on the sides of our roads, on our beaches, in our back bays and along our trails since they implemented the bag and straw bans is nothing short of incredible.
To be honest, no :( 

Every week, I realize I forgot my bags at home when I‚Äôm walking into the store. Story of my life
If you were to peek into my closet, the laundry room, the garage, she'd, backseat of my car, trunk, frunk, door pockets, truck bed, the answer is simply, no. I've literally walked into grocery stores stepping over bags that fell out of my car (putt8ng them back in) forgetting to grab a bag.... it's insanity.

8/10 times I go into the store, I don't remember the bags in my car. 20% of the time, I remember every time.
Yes, I have absolutely gotten used to forgetting my bags in the car EVERY FUCKING TIME.
I still forget my bags like 70% of the time so I have to buy more and now I have a ridiculous amount of bags. Also if I order groceries (new mom this past year, hard to get to the store sometimes) it comes with bags that I have to pay for each time as well. I find it ridiculous why can‚Äôt we just get paper bags.
As a Costco shopper I have been bagless for a long time. I also shop in Pennsylvania sometimes and get bags there. They can come in handy for trash and such.
When I travel I find I confuse cashiers when I say I don't need bags. I really don't miss them.

I especially don't miss them when doing river clean-ups. It felt like 70% of the trash we pulled from the banks were plastic bags.
I have. I take my re-usable bags to the supermarket with me whenever I shop. It‚Äôs no big deal and less waste.
I still forget my bags constantly, but I have gotten used to walking out of a store with a stack of items balanced precariously in my hands. 

It kind of baffles me there's people that still aren't over it. The right or wrong of the thing is irrelevant. We should be able to deal with things much worse than not having plastic bags without it causing upset in our lives. Just my opinion.
I'm so used to it at this point, if I forget a bag, I just buy what I can carry.
It's a way of life now.
I moved to PA recently and the amount of plastic bags they use is insane. I'll have my reusable bag on the counter and they'll still double bag a box of cereal. I didn't realize how used to not seeing plastic bags I was.
Sure don't miss the plastic bags stuck in trees and in the streets.
Yeah now I spend money on bags for my mini trash cans instead of reusing these.
i want my bags. i reused them, used them for other stuff and so forth. honestly banning them and straws was just a feel good measure.. im getting sick of soggy paper straws too
Yes.
The short answer is no. I work at a liquor store with no plastic or paper bags, and three full years later I still have people bitching about the bag ban
Buy a couple of those collapsible crates from Costco for like $8 a piece and just keep them in the trunk. This isn't that hard.
The people who are upset by it also fight for legislation that goes against protecting the planet. Those are also the people who ‚Äúexchange‚Äù a lot of money with the fossil fuel industry. Almost all plastic is created through the fossil fuel industry. The reason for their bitching and complaining makes more sense when you follow the money.
The fact that the rightwing codgers can't find any more recent or more valid issues to use in campaigns or attack adds is kinda hilarious. Is that literally all they have to work with?
Yeah it‚Äôs fine. Remember when it was controversial? Turns out it‚Äôs fine.
I never got used to it.
I want to know why it is always the husbands who haven't gone to a grocery store in decades that complain the loudest. Costco, Aldi, lidl haven't had bags ever.
We purchased and have been using bin boxes before the ban because we hated throwing out those plastic bags weekly.
Yes we have. But this is the kinda dumb shit that winds people up. So politicians run on it positioning it as some sort of government overreach nonsense. It‚Äôs the same reason every presidential election keeps dragging out the same 5 issues. They‚Äôd much rather campaign on the issue than fix it.
I work in New York State, I can get as many disposable bags as I want. Wholesale, even.
I buy new bags every time I go to the store
Yes. I always have reusable bags in the car. I carry them out of the house when I go to the car to replenish my trunk. I also was trying to carry my own bags before the bag ban to reduce plastic and waste. Now I do have a surplus, but I use them for other things. Every state should do it!
I got used to using my own bags during the pandemic, long before the bag ban actually took effect. It was so much better when doing self checkout or just making sure that I didn't have to deal with the bags everyone else had touched, mangled, sneezed on, ripped, etc. And I could get more items (or bigger and heavier ones) into a lesser number of bags.
![gif](giphy|8qJov1TOy2hI4)

Bag Man = the Box Ghost‚Äôs not ghostly and way less scary cousin?
We have 8 rescued cats here at work, I am always looking for plastics bags for litter.
Luckily all the recycled bags I have can hold a (literal) shitload of litter lol
I hate how supermarket cashiers don‚Äôt even bother help you bag items anymore. Even if you buy a bag from them.
No
I used reusable bags before the ban, so it‚Äôs not a huge deal. It‚Äôs nice not seeing them blowing around the streets as much.
Always feel like an AH trying to carry more than 3 things back to my car.  They need to bring back paper bags. Some places have already.
I fucking hate the bag ban with all my heart. I have so many of those stupid fuxks eating space. I loathe it
I donate the mountain of reusable bags I accumulate (especially with like a ShopRite from home order) to the local food pantry that‚Äôs always in need of them.  Solves two problems at once.
Running for office off of lifting the bag ban is pathetic lol. Most Americans are such softies üôÑ
No. I hate the reusable bags. I reused the plastic bags in so many ways, and now that I‚Äôm running out of them, I‚Äôm very unhappy. Plus, the reusable bags have had the opposite effect on what everyone hoped.
Yes we've all gotten used to it, and I actually prefer my fabric and plastic tote bags to the single-use bags. So I don't understand why this is becoming a focus. People are fine with it. The majority of people don't have a problem with this. Can't we move past this and on to things that really matter? I'd also like to add that I was part of Beach cleanups every year and the amount of plastic bags that we would find, including dead wildlife in them was really disheartening. Since the band, we rarely see them. So that's a plus. To me it's seems like it's the Republican candidates and politicians that are addressing this, and it's just such a waste of time at this point.
Yes, gotten used to it.  
But I still collect those bags when out of state for miscellaneous purposes (e.g., dispose of dog waste and garbage left on lawn, cover shoes for packing in luggage, etc)
Doesn't really make sense when surrounding states don't ban.
No. 

It's a tax against poor people.
Yes but that 1/15 times I forget to bring a bag will stick with me way more than the 14 times I remembered. They‚Äôre targeting something that directly affects all voters and convincing people that it‚Äôs a problem worth caring about.
No the bag ban is stupid
I worked for waste management when the ban was being discussed. All of the waste disposal companies lobbied for the ban because China began penalizing loads of recyclables with plastic bags in them. It got to a point companies had to pay to get rid of recyclables compared to making a significant profit from it. During inspection one single bag canceled out 5 cubic yards of recyclables.
I used to live in NY and we got a bag ban way before NJ so I'm kinda just used to it. I got these great reusable bags from Amazon that can rest on top of my cart when I go into the store to bag everything. Got a couple ""cold items"" bags that I use for freezer stuff and produce too. Also as someone mentioned shopping at Costco for a long time you just learn to adapt...
If this is what they think is important, it seems like a red flag..
What would help would be if you could leave your extra reusable bags at the store for other people to reuse
Used to it.  Yes.  Happy with it?   No.  Should have went to biodegradable bags.
I'm still not used to it, and now I have enough reusable bags to start a reusable bag store.
They‚Äôll rally against anything that even appears ‚Äúliberal‚Äù just to garner support from the less educated that the Republican base relies on.
Yep I still mostly forget them in my car. I remember to bring them into Walmart bc I use scan and go. But if I go to the mall and I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm gonna buy anything then I usually forget them in my car and have to buy yet another reusable bag. 

Those plastic grocery bags were never single use for us. We used them for small waste baskets and to clean up pet waste. So now I have to BUY THEM. üò° 

I have a bigger gripe with plastic containers with a ‚Äú5‚Äù on the bottom. Our town only takes #1 and #2 (and glass) for recycling. The 5‚Äôs are containers with snap-on lids like yogurt, sour cream, cottage cheese. I try to reuse them when I can. I do a lot of gardening and some of them are good for planting seedlings (just gotta drill holes in the bottom). Or cut into strips and use as plant tags. 

I almost never put out cardboard for recycling bc it makes an excellent weed barrier in the garden. Use it under mulch. Saves on mulch bc you don‚Äôt have to put the mulch down as deep.
I've gotten used to it. What I hate is that scumbags have stolen all the shopping baskets and I have to use a cart when I just need a few things. (or try and carry all the items to the checkout)
The bad ban is just as dumb now as it was when it was implemented. Any environmental benefits seem to be offset by all the cheap reusable bags people buy at the register then throw away after
I have enough reusable bags to move my entire house in them. I hate it.
No.  Forgot my bags at ShopRite today. 

I used the plastic shopping bags as garbage bags.  Now I have to buy garbage bags, and use more plastic than I was before.
What's a bag
People need something to complain about. Not being able to get a plastic bag to carry their two items to the car is an easy one.
I still hate it. I have ‚Äúreusable‚Äù bags every where, they ones at ShopRite are small and not durable, and I never remember to bring bags in with me.
I miss plastic bags, they were perfect bathroom trash can liners and cat poop bags.
Which politicians are bringing up the bag ban?
Let me see:
 - High taxes
 - Congested roads
 - Over development vs affordable housing
 - Improving NJ Transit 
 - Improving EZ Pass
 - Hardening the infrastructure against 
      natural diasasters
 - Improving failing cities
 - Replacing services the Feds are cutting
 - Corruption
 - Pork Roll vs Taylor Ham
 - Enforcement of passing lane laws
 
And some putz is worried about the bag ban?  WTF is that about?
Honestly who gives a shit? They talk about bag bans because Republicans are one topic voters.
Yes, in fact I learned I much prefer sturdy larger bags than trying to corral 4-5 flimsy plastic bags. On the down side, I used to re-use grocery bags as trash can liners, so now I have to buy those. So that seems like kind of a wash, although honestly I always had an ever-growing stash of bags so maybe there's slightly less plastic leaving my home?

Bro I hate the fucking bag ban!!!!!! Give me bags back!!!!!! I don't want to buy garbage bags anymore. I don't want to buy anymore reusables!!!!
It seems restaurants stopped caring a long time ago
Anyone remember that old Bollywood movie Baghban
The bag ban just meant I have to buy trash bags now; a minor inconvenience. The environment is pretty fucked, but I am buying some eco plastic bags made from plan matter. 

Since assholes litter and don‚Äôt recycle the bags (and recycling them might be bullshit anyway) I‚Äôm fine with the ban.
The real trick is using shallow and wide laundry bins to put your groceries in - it‚Äôs easier to haul into the house, and you‚Äôre not stacking as much on top
Nope, I still forget my reusable ones all the damn time
I relied on the shopping bags as my trash bags for my smaller cans so I miss them lol
There's no good reason to bring back plastic shopping bags, and I will be pissed if they try it.
Dumbest move in our state's history. If someone throws out one reusable bag it costs the equivalent of producing 140 single use plastic bags. If you reused a single use plastic bag once or twice that means 280 to 420 plastic bags equivalent to manufacturing one reusable bag.

We over estimate the intelligence and underestimate the laziness of 90% of humans.
It doesn't matter what the issue is the conservative problem point will always be ""we'll make it the way it used to be""
Both my wife and I have a bag of bags in our trunks so we never forget them. Even if we forget to bring them into a store, we just bag them in the trunk.
Remember coivd. For a republican  the worst thing you can do is mildly inconvenience them.  They voted for a fascist because they were asked to wear a mask for a few months.  Asking them to bring bags to the grocery store might as well be a death threat.
NOOOOOOOO!    I have absolutely NOT gotten used to it.   It's a colossal pain in the butt.  Nothing more than a money grab.    I read that supermarket chains can make an additional 71 million bucks selling bags.   That's a crazy number
Yeah. Grocery stores don't want to buy plastic bags for you. Why would they *buy* grocery bags to give you when they can charge you a dollar for one of theirs? Good luck with that.
I moved to NJ from Texas over 6 months ago. Texas is SO obsessed with their plastic Walmart bags, they‚Äôre used for everything from waterproofing shoes and socks to bagging pet waste to using in small trash cans to portioning and packaging food at home, the list goes on. They‚Äôre all over the place outside, all along the sides of the highways, in our lakes and rivers, beaches, camp sites, parks.

I don‚Äôt miss them in the slightest, and anyone who wants to try to bring that dystopian bullshit back is insane to an ignorant degree, or ignorant to an insane degree. Either/or ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The bag man of Chernarus?
I still have enough irate customers lately to say no, absolutely not. Some of them seem to be confusing the plastic straw thing with plastic bags.
Best case I only get 10 steps away from the car before I realize I forgot my bags.
I‚Äôm definitely already used to forgetting my bags at home and trying to carry all of my groceries in my house with two arms. I‚Äôm not even mad about the ban anymore, at this point I‚Äôm just mad at myself.
I‚Äôm sort of use to it, I just use my Disney tote bag I got a while to carry groceries. But usually will bring the cart all the way to the car to just throw it in the backseat or trunk. I forget my re-useable bags sometimes.
I have 20 reusable bags, some in the car, those get filled, the previous ones are ready to grab next trip to the car. 

I love not having plastic bags rip apart and the extra trips to carry everything in.
I think most of us have. I don't leave home for groceries without a bag in hand. And I keep a few spare ones in my car. So it's hardly an issue anymore. At the same thing I think we've all been caught in moments where we do have to pay a few cents more for the bag however. And we all have more reusable bags than what we probably need haha
The easiest solution was allowing stores to provide plastic bags for free\cost, with an additional surcharge of maybe 10 or 20 cents per bag.

It would allow people to avoid having to buy reusable bags if they forgot or didn't expect to need them, and in smaller numbers those bags almost always were multi-use. (small trash can liners, picking up after the dog, etc). Instead, i end up buying single use bags now for those tasks.

Basically just a little balance. 

But i really don't think its an important issue to be worried about right now, and if it moves any voters, well, those voters are fucking idiots and could have been swayed by pretty much anything.
I've gotten used to it even though I occasionally forget. No real biggy, I can deal with it. Plus with possible lumber tariffs in Canada paper products prices might be going up anyways.
I‚Äôm used to it. It would be a shame if it was reversed. I also think reusables cost at least $5 since they‚Äôre also becoming a problem.¬†
I‚Äôm from Utah and I‚Äôm trying but I ALWAYS FORGET.
It‚Äôs probably not been great for some businesses.

I‚Äôll be honest: I sometimes just order online because I don‚Äôt have a bag on me and just say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù vs walk into the store.  I know other people do this too.

That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, employees at a warehouse and delivery folks are still getting work, it‚Äôs not bad for workers, but it‚Äôs bad for local businesses that need to abide by the rules.
I work as a cashier and people still forget their bags all the time so I would say no
Still incredibly stupid. Ban plastic bags, just for everyone to buy one-use felt bags. 

Everyone in this thread can say ‚ÄúI save my bags in the car!!‚Äù 

But every time we go to the store we see the old fucks carry their shit in the felt bags or the plastic bags

Policy that meant well, but the negative externalities was more felt bags bought by seniors.
It took a while for me to fully adjust but tbh if bags were brought back, I‚Äôd probably still use my reusable ones out of habit. I don‚Äôt like change ü§£
I have a bunch...they are somewhere in the garage though.
I dunno, people still keep stealing baskets from Shoprite.
![gif](giphy|dlLsUqxpRb4MU)
Definitely used to it! The morning guy on NJ 101.5 keeps trying to argue that plastic bags are more reusable bc people will use them for dog walks, bathroom garbage bins, etc. and I get that, but to argue that those are more reusable than‚Ä¶ you know, reusable bags, is nonsense. 

I use my reusable bags not just for groceries, but if I‚Äôm bringing stuff to someone‚Äôs house, to send something into my kids school if needed, etc. 

Definitely used to it and I don‚Äôt see why people are still making such a big deal out of this.
Even if you forget your bag, just look around the bushes or outskirts of the stores.  There is usually a new clean one that blew away hanging out somewhere.  I see these bags daily on the side of the road.
Five Below sells some really good reusable bags.  They are huge, almost like a beach bag and they are only 99 cents.  I can practically fit an entire cart of groceries into 1 or 2 bags.
Deep Blue States/Districts means that conservative dipshit politicians like Josh Gottheimer run as Democrat.
Honestly I haven‚Äôt thought about this bag ban because it doesn‚Äôt annoy me. Though it does remind me of the skit on Portlandia which makes me laugh.
WHO GIVES A FK ABOUT THE BAG BAN?! Such a dumb topic, it was annoying at first but everyone has gotten over it and used to it. Fkn govt is falling apart and people are talking about plastic bags?!
I‚Äôve seen a lot of those adverts but haven‚Äôt seen any of them bringing up the bag ban. Are some politicians talking about bringing plastic bags back? I loved reusing plastic bags as mini trash can liners, but bringing a tote bag is second nature to me. 

I know you can buy paper bags at some stores for a few cents, but if some politicians want to bring back bags, then I think we should go back to paper bags. Or ignore the bag thing all together and focus on real issues.
The only thing I hate about the bag ban is that most of the grocery stores near me got rid of the little baskets. People kept taking them home because they forgot a bag or were anti-ban and decided that was how they should deal with it. The baskets are $30 a pop (according to someone I know who works at the local grocery store I go to) so they eventually just stopped replacing them. It's annoying when youre shopping for one or two people
I just came home from shopping this morning, and I have plastic carry bags in my car.  When I leave the store, I will put the item in the bag at the car. It's easier toting all of my goods in carry bags, and you can put more stuff in these heavy duty bags than a regular store plastic bag. And no need for double bags either.  After unloading, I take the bags back to the car when I'm ready to use the car again.   I've gotten used to the bag ban.

BTW:  I used to use the supermarket bags for the waste baskets.  Now I have to get dedicated trash bags.  So I'm mixed on this.
i really do not care to be honest. if anything, i‚Äôm for it because it helps to make steps towards bettering the environment. usually we just bring the cart to our car, throw everything in the back, and bring everything in w/o bags. or, we have reusable bags we use. we also use the cardboard boxes at costco
Yea I'm used to it and love it, but you forget there's a lot of weak, miserable civilians in this country.
For me it is not having those plastic bags hanging from high up in my beautiful trees.
Assemblyman John Azzariti, Jr.  in District 39 has [introduced a bill to kill the bag ban](https://www.insidernj.com/nj-republican-proposes-repealing-states-ban-on-plastic-bags-straws/).  Playing to his right wing snowflake supporters.

His fellow district 39 Assemblyman Bob Auth introduced a bill to pull NJ out of the Insterstate Compact (which commits NJ to give electoral votes to whoever wins popular vote across all Interstate Compact members).  He claims the electoral college better reflects the will of the people.  What a tool.
Only in nj would the contrive something so
Idiotic. No paper bags ONLY plastic avail and u have to pay for it. When you order from
Walmart its like they pack each and every item in its own stupid plastic
Non recyclable
Bag. It‚Äôs so clearly some kinda scheme especially moving back here from other states who‚Äôd outlawed plastic bags years ago yet their system works-in sharp contrast to NJ LOL. What us wrong w paper bags? Why is nj so anti environmental
Stewardship? Nj always has to do THE MOST when ca or ny roll something out but there is always some kinda bullshit like this attached.
As someone who gets their groceries delivered, I have entirely too many reusable shopping bags. Fortunately I found a food pantry in my town that accepts them as donations.
I travel between Jersey and Georgia and half the time I keep forgetting that we‚Äôre the only ones with bags bans here. The only thing that I miss about bags is that I never had to order them for my bathroom trash bags because I could go to ShopRite or Target and grab a handful lol. Now I gotta use my mother‚Äôs secret plastic stash lmao.
They aren't selling me on it. I'm fine with reusables, or bagging at the trunk
No
I mean sometimes yeah I forget to put the bags back in the car. I do wish they'd allow purchase of paper bags but someone running on this as part of a campaign is dumb.
I forgot that happened. I just kinda substituted the reusable ones in the plastic one's place
I hate the bag ban every time I go to the grocery store, and every time I walk park trails or sidewalks...  
  
However, Costco trained me for many years before the ban, so I never had much problem tossing loose groceries in my car.
Less litter since the ban.
When I go to PA, they don't have a bag ban. It's a stupid decision to have that. Back in the day we all use to take our groceries and not worry about forgetting your bags in the car or somewhere.
Grandma cart go brrr
I thought we all where keeping resuable bags in our trunks, My car also came with a little storage divider so that's also what I use
Absolutely not...
yeah for the most part , its just normal to us now.
I still regularly forget bags when I go into stores üòÇ
Just for the record. When I suggested the Costco method of grocery bagging at the trunk instead of the cash register to save time and not hold up your neighbors in line about a year ago, I was downvoted into Hell.
How about banning corporations from wasting tons of plastic and cardboard on oversized packaging, that also means more truckloads because of wasted space. 

Stop putting all the onus on the little guy. Yea I forget bags all the time. Amazingly out of all the things in my life making sure I have 10 bags in my car at all times has not moved to the top of the list.
Problem is the bag ban has been pretty negative on the environment and its an inconvenience to consumers. I still find a bunch of reusable bags in parking lots and stuff them into my car. I'd love to reverse it.
I work at Rite Aid; EVERYONE asks for a damn bag. It's crazy, we did have these paper bags for a few months but we're not even getting those in anymore. And they're obviously mad at a cashier about it üòÇ
I think the ban has been great. I think people still can't wrap their heads around it though. I bought a collapsible grocery tote that sits in my trunk - don't bother bagging groceries in the store, just pack them into the tote when I get back to my car. A a bonus it's very easy to carry all my groceries into the house in one trip!
OK- but hear me out. I'm carrying all me items to my car in a sling I've made from gathering the front of my shirt, while these assholes are cutting down national forest and making it legal to dump chemicals and sewage into drinking water. Make it Make Sense.
 My bathroom trash bags are now Walmart fabric bags... still disposable to me, I have approx 6533467
i love my collection of reusable bags. ive always had them before the ban but even more of a reason to use them now
Im all for the bag ban, ive gotten used to having a bag with a few bags inside my car at all times. That being said, i knkw we all HATE the PAPER STRAWS!!! I love the turtles but fuck me its impossible to snjoy a drink when the straw gets soggy. You can say goldbye to enjoying anything like a Frostie or milkshake with those dang paper straws... Id rather be offered a $1 upcharge or something for a metal straw or bamboo straw i can keep and use at home after.
Getting used to it and thinking it‚Äôs a good idea for the environment are two different things. I didn‚Äôt need to get used to it because I had a few bags I used anyway - one was a big cooler bag I got from BJs.

Anyway, because of the ill effects from it, I don‚Äôt think the Murphy admin thought it through enough.
I worked at a dollar store and because people neglected to bring their bags and we didn't sell any people were taking the shopping hand baskets to their cars and never returning them so we stopped having the privilege of having those handheld baskets the carts could not be taken  out of the store bc of poles that wouldn't fit through the door
The lines were backed up at the register mostly 20 people each had 12 items people were rude to me as the cashier when it wasn't even my fault they didn't bring bags or boxes it was horrific
I brought reusable bags to the store way before they banned the bags, so for me it's never been an issue.
I‚Äôve gotten used to it. Seems pointless to go back.
I'm used to it. I haven't heard anyone complaining in a long time. It seems simple to me, just bring your reuseable bags with you.
Maga can‚Äôt bother to change for the betterment of society so they‚Äôll never get used to it.  We should send the nations used plastic bags to wildwood and they can use them as diapers at their rallies.
I order from Snake RIver Farms because they send these amazing, and really high quality insulated bags that my wife loves for cold items on shopping trips. I get a really nice steak in exchange so, hey, win-win.
I now own two reusable bags that I clip on my handbag and fill in the store. When it‚Äôs full, I‚Äôm done shopping. 

I live alone, so I know I am not the norm.
Still, I have a bunch of bags in the trunk and can just load them up from the cart after purchase.

And I shop at Costco for bulk items, they never had bags. Don‚Äôt see their sales ebbing anytime soon‚Ä¶
Plastic bags are why Pennsylvania exists.  And grocery carts for when you forgot to bring your bag.
I've been living off reusing  year old plastic bags from Trader Joe's and Weis, but they are starting to fail.
I still forget sometimes but honestly I do not care. Like I can‚Äôt imagine having plastic all over the place again. Having totes to load up for the beach or haul extra stuff when I‚Äôm going somewhere has been so useful. My family reused plastic anyway, these are just way sturdier so they‚Äôre more versatile.
Yes I am used to it so much that when I shop in DE and PA, I still bring my own bag!
Never gonna let it go.  We need plastic straws and plastic bags or we don't have freedom.
No, it was stupid to get rid of the alleged ‚Äúsingle use‚Äù plastic bags. I used them for so much! Bring them back! All this did was create more waste and give retailers the initiative to charge for the bags to bring out groceries home. Even if they bring plastic bags back I would be surprised if they tacked on a bag charge.
Lmao no. I still have customers bitching and moaning about it every day. ""I'm NoT gIvInG mUrPhY aNy MoNeY.""
Honestly what frustrates me is that paper was banned too. Give me the paper bag option. But no, now I have a bunch of bags in my trunk which looks like crap, I have to remember and preplan every shopping trip and when the raw chicken leaks I basically throw that reusable bag away. The checkout people don‚Äôt give you enough time to bag, and the bag people no longer exist, so you feel like Lucille Ball and the chocolate factory trying to get out of the grocery store. 
I do need to try to do this the European way, which is just to put the items in the cart and then bag it in the parking lot behind my car. That‚Äôs just not the American way.
 And if it‚Äôs not a grocery store, you may not even have a cart that you can take to your car. 
It really frustrates me.  I call them ‚ÄúMurphy Bags‚Äù since this is all his fault. It is a total peeve of mine. And yes I am old and grumpy. lol.

Edited to add : and what do the poor school children do to cover their books now without the paper shopping bag? Lol.

And yes, the bag man is still in office and no I‚Äôm not used to him yet.
Sometimes I‚Äôll be in pa and the cashier will bag up all my items and I‚Äôll walk outta there feeling like a very special queen.
Nope lol. We want bags back. This is stupid.
It's a dog whistle. Anyone who says they hate it is a TRUMPER. The constant lying really worked on them. And consequently all of us. Just like vaccinations,etc etc etc.
It‚Äôs been two years‚Ä¶I haven‚Äôt gotten used to it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs one of those things that you don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre taking for granted until it‚Äôs gone‚Ä¶I have to now travel to PA to get some shopping done‚Ä¶
It was never more than a mere inconvenience and I vastly prefer not having to deal with the wasteful trash. 

I stole a basket from my local kings and keep it in my trunk as my grocery transporter along with a few reusable bags. EZ
It's low hanging fruit to appeal to voters who hate any type of change and refuse to adapt out of stubbornness.
I have gotten a collapsible, Velcro box that divides and holds my groceries. Fuck bags; plastic, paper, reusable are all bad for the planet
I would be inclined to become a single issue voter to reverse the bag ban
I have
I'm used to it. It kind of throws me when I'm in the South and they give me like five plastic bags for a small cart of groceries.
The Bag Man
Used to it, sure. Like it? No. A lot of times I order groceries because I work strange hours. Each order gets a fresh set of bags. My kitchen is full of bags! They‚Äôre like frickin tribbles but non-fuzzy!
i mean, I still have tons of reusables I get from delivery that go in the garbage periodically

let's not pretend the law couldn't be improved, delivery reusable is so dumb
no
Nope. Hate it
People still act surprised when we can't give them a bag. Fucking idiots.
Love the bag ban!!! Feel it‚Äôs fantastic and any one opposed is just low IQ. As if we need more idiots in the world
I keep a laundry basket in my trunk, fill it up from the cart.
The Costco way.
Samesies. I usually forget to bring them into the store, if I even remembered to bring them into the car. No big, it all gets home the same.  Totally worth it to not have all those plastic bags blowing down the streets.
I actually like it better. The bags are stronger and I can carry more. And I don't have hundreds of bags in my house now that I have to recycle. Even if they went back I would use my own bags
I forget my collection of 100 bags every trip. I just bring it to my car then place it in my trunk organizer. Then like a ditz I carry items to my house bear hug style until I realize I should go get bags from inside my house to bag it then
That is how I shop. If I‚Äôm going in for only a few items I have a bag I can ball up in my pocket that I will bring in. Otherwise everything goes back in the cart and I bag it in the car where I can take my time and separate things by where they go in my house. Doing it this way also gets rid of the anxiety and rush that I‚Äôm holding up the next person as I try to finish bagging.
I love doing this. It makes checkout traffic go so much faster.
I'd recommend getting one of those bags that folds up into itself real small so you can carry it on a keychain or purse. 

Here's what the Trader Joe's looks like.

https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/mini-canvas-tote-bag-076747
Stop n shop has the scanner at the entrance where you scan and bag as you shop. Checkout is a breeze, just hand the scanner to cashier and pay, put bags in the car. 

Saves me so much time.
Same. I still have plastic produce bags to use for cat litter so I'm not missing anything.
It's brilliant that the giant basket that you've just carried everything around the store in can also carry everything to the car. üí°
My hack. If I'm in a real bind. I'll take an extra plastic bag from the produce aisle and use that
This is what I do so I can get in and out of the store asap.
In the winter even?? I had to do that twice this winter and my hands were numb by the time I was done.
Same but mostly cause I keep forgetting to grab the bag from the car or I buy more than the amount of bags I remembered to grab
I need to start doing this. I always feel this rush to bag my stuff as fast as possible in the store and then I end up with two 50lb bags and two half pound bags of stuff
This is the way
It's the Aldi way. What's annoying is if you ever do grocery delivery because they'll inevitably drop a bunch of reusable bags you don't need with stickers all over them.
That‚Äôs what I use to tell people when I worked at Aldi BEFORE the bag ban. Everyone looked at me like I can do that?!
I have had [these](https://www.chicobag.com/shop/original-repete-refine-297) ChicoBag shopping bags for 20 years after getting them for free as promotional gear. 

They are made out of a parachute-type fabric, pack down to the size of a potato, carry 25+ lbs., and have not ripped on me. Super easy to tuck into a purse or pocket and clip them together for a shopping trip. 

Definitely stresses me out less than other reusable bags which look like a pile of dirty laundry when there are a bunch of them stacked together. They also have the benefit of making you look like a magician at the checkout area when you unpack the bag from its lil attached pouch. 

""Made from GRS certified, 100% post consumer recycled plastic bottles and solution (waterless) dyed, resulting in 90% less water, 63% less CO2, and 60% less energy.""
Same, but not on purpose.  I forget them.  Every.  Single. Time.
Heard
Stranger danger!
He and the Jersey Devil have been terrorizing every strip mall in the Pine Barrens for centuries
I heard he walks like a chicken
Same, but not a single one ever lives in the trunk of my car when I need it‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve gotten embarrassingly comfortable with carrying an armful of unbagged groceries out to my car
I can't pass up a new one either. I'll get a free one in the mail or something and I'm like ""oh wow a new bag"" and now I have seventeen hundred and one.
Same here.  I get a new set every time I order groceries.
I donated a lot to a food pantry. You could do it as well if it's a burden.
![gif](giphy|11sz4838afILLi|downsized)
Stash them in your car. Literally leave them in a pile by your front door so next time you leave you bring them.
Same here, but never in my car where I need them.
when I die, on my deathbed, I will receive total consciousness, you want to trade?
You can donate them to food banks if you want to get rid of some of them.
That‚Äôs also your fault though
I had a couple hundred, but gave most to a local food bank last summer.
And they all get forgotten at home when I grocery shop
Should've started with ""I don't mean to brag, but...""
I stopped using straws entirely because I don‚Äôt like paper straws. The only thing I still use straws for are milkshakes and inevitably the straw melts and collapses before I can finish it. I appreciate the places that use waxed straws so they won‚Äôt melt, although they probably also don‚Äôt biodegrade either defeating the purpose.
i have a sensory issue with anything paper or cotton in/on my mouth, and the way those damn dry straws get stuck to my lips makes me feel murderous.  i have a bag of bendy plastic straws in my car that i was using until the guilt got to me...i now begrudgingly suffer the unpleasantness, and release my frustrations by yelling at some plants that i'm doing it for them.  i don't think they care much.

we have silicone reusable ones in the house but if i tried that in the car, my ADHD ""out of sight, out of mind"" default would lead to a pile of gross moldy straws that would just end up getting thrown out anyway.  why does everything that makes life manageable when your brain is running 432 tabs at once end up being environmentally shitty?
Finally a fellow paper straw hater
It's so weird when I go to Wawa, they have lids that don't need straws (sippy cup style) and they still ask if I need a straw.
same. I ask for plastic straws everywhere I go. sometimes I‚Äôll get an extra, or if I go home I decide to not use a straw and I have a little stock pile. I don‚Äôt know why more places don‚Äôt use the biodegradable straws that are similar to plastic. imo that was the solution all along. chick fil a (at least the one near me) now uses them exclusively. it was a great change
Same. I‚Äôd rather have plastic straws back and keep the bag ban lol
We bought a gigantic box of plastic straws so now we generate extra trash by throwing out the paper ones and using our plastic ones which then also get tossed.
I was wondering why there weren‚Äôt baskets anymore! When I‚Äôm going for a quick trip and don‚Äôt need an entire cart, it‚Äôs ridiculous I can‚Äôt use a basket instead. And apparently putting your items directly into your reusable shopping bag is frowned upon because you could be perceived as stealing. A-holes ruining things for the rest of us. üòí
If it's a decent store they will replace the baskets and still have them. My local ShopRite told me that they gave up because people kept stealing them and it‚Äôs one of the reasons I no longer shop there.
Theft is definitely a factor but people with shopping baskets buy less than those with carts even when they come in for the same things.
By boxes, you mean free cat beds.
Distractions
Like canadian fentanyl?
This right here! The decrease of bags in trees is amazing
Yeah, there‚Äôs a noticeable difference. Nice to see.
There was one tangled in my kindling pile in my back yard the other day and all I could think while I was pulling it out was ‚Äúwhere did this come from?!?‚Äù
And fewer floating in a stream. Or stuck in a storm drain. Or blowing all over during recycle day because people don't understand a) those bags aren't recyclable, and b) how to put out light stuff on a windy day with wind protection or a weight on top
some day, kids will watch american beauty and have no idea what that ghostly floating thing is in the video.
My daughter calls them Jersey Jellyfish ü™º
I still see many on the side of the road.  And every reusable bag is equal to 125 single use ones.  

I haven't bought a single one and all my bags were either freebies or found discarded and cleaned by me.
I just get 3-4 gallon trash bags for this. Biggest thing I miss is the cashiers actually bagging the groceries for you without having to ask and awkwardly handing them an assortment of reusable bags. The line takes so much longer when people have to pay and bag their own groceries.
 I‚Äôm a teacher who used the plastic bags constantly for sending wet clothes home in backpacks. I cannot tell you how much I miss them just for this specific purpose.
You can actually buy them in bulk. I got 1,000 bags for about $15 a few years ago and still have a bunch. I use them for liners and for cat litter, with 3 cats they get heavy use.
Same. We have to now buy bags to use which makes it a one time use bag. Before, it was use the bag to bring home items, then use the bag to store decor, damp dirty clothes from the gym, etc and then become a bathroom trash bag just before it was about to develop a hole. 

Yes, we have a small stash of bags, but we prefer to hoard them rather than wasye them as trash bags only.

It's a love/hate thing, I guess.
Do you not but vegetables or fruit? You get plastic bags with those.
Me too.  But that‚Äôs my problem and there are plenty of solutions out there. Not worth repealing the bag ban just because some of us are absent minded.
Just stop bagging in the store. Put your stuff back in the cart and then bag it at your car. After you unload at your house stuff all the bags into one and hang it on your door knob. Next time you leave the house the bags are right there where you can‚Äôt miss them and you can put them in the car so they are ready for the next time.
Ask for a box. Grocery stores unpack and break down hundreds of boxes every day. Whenever I forget a bag I just ask for one.
I don't know for sure, but I think all those reusable bags made of woven plastic are netting more profits for the oil industry. Or at least it must be pretty close, because while there might not be as many, they are much heavier.
Yep. Out of all the things wrong in our world, I don‚Äôt feel like this needs to be a key issue.
This is what I am seeing. Lots of manufactured outrage over some supper petty stuff.
No they have plenty of policies. All of them are anti-american and more importantly, anti-common man.

They just spew this garbage so you don't notice it. Why would they speak their evil plans out loud? Are they bond villains?
Ironically super MAGA Saker lobbied for the bag ban
Bingo! This is just a distraction.
This feels like the answer.  You can't talk about the cost of groceries because... omg, bags!?!
Yes, and they‚Äôve already used up the drag queens, trans bathrooms, and there are no new vaccines to be mad about. They‚Äôre really scraping the bottom of the outrage barrel with the bag ban.
the policies are to grift as much money as they can from the citizens. And it's working.
They don't want to govern, they want to rule.
I'm not defending anything, but some additional insight. I think it's more about the accumulation of less convenience and more cost across the board that people are pissed about. Now we don't have bags for convenience and food prices didn't go down, so now we're paying more and getting less goods and less convenience and more profits for the Grocer.
I‚Äôve been reusing some bags for 20+ years. (They don‚Äôt make em like they used to!)
The supermarkets in NJ lobbied to have paper bags banned as well, to push that cost onto the consumer. Most other places with plastic bag bans specifically allow paper bags, because paper is recyclable and plastic bags are not. Now stores get to sell you a bag that uses more plastic. Ironically those POS (point of sale) bags are essentially disposable, because they are POS (pieces of shit) with poor gusseting and an odd shape compared to the usual rectangular reusable bags.
Is there no system for the store to take them back for them to be reused for online orders?
my bags o' plastic bags were gone within months...thanks, cats.  they poop a lot.
Having you heard. Reusable bags are woke.
I just have my kids trained to bring their disposable bags when they visit from out of state.
Paper was included when the law rolled out. The supermarkets in NJ lobbied to have paper bags banned as well, to push all their bagging costs onto the consumer, plus make some profit on selling bags. Most other places with plastic bag bans specifically allow paper bags, because paper is recyclable and plastic bags are not. Now stores get to sell you a bag that uses more plastic.
Yeah this is my biggest gripe.

Shoprite doesn't give you the option to decline for pick up and delivery so you have to pay the bag fee regardless. And if you select ""no bags"" at Walmart - it's a toss up whether they listen or not.

Shoprite supposedly ""recycles"" them but I'd love to know what that process looks like and how good it is for the environment.
Leave them in the car instead of the house. Problem solved.
I‚Äôll admit that I‚Äôm terrible at putting the bags back in the car, and sometimes even remembering to bring them into the store with me! But that‚Äôs a me problem.  Certainly not worth all the plastic bags we used to have blowing down the streets, tangled in trees, and floating in the water.
I collect fun ones. When I go somewhere that has custom interesting ones I‚Äôll often get one. My most recent additions are from a trip to The Netherlands where I got two from a big grocery chain there ‚ÄúJumbo‚Äù and one made of woven hemp from a cheese store. While the ‚ÄúJumbo‚Äù branded ones are like having a ShopRite branded one here, no one here has them which makes them fun to me. 

If people hadn‚Äôt resisted reusable bags in the beginning it was trivial to get them for free. Everyone used to give them out as promotions. That‚Äôs actually why I now collect interesting ones because my whole collection was made up of different free promotional bags. My ‚Äúsquishy‚Äù bag that I can ball up small and fit in my pocket was a free promo from my vet.
This is what I love. People forget that those plastic bags were small and very thin. Often times broke before getting back to the car.
I use bread bags and produce bags for my bathroom garbage can. I just shake out crumbs. I still haven‚Äôt bought any liners.
Put the stuff back in your cart and pack bags at the car. Then you never have to remember to bring bags in. I started doing that ages ago and it is so much easier.
This is true for me as well. I order groceries for my elderly mother (she doesn‚Äôt like to drive), and she has a glut of reusable bags from the deliveries. Talk about wasteful
you would think.  apparently dumb shit like shopping bags are infinitely more important to some people than things like climate change, access to healthcare, civil rights, etc.  why dwell on something difficult and deeply unpleasant when you can focus irrational amounts of rage onto trivialities?

we're living in an age of ""la-la-la i can't hear you so you must not be talking!""  nothing quite like the power of denial.
My parents bring me up tons of plastic bags when they visit. My dad said he feel like he‚Äôs smuggling something lmao. But I use the plastic bags for so many things. I never realized until we didn‚Äôt have them anymore.
The GOP is exceptionally good at distracting the public from the real issues.
Yes! There was an interview on 101.5 today and every person who wanted bags back in the stores were husbands. Y'all need to train your men better üòâ
Why should they?
It‚Äôs almost like you could just remember to bring the bags you already own with you to the store so you don‚Äôt accumulate more and just use the ones you have ü§î
How‚Äôs that?
What is making you use more plastic?
But those plastic bags at ShopRite were super thin and broke every time.
The trick is to stop bagging in the store. Just put items back in your cart and bag at the car. That way you never have to remember to carry the bags in with you or worry if you have too many or too few. It would even eliminate your need to remember to stuff plastic bags into your pocket.
but it‚Äôs much better not having plastic bags flying all over the damn place
Also why should the store supply you with bags for free?
It humors me that the Chinese place I go to still uses plastic bags around paper bags. I can‚Äôt decide if they don‚Äôt care about the ban or bought so many plastic bags in bulk that they are still working thru their supply. And I‚Äôve never understood why they put a plastic bag around a paper bag in the first place. It‚Äôs like they want to be as wasteful with bags as possible. Just pick one.
But like....don't buy anymore. I don't understand this. Most stores were giving reusable bags when the ban started
i'd be okay with it if they invested in compostable bags across the board - producing them at high volume would bring the cost down, even then i'd be fine paying 5 or 10¬¢ a bag.  seems like that would be a win-win for a lot of people.
Almost as bad as Jeff Van Drew. I hope he is not the dem nominee for governor....
I assume you‚Äôre right on the border, otherwise you are just making like hard on yourself to prove a point to‚Ä¶ yourself.
Oh please
You go all the way to pa, because you can't get plastic bags?
It's actually been 3 years but you know who's counting
What a very small mind you have.
that‚Äôs a crazy take
New Jersey implemented a ban on single-use plastic bags in 2022‚Äìthe strictest ban on bags in the nation at the time, supposedly to cut back on plastic bags piling up in landfills.¬†Plastic consumption in New Jersey¬†spiked by nearly three times increasing greenhouse gas emissions from the use of bags by 500 percent following the state‚Äôs implementation of the ban.¬†New Jersey also banned paper bags making grocery store patrons use reusable totes instead. Shop owners profited from the sale of the reusable bags that were used only 2 or 3 times before being misplaced or disposed of. New Jersey‚Äôs plastic bag ban misfired and similar to other green initiatives, no serious cost-benefit analysis was conducted before implementing the ban. This should be a word of caution to policy makers that their forced and rapid push to supposedly environmentally green initiatives does not always get the intended result, and in fact, can result in opposite outcomes, as is the case with grimy reusable food bags.
That's a good idea
Ooooooo-ooh ... next level. 

Stealing.


edit: stealing the life hack; not an accusation at the commentator lol üôÉ
Me too :)  i keep it in the cart and fill it up with frozen and non refrigerated items after they're scanned. And then put an insulated bag in the child seat of the cart for refrigerated stuff and a second one in the cart as well if needed
I have hard sided collapsible storage bins. Stiff and strong when needed, but fold almost entirely flat when I don't. Costco sells them as a 4 pack.
My friend takes the basket into the store and fills it up.
Yup, I have a sinilar setup, but its a few year old medium sized heavy duty cardboard box.
genius‚Ä¶.
....and hanging off tree branches!
Same.
that's why i keep 3 or 4 separate bags o' bags in my car.  i will generally have at least one back there by the time the pile inside my house by my back door grows large enough that i can't ignore it any longer and they find their way back home to the car.

of course my ADHD brain uses a whole separate bag o' bags system for ""organizing"" the various piles of crap in the house, which just means there are even more bags full of random stuff in weird places.  anyone else have a reusable bag ""filling system""?
Just started doing it this way too and it's so freeing.
I make it a game of beating the cashier to bag my groceries while they're scanning, pay before they're done and drop the cart at the main corral on my way out.
I love that option at Stop & Shop!
Lol same. I go bagging each individual veggie and things so I have plenty for the cats xD and the groceries just get loaded right from the cart into easy to carry bins. I have some sturdy reusable bags in there too and one in the purse for small trips.
Yes! I use those as my mini trash liners
I got a litter genie. Wow so nice. No stink either.
Check out gloves and mittens!
But he quacks like a duck!
Exactly.¬†
I had this problem too! And it would piss me off so much when people would be like ""oh just keep them in your car!"" 

If my brain worked that way I fucking would!!

But anyway now, if I remember to bring bags, I'll bring like 2 or 3 extra and just leave them in the car if I don't use them. That way for WHEN I forget in the future there's a chance I have a loose bag floating around somewhere.
I'm waiting for the new fashion made of unused bags, or an art exhibit purely with all the extras people have.
Donate any excess to a local food pantry!! They‚Äôll gladly take them and use them for food distribution to those who need it!
Yeah what am I supposed to do with them? Seems too wasteful to just throw away but they are slowly taking over the house‚Ä¶.
The store will take them back if they are clean. I do pickup so when the guy came out to the car I said, here's 50 bags you can have, and he took them.
I volunteer at a food pantry, and the bags are only good for them if they are in pristine condition, and able to be neatly folded. Otherwise, you are just giving the food pantry the additional job of trying to offload/dispose of all your old crumply crinkly bags.
I have big thick metal straws in a bag in my car specifically for milkshakes. I obviously take them inside to wash and then take them to use the next time. But they‚Äôre ever better than the plastic imo.
Biodegradeable plastic straws are a thing! You could get a pack of those. [Example](https://www.phadeproducts.com/products/7-75-jumbo-wrapped-eco-straws-100-count-two-boxes/)

>why does everything that makes life manageable when your brain is running 432 tabs at once end up being environmentally shitty?

I have ADHD and relate. I have found, however, that there often are environmentally friendly alternatives if you go out of your way to look for them  - they just unfortunately come at a premium price compared to the environmentally shitty ones. But for something really important to you, it can be worth it
You might try getting industrially compostable straws. Get the ones that have a T√ºv or BPI rating on them. They're basically identical to the plastic ones because they are made out of corn. They don't fall apart quite as easily as the paper ones, but they both break down in soil.
Yes!! They do this to me at Starbucks as well.
I still get the straws ü§£
that‚Äôs how i feel! i should have put my former comment in quotations, because that‚Äôs what the store employees have told me at multiple stores. i feel like replenishing baskets is just a business cost that needs to be absorbed.¬†

yes amazon sells em.  i dont mind the reusable bags as much as i thought i would.  but i still buy the bulk bags for my dog.  shes 85 lbs and her 'business' aint small a bit too big for the dog waste bags in petco etc...
Good ideas,  I don't have a car though so the ban has always been a bit more difficult for pedestrians
My wife and I just use whatever store were going toos mobile app and scanned and bag directly into the shopping cart. Then, just use the self checkout. It's great everything gets bagged while we're shopping and we're gone.
Those technically count as bags, and they aren‚Äôt supposed to be doing that without charging a fee.
I don't know their politics, but disposable bags are no longer part of their budget.
And that's why I no longer shop at Shoprite
DON'T FORGET THE STRAWS!!!1!1!
The reusable bags we got were 99c and we got them like 4 years ago.
It isn't ""insightful"" to complain that paying for your own bags is a minor expense & a minor inconvenience.

Its petty. Its a little bit trashy - pun intended - but it isn't insightful.
The bags that my Shop Rite sells are actually really good.  They are about twice the size of a typical plastic bag so I can fit my entire cart of groceries into about 3 or 4 bags.  I find them to be very good quality and you can buy 5 for $3.
No, there is not. I tried leaving them out to give to instacart shoppers for free, but they understandably refuse to take them as well.
ü§£
Not only are you paying the cost of the bags, but you're also paying to advertise their business with no real choice in the matter. It's funny people have no idea that supermarkets lobbied for this for very obvious reasons and none of them were the environment.
Bingo. It‚Äôs terrible, at least you could use plastic bags to throw out trash before they ended in a dumpster. Bow we have people with 100s of reusable bags that used more plastic to produce, and will inevitably end up in a landfill‚Äî*but at least we paid for it*
Not only are the stores selling you bags, but they are also saving a ton of money because they no longer have to purchase and provide bags to shoppers (paper or plastic).  It's a win-win for them and of course none of that savings is being passed onto the shoppers.
IIRC even though it has a number for recycling, most of those bags cannot be recycled. So even if it gets sorted, it's still off to the landfill.
The trick is not to have a space for them at home. I unpack them and stick them on the tiny table by the door with my keys so they‚Äôre in the way and I have to take them outside. I have all kinds of tricks for my forgetful brain! üòÜ
When I unpack my groceries, I hang my bags on the handle to the garage door so that the next time I go out the garage, I can just toss my bags into my car. Otherwise I‚Äôd forget!!
Two tricks that helped me. First, stop bringing them in the store. It is faster and easier to put the items back in your cart. Then you can load the bags at your car where you can take your time. Doing it that way lets me pack the bags based on where in my house items will go so I can carry a whole bag to the right place to unload. Second, when I unload at home I put them all into one bag and then hang it on my front door knob. That way I can‚Äôt miss them the next time I am going somewhere. I carry them out and put them back in my car so they are ready for the next use.
i make sure to buy multiples around halloween - i love the sugar skulls one shoprite had 2 years ago.

i ended up using a marshalls skull bag under a rainbow disco ball bag as an impromptu lampshade for a cheap floor lamp last summer, it actually worked pretty well and looked quite festive!  (on vacation with two little kids, screwed up and the camera we brought with us didn't have night vision so i needed a bright-enough-for-the-camera-to-see night light.)
Nahhh I can‚Äôt do that, bread has carbs and gluten and even if you shake the crumbs out the oils and scents are still on the bag and ants have an impeccable sense of smell lol so I‚Äôll pass on that. I do however use the plastic bags for veggies and fruits as a compost when I‚Äôm cooking but that‚Äôs about it
this would never work for me in self-checkout - i'd inevitably end up mixing up things i scanned already, no matter how hard i try to keep them separated.  thankfully i generally don't forget when it comes to groceries.  anywhere else i'm walking out with an awkward armful of crap because ""i only need that one or two things"".
Mine do the same lol. I‚Äôm so happy when they bring them
Because that was always part of the job. Unless you never shopped pre bag ban. It also helps moves things along. Go to trader joe and you see how efficient they are with bagging the groceries
It‚Äôs almost as if I have a severe neurological disorder that makes my memory extremely poor :)
NJ plastic consumption had tripled since the bag ban
Because they fucking rip us off with everything else
Small places like restaurants are excluded. The actual law basically targets high volume businesses that do X amount of sales per month.
And the bags at Chinese restaurants are the good thick ones.
I do think its silly that the original law didn't offer some type of paper\disposable option that was charged specifically as a line item to the customer.

Enough to encourage people to use the reusable, without them having to buy additional ones they don't need.
Yep‚Ä¶
Nah, I go there to argue about hoagies‚Ä¶plastic bags is an added bonus‚Ä¶
I think you can gauge where a society is at based on how passionate people are about things that inconvenience only them slightly.
Sources please or you are just bloviating.
No, they paid for the groceries first. 

The laundry basket was the pro-tip, stealing wasn‚Äôt.
How much were they please? 
Are they bags or crates?
Not a member so might want friend to pick up for me.
Yeah, when I go to a non-self-checkout, I make sure to stack the belt, put my phone with my card on the reader, and stand at the end and bag rapidly.  I generally end up waiting, but earlier this week I had a cashier put me through my paces, it was refreshing.
I know the cashiers love it too!
I hate stuff touching my hands or else I would :(
A wedding dress competition
Local food banks accept them around me, they use them as a convenient means of separated and distributing sets of food.
I don't understand why places like Instacart don't offer to just pick them up when they drop off to offset whatever they paid for them at the store and to re-use them, etc.  I have a ton of them and yeah, it's dumb they don't pick them up for you as well.  I'd even give them for free at this point.
I bring extra ones to my classroom for when kids have extra stuff that doesn't fit in their backpacks. You can see if your local friendly teacher wants them?
I like to throw mine in the street to blow around and give the governor something else that's useless to be assertive about.
Thanks! I wonder if Amazon Prime will do that.
This is good to know. I have about 50 of these bags and not all are pristine but do the job.
Thank. I know I can purchase them. But I don‚Äôt have a line item in my family‚Äôs budget for plastic bags and my whole career I‚Äôve just been able to collect them for free.
That is beyond silly if it is true. Costco g ives away boxes. Lidl gives away boxes. The point of the law was to stop manufacturing single-use bags. Preventing people from re-using a box that is already in the store is asinine and suggests the real goal is selling bags vs. reducing waste.

Yes! I always bring my extra bags into work for our food pantry to use when we have amassed more than we can use. I believe Shop Rite will also take the bags back if you bring them back to the store but it‚Äôs easier for me to donate them.
Because it's not sanitary.  I would not want my food being placed in a reusable bag that was in someone else's house.
Take a bunch of the veggie bags & go thru self checkout. Thinner but would still work.
Thanks‚Ä¶I was going for corny‚Ä¶
Nooooooo!

They will.  They clean and reuse them.  I donate all to my local food bank.  They always need bags to give people food.

Real ID experience at Newark MVC Mar 26,"Appointment was at 10:45. I reached the location at 10:15 and there was a line outside. People were sent inside in groups. I went in at 10:35. 

There is a long slow moving queue for ""ID check"". At any given moment, there could be 1 to 3 people at the ID check counter. My IDs were checked at 12:20. Make sure you make no mistakes on the Application form they hand you. If you make a mistake, even if a small one like accidentally writing the wrong date, don't correct it. Get a fresh form and write everything from scratch. 

This is basic logic, but go through your list of required documents before you show up. I counted 3 people arguing with the ID check folks. It is not going to magically fix your missing documents. 

After ID check you get a token and then wait for your number to be called. Pay attention to employees calling your number out because they call it before it is shown on the monitor so don't wear your headphones and zone out. 

Everything else went through easy. 

Location is alright, parking is not plenty, but you eventually get a spot. Delays are caused by other people just not being prepared.

Moving to New Jersey from SoCal,"I recently accepted a job offer in NJ and am planning on relocation. I've read similar posts here, so I'll try not to ask repeating questions.

The job will be in Red Bank area. It seems Monmouth county is a nice area in general. I'm trying to choose 1B apartment that fits my budget (\~$2k) between Eatontown and Matawan.

Eatontown will be 10mins drive to work, pretty commercialized with many things to do, but longer train rider to NYC (which I will be going often).

Matawan looks quieter, more residential, closer to hiking options (I love hiking and landscape photography), and faster train ride to NYC, but commuting to work will be 20-25mins. Would it be a pain driving to work in winter? Is one safer than another? What about diversity? I'm an Asian female. Safety/ diversity / how easy it is to make friends/build network are main concerns for me.

  
Update: I see people mentioning about the ferry option. I'll definitely look into it!

 I will add a couple of more questions here and would love to get to know what the locals think. 

 1) What's your favorite hiking spot in NJ? I'm starting to build a list on AllTrails. 

2) What's the best way to make new friends? I'm thinking joining hiking or photography group. Any other ideas?

NJ is an incredibly diverse place so I wouldn't worry about that.

i can‚Äôt speak to apartments around there, but getting to the city is not exactly easy from either of those locations

Ferry to NYC from Highlands while nice is not cheap just FYI
Monmouth County as a whole is more expensive than a few other counties. Id say just look for apartments you can afford and narrow it down by looking at the surrounding area for things you like or need. Do you want to be right be a certain grocery store? GYM? Jersey is going to feel a lot different than SoCal but you aren't going to stand out.
Fair point. I'll look into the ferry option.
Yeah, from what I have read, the public transportation and commuting part are definitely going to be a bit learning curve for someone coming from LA. 

I know a lot of people choose to live in Jersey City/Hoboken area for the convenience but it's highly populated and expensive. I think I will enjoy the suburb vibe of Monmouth county.
Thanks for the heads up!
Yes, I think cost of living wise, it's not gonna be too different from what I have in LA. Maybe cheaper gas and lower taxes.  
And no, not necessarily. I see there's a Costco nearby where I do most of my grocery shopping. And honestly, anything within 20mins driving distance is good enough for me.   
And good to know that I won't be standing out lol I have definitely travelled to some small towns where I was constantly stared at.

the towns are spread out here, each area has its own vibe, and everything is about 30 minutes apart. a car is absolutely necessary to get around to most places. the suburban sprawl, highway traffic, access to beaches and mountains, the demographics/vibe/lifestyle in general - a lot closer to LA than new york city is. new york is just its own animal entirely - nothing can really be compared to that. nyc is very accessible from parts of jersey, but you can go 30 minutes south and an hour trip into the city can easily turn into 2.5 hours because of the lack of public transportation connectivity. 
 
there is public transportation, but as you said, it‚Äôs more concentrated up north (newark, hoboken, jersey city, those areas) than where you‚Äôre looking. the areas you‚Äôre looking at are essentially beach towns or suburbs of beach towns. the areas up north or suburbs of NYC - a lot more convenient if public transportation is important, and also a lot more gritty

the shore areas are way ‚Äúnicer‚Äù, more spread out, but i think you will need a car. even to get groceries and stuff. 

just my two cents.


edit - i saw your questions about making friends. you might have a very different experience here, but as someone born and raised between nyc/nj, i quite frankly don‚Äôt have many friends. people aren‚Äôt social here in the same way they seem to be in warmer parts of the country, to be honest. everyone kinda sticks to their families and the few close people they know. i imagine living out in brooklyn or the middle of manhattan might be different, but people in jersey are a lot more socially isolated in comparison. i‚Äôm in my 30s and haven‚Äôt cracked this myself yet. it was easier in school/college. making friends feels a bit impossible now. new jersey is a lot more family-friendly than ‚Äúyoung and single‚Äù-friendly.
I totally agree. I wouldn't compare LA to NYC, the latter is just a different world. 

I will bring my car over to NJ, so I'm still flexible and won't solely rely on public transportation. So far, I think Monmouth county will be a better fit for me. I will enjoy the suburb/beach town vibe more than Jersey City. 

And thanks for sharing your thoughts on making friends. I can definitely relate ‚ÄîI'm not super socially open myself and only have a small circle of close friends. I think it has less to do with geo-location but more about the time we are living in. In some ways, dating is easier than making friends these days.
ah okay yeah with a car, monmouth county is really nice. 

there is a ton to to in nj, especially near the shore areas - you just kinda have to search for it / it isn‚Äôt always as obvious as all the activity happening in nyc since it‚Äôs more dispersed. joining a hiking group is a good idea, or maybe a local group fitness studio or something. asbury park is great for restaurants, cafes, local music - not too far from the areas you mentioned.
Thanks for all the tips!"
Car Pre Purchase Inspection - Paterson NJ,"Hello,

I am looking at potentially buying a used car that I found in Paterson NJ. I live around 2 hours away so I wanted to see if anyone had recommendations for a good shop that can perform a pre purchase inspection prior to me driving the 2 hours. I read that Paterson isn't exactly the nicest area, so I was hoping someone would be able to point me in the right direction.

The vehicle in question is a Ford F150.

Also, as a side question. Anyone have experience from Fast Track Motors?

Thank you all in advance!",1.0,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jklzeq/car_pre_purchase_inspection_paterson_nj/,7,1jklzeq,2025-03-26 20:35,"Dude don't buy anything from Paterson. Ever.

From running a $19m deficit, not being unable to control the students and an insane turnover in staffing levels.
You know maybe if they stop diverting so much money to the private schools in that town they would have more money for the public schools so they can provide services
Lakewood needs to convert to a complete and total land value tax, and we need to tax religious organizations

That would solve so much
Have they tried giving them detention
Sadly, the children who attend public schools in that district and the taxpayers throughout the state bear the brunt of years of selfish, inequitable decisions by the BOE. Although I‚Äôm sure you have teachers and admin there that are professional and care about kids, it sounds like many are beaten down and realize things are only going to get worse in Lakewood. I‚Äôm pretty sure the staff in Lakewood are not the cream of the crop, or else they would have left the district in search of greener pastures. That's likely what happens to the top teachers/admin that start their careers there. They bolt and continue a cycle of turnover that rarely lets anything good take root in the classroom or school. At some point, the state will stop subsidizing Lakewood and schools will close.
Is it time for the daily Lakewood hate post?

I get the town has major issues, but teachers EVERYWHERE complain about this shit. Go to the teacher sub and read posts from teachers across the country quitting because children are out of control and parents/administration won't do anything. 

I swear, you can post anything negative about Lakewood here and people would act like the sky is falling and it's a completely unique situation.
Don‚Äôt forget the lawyer making 50k a month base.
I was thinking the same thing. What‚Äôs happening over there?
Didn‚Äôt they just lose like 15 million of a 50 million loan they just got from the state?
Thats the real problem

They are sucking all the money out of the district and starving it

Howell and Jackson are starting to have real issues as well and in 5, 10y its probably going to be the same kind of fucked up situation
Lolololol

Bless you, sweet summer child
Lakewood has issues that are not common place across NJ. Needing loans to pay teachers and unsafe working conditions should not be tolerated.
I'm looking for support. The more this article is read and shared, the louder the message to the school board. 

I'm a frequent flyer on the teacher sub and teachers need help. It can be an echo chamber there. Lakewood needs help and they need help from other Jersians.

The sky is falling; the kids are not alright. Come to the next board of ed meeting and help us.
Oh, the irony. 

The reason there are so many posts about specifically Lakewood is because there are so many issues in, again, specifically Lakewood.

But you're right, we should completely ignore the corruption and nonsense that goes on there. We should dare not post or communicate what everybody else in the state is talking and reading about, lest trippintunez gets their undergarments in a wad.

It is a completely unique situation.
Yeah that entire district needs some serious oversight. [12%](https://www.nj.com/education/2025/01/nj-school-district-says-its-broke-cant-pay-teachers-without-emergency-loan.html) of their budget in 2023 was spent on bussing for private students. 


>About 12% of the district‚Äôs $200 million budget in 2023 went to school transportation costs for private students, and the budget is also required to cover their special education costs.
50%+ of the school budget funds transportation and special education for private schools. Lakewood has 5,000 public school students and 50,000 private school students.
Demographics lol
I‚Äôm in Jackson and it‚Äôs already happening. 
So far 3 schools are closing‚Ä¶ AP classes are being canceled, opportunities become more limited‚Ä¶ now we have to pay out of pocket for late buses and every school activity. 

It‚Äôs just so sad to see. 

Next year 2 high schools will merge.
I‚Äôm so glad this is finally being recognized but it‚Äôs too little too late.¬†

Ironically until Covid, when the large gatherings were happening in Lakewood, nobody on Reddit cared and I was called an antisemitic Nazi for mentioning it multiple times for the 10 years prior. Couldn‚Äôt talk about the issues and now the chickens have come home to roost.¬†

It‚Äôs too late, and short of completely dismantling every aspect of the community, which wouldn‚Äôt survive scrutiny under the first amendment, there‚Äôs no hope. The only way to solve the issue now would be to go nuclear on education targeting private schools, which to apply fairly, would cause many issues in other parts of the state.¬†

Maybe learn a lesson and listen to people with lived experiences next time instead to throwing around isms and calling chicken little¬†
Honestly it‚Äôll be the whole country soon after Trump is done with the BOE and his project2025 plans to fund private religious schools with tax dollars
;(
That is required by state law.  But no other municipality is like Lakewood where they have \~5k public school students and \~50k private school students.
You can‚Äôt touch Lakewood. The corruption runs so deep, and the voter bloc is well organized too.
now thats a place that needs to get DOGE'd, that is if DOGE was competent themselves
Im of the opinion that you shouldnt be getting paid by the school district to send your kids to private school

Thats your choice imo, you have a school system provided for you and if you choose not to use it then dont, pay extra to send your kids to private school.....or at the very least, here is your voucher, the kid is out of the system, you figure out transport ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We live in a fuckin society, the school system is funded by everyone because it benefits everyone. When you have a super insular group of people that have no interest in being part of that society and want their own society that creates major problems for everyone else.....as is quite obvious now
But they'll only want those private schools meant for Christian schools, not other religions.
I 100% thought this was not a serious question.

Of course they have assigned detentions but nothing is really stopping kids from leaving the building and getting on their busses. Failure to report to detention results in a rescheduled detention. Failure to go to that second detention results in ISI (in-school suspension) where they pick keys off laptops, play on their phones, watch videos, and hang out with the rest of their ""gang.""
Sorry I should've clarified that aspect - Lakewood seems to operate on a different public/private setup compared to the rest.
Iirc bussing costs are higher because the boys and girls busses are segregated for those private schools.
The problem isn't the private schools (although the rate of special ed is really suspicious). It is the artificially low tax rate combined with a priority to fund those special ed costs over the district schools.

If the special ed weren't paid out until the budget was balanced and a baseline of funding went to the schools, everything would change real quick.

Only hope now is probably a state takeover of the district
A huge issue is the LAW that states it‚Äôs the taxpayers responsibility to bus kids to school, private, ¬†public or religious.

Lakewood has taken advantage. ¬†They have created bus companies and entire schools as a way to funnel money from the public system to abuse this law. ¬†

Why don‚Äôt any of the gov candidates or senators ever talk about this? ¬†Most likely they are afraid of the huge block of voters that is abusing the system.
Haha, jokes on them because there is no way to distinguish, they would have to blatantly and explicitly promote a christian theocracy to make that happen
It wasn‚Äôt a serious question lol
It wasn‚Äôt a serious question lol

Help with 6 points of ID for teenage brother.,"Hello everyone. I recently made an appointment for my 17 year old brother to get his non drivers ID. Trouble is, i didnt know my mom doesn't have his birth certificate. He was home schooled then dropped out of schooling so he has nothing with his name on it. The only thing he has is his social security card, maybe (99% sure) a medical insurance card. 

What documents can I use? He needs the ID before getting his GED, license, and a job. so we need it quick. our parents are complacent and lazy. I'm trying to avoid having to get a new birth certificate for now, as the appointment is close and that can be done at a later time. thank you in advance. ",0.33,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jkkesx/help_with_6_points_of_id_for_teenage_brother/,20,1jkkesx,2025-03-26 19:31,"Wait homeboy dropped out of homeschool?
Birth certificate is basically mandatory at this point.  You can pretty easily track down a copy for $20 by writing to / calling the county he was born in. 

A high school diploma is also usually accepted (you will need this in addition to birth certificate) so he will need something having been home schooled from the district acknowledging this.
in some cases, if they were born in nj you can request a new one through the department of health: vital statistics!
Yup...the Vital Statistics office in the town he was born in can give a copying birth certificate.

 The ""primary document"" for the 6 points has to be either a birth certificate... passport...  or a current photo employment authorization card (Form I-688B or I-766.)  Birth certificate being easiest and fastest to get. 

If you live far away from where he was born one can be ordered on the website:
https://www.nj.gov/health/vital/index.shtml

He can use mail for proof of address. And yr parents can get him a debit card to use for proof of identity also. Sone banks have teen accounts...and sone a parent has to open a joint account. (If doing g a joint account i suggest NOT having g overdraft protection, this way he CAN'T get himself in trouble w fees,lol. Bank Of America has a safe balance banking, Chase has teen accounts. Just Google around the subject. 

Hope this helps. üñ§
Go to the dmv website. It's all listed there
OP, given that your brother was homeschooled, I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs a chance that he was also home birthed.  In which case he *should* still have a birth certificate, but sometimes that‚Äôs not the case depending on parents‚Äô beliefs, etc.  Honestly, since you‚Äôre going down this path anyway, you might as well do at least some basic work on getting a copy of the birth certificate, like asking your parents for the information you‚Äôd need to get one, and calling the relevant office to make sure one exists.  (I needed a copy of mine recently, and it was basically just a matter of filling out an online form, but I did need to know the city & state I was born in.) 

If it turns out there never was a birth certificate, my understanding is that your state or federal legislature representative might be of help to get things in order.  If you can‚Äôt get it sorted before the ID appointment, then do without as best you can, but stay on the task until he gets it all sorted out.
If you live close to where your brother was born, getting a new birth certificate is easy. I just had to get a new one because my original didn‚Äôt list my parents. You can check online to see where you need to go and if you need to call in advance.
I once used my birth control prescription as part of my six points, so if he has any current medications with his name and address on it, that might help.
I got a copy of mine, embossed even, in the town where I was born. May be easier than county.
it was a nicer way of saying my parents are selfish and suck.he's trying to get his life going, but they are unreliable
Homeschool dropout. Love it.
The only complication is if his birth certificate is not from an English speaking country, that will increase both the time and money involved by a good bit.
Or, if you can visit the county offices in your birth county, you can get one immediately. Or order one at vitalchek.com
i found this website, i need too make sure it has the new jersey official seal on it. when i went for my ID the dmv made a fuss because i used the hospital certificate, not the official nj state with the steal on it
ive obviously been there. but as I said he has absolutely no form of ID. literally nothing with his name on it aside from social and maybe a health insurance card.
Just gave Ye an album idea..
It is the NJ dept of health‚Ä¶. It should have this seal as you aren‚Äôt getting a form from the hospital!
You can always call and ask? Or goto a physical department of health location and also ask?
To get a copy of his birth certificate, he just needs to go to the town/state where he was born and pay the fee. Call that town's municipal building. 

His student ID is accepted. 
Does he have any type of bank account?
he doesn't have a student ID or bank account. Im thinking of opening him up a chime card account so he has at least something for the time being.
The website says, ""A letter from a public authority"" is acceptable. Get a letter from the school stating he lives there. Maybe that will help."
Did you know that you *must* stop for a stopped school bus? Please enjoy this informational image from our MVC.,Seriously.

Yeah.  And people still keep trying past stopped schools buses!!
Do they not still use the stop signs that pop out? But honestly, this is a driver‚Äôs test basic. The fact that there‚Äôs a post about the subject makes me wonder if NJ drivers are getting their license from a vending machine.
I will pull out into the middle of the road and block the way if I see someone trying to pass a bus. 

Their car is almost certainly more expensive than mine. 

Thankfully I've only done it once.
i always stop. 

but i wanna know, when did they go from a stop where you have like 5 kids there to picking each kid up from their house one by one?? i swear they stop at every house now, 30+ years ago we had to all meet at the corner
Oh god. I really didn‚Äôt know the 10 mph on the oppposite side of a jersey divided highway.
I looked through the info graphic but don't see a specific note on non-divided highways; roads with 4 lanes without a divider. I always stop but have gotten honked at and passed. Do we follow the same rules as a two lane road?
Seriously question:  Anyone know how well self driving cars handle this?  Seems like an interesting scenario around here.
I fear this is common knowledge. Who doesn‚Äôt stop for school buses? STOP THAT!!!
My commute along a county road that‚Äôs a school bus route has been supplanted by a parkway commute. 

My stress level has dropped significantly.
Lmao I actually just this afternoon searched up this image to send to my town Facebook group
I thought that was common knowledge. In fact, the crossing guard or bus driver had the  right to give the license plate number to the police, of the driver who broke  any of the rules. (Not sure if that rule is still in place) This was in the nineties .
Given the amount of school bus incidents involving children being hit by cars after getting off the bus; and crossing guards  getting killed by drivers, who ignore the guard‚Äôs  stop sign: may it should be reinstated
I remember this came up in another thread before. I went to the NJ drivers handbook for answers and it wasn't totally clear on the rare instance of being able to pass the bus. Where in  NJ does a school drop kids off directly next to a highway?
Passing a stopped school bus is a 5 point violation.  
  
6 points = $150 surcharge per year for 3 years, and $25 extra per point  
  
12 points = you lose your license
I have only passed one once. It was a small suburban street and I watched the kid get onto the bus. Then sat there for 5 minutes while mom and the bus driver were having a chat. They ignored my beep. I (slowly) passed, and the bus driver flipped me off.
Lmao I actually just this afternoon searched up this image to send to my town Facebook group
With flashing red lights
The school bus drivers around me are super generous with their yellow warning lights.
Yes. Yes I do.
Ice cream trucks too.

Years ago i did a full stop, and then slow roll past one on the other side of the road, on a 4 lane road, and got busted. argued it with the cop, went to court and tried to mount a philosphical argument over what counts as an ice cream truck (this was some janky van in north bergen selling ice in the park). I lost and i'm still fucking salty about it to this day every time i see an ice cream truck.
Who didn‚Äôt know this?  Especially, with the STOP sign that pops up from the side of the bus?
Yes, I thought everyone knows that.
Everyone knows this, only assholes don't follow it, unfortunately.
When I lived in Staten Island I had to call on a city bus blowing past a school bus. 

A friggin city bus. 

They should know better but noooo he had to be in a rush like the rest of the crappy people in that cesspool.
I won‚Äôt even pass a garbage truck unless they wave me on, it‚Äôs just not worth the risk of hitting a person. Incredible that anyone thinks it‚Äôs okay to ignore the flashing red lights and stop sign.
That's just what big school bus wants you to think.
Tell the school buses in Lakewood they need to stop for red lights as well. Twice, I've almost been taken out by them running a red light on 70 when my light was green.
of course.
Yeah. It's like the main fucking thing they talk about before you take your written test
Of course everyone must stop. Unfortunately whoever decides where the buses are going to pick up kids does not always pick the safest pick-up spot. And no it's not always right in front of a kid's house. I came across a bus stopping basically in the middle of a bad intersection the other day and it caused problems.
I always wonder about stopping for a school bus on the opposite side of the road on a non-divided 4 or more lane road? Surely a bus driver wouldn‚Äôt have students crossing more than one lane right? I still stop but wonder if I should, cause some don‚Äôt.
Yes they have a stop sign which you need to stop for
So, let me be clear, I can't do this? 

https://youtu.be/1UTM40K53K8?si=4jwUxI8wgcZOBrpA
I‚Äôve seen videos of people go over the shoulder to pass a bus
Totally knew this. Even stopped for a school bus responding in an ambulance with lights and sirens.
If you don‚Äôt know this info you‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt be driving ! Sure we can all agree
I never found it difficult to pass by a bus. All you have to do is drive behind the bus and lock eyes with a kid when they eventually look out the back. When that happens use your psychic abilities to overpower their feeble, unguarded mind and transmit instructions to the kid to yell ""driver someone back here has firecrackers"" and then make popping sounds as loud as possible. The bus pulls over without putting up the dtop sign every single time.
Yes, since I was in elementary school. The stop sign that comes out of the side is a good hint.
Common knowledge
Yes! Even if there is a barrier between the flows of traffic. 

Are there seriously people out there that drive past?! What the fuck!!!!
Mainly because of the educational video they showed in school of a child getting off the bus, then getting hit by a car that didn‚Äôt stop, but still.
Every morning, the bus driver puts on the lights, stops the bus, puts out the stop sign, and the crossing bar, and yet every morning, at least 2 assholes don't even slow down. 

The road in question is 202 in Lincoln Park. It's 4 lanes. Sometimes the drivers are behind the bus and just pass it on the left while it's stopped in the right lane. Other times it's people in the other two lanes.

While my town *does* have safety yellow signs indicating a ""bus stop ahead"" up and down both sides of this road, there is *no* signage to indicate that ""all lanes must stop"" and the signs are just signs- there are no flashing lights on them.

One could argue that the county doesn't *need* to include any signs to indicate that ""all lanes must stop"" because all licensed NJ drivers should know that, but here we are ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I used to do that with my old beat up 88' Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. When you see a car with lots of dents and dings do that, one generally reconsiders their actions as that car gave off an aura of ""FAFO"".
I do it too. I have a massive GMC Yukon and a dash cam.
I'm under the impression that lack of sidewalks and increased congestion play a part.
Depends on the age group. I'd say up until high school, I got picked up at my driveway. Starting in high school, I had to walk like a quarter mile to my stop.
20 some years ago I had to walk a half mile down the road to my bus stop. There were no other kids in the neighborhood.
>....30+ years ago we had to all meet at the corner

Gotta start somewhere letting kids know it's not ok to hang on street corners.

üòÜüòÅ

30+ years ago...they'd be mobs of us hanging out on street corners.
Depends how rural the area is
Special ed usually does pickup at the address.
around here it depends where the kid is. Like folks on culdesacs and stuff generally have to walk to the corner, or if a couple of kids all live in houses close together they will pick a corner for the bus to stop, but if its just like a kid every 10 houses, the bus will stop at each house.
I am in my 40s and my school bus did this in the 80s and 90s.
I didn‚Äôt know that either and honestly it‚Äôs a pretty stupid rule. I don‚Äôt understand the point of that whatsoever
Stop, unless there is a barrier separating opposing sides of traffic. 

The idea is a kid could run from behind the bus to cross the street pretty quickly if there is no barrier.
Based on the verbiage on the bottom right, I believe number 1 depicted in figure A would be the law. The first sentence mentions that it applies to any road without a physical barrier.
The rule does not distinguish among different numbers of lanes, only between whether there was a raised divider/physical barrier. Unfortunately, many drivers seem to not know this rule, and I have also gotten honked and almost rear-ended on a few occasions. We definitely need more public education on this.
I have a '24 Tesla with FSD bought. 

It does not stop for the flashing lights, but it will stop for the sign that sticks out. 

From what I understand this is being worked on, after all, it is not a true 'driverless' vehicle, ultimately it's an aid, and the driver must be attentive at all times.
That is a pretty good question
I work as a bus aide in the afternoons and up wouldn‚Äôt believe how many times cars drive right past us. I also thought this was common sense but since starting my bus aide route, I‚Äôve been shown otherwise.
I don't doubt it. I avoid bus stop roads whenever possible. But I still stop for them like I'm supposed to.
There are bus stops on Rt 23. Part of it is a divided highway, meaning there is a physical barrier between North and South bound lanes. You would **not** need to stop for a school bus if, e.g., you are traveling north and the bus stops on the southbound side **if there's a physical barrier** separating the lanes.

If the four lanes are side by side with *no physical barrier* between E/W or N/S lanes, you **must** stop a minimum of 25ft from the bus
Oh yeah, the most annoying thing some bus drivers and parents do. Decide to back up traffic by having a conversation for 10 minutes with the lights still on.

The kid has safely crossed the road several minutes ago, move out of the way if you want to have a conversation.
The ""bus stop ahead"" signs on the roads in my town don't have flashing lights, and they really should.
If there's no physical barrier to separate the lanes, all lanes **must** stop for a stopped school bus with lights / sign.
Oh no, you can totally do that. There's a raised divider there. You're good.
I've seen cars duck out of the right lane to pass the stopped school bus on the left- *with* a patrol car in sight. It happens once a week, at least.
Can pass at 10 mph on the opposite side of a divided highway according to the infographic.
It specifically says ""not divided by some type of physical barrier"" in a few spots.
I used to film the commercial vehicles that didn‚Äôt stop for my kids bus and post the videos on Facebook. I had a police car drive by so I called the police station. Had another school bus drive by so I called that school and complained. Called my town and they sent a police car one day to sit and watch. After the first day I never saw them again. 

It got to the point where I just gave up because it was a daily occurrence. My suggestion is to just make sure your kids get on safe and don‚Äôt drive yourself crazy.

Do you believe that the people on the other lanes that are not stopping are doing so because they saw the school bus and just said ""f it, might kill some kids but I don't have time.... But I'll stop at the next traffic light as usual""?   I doubt you believe that because if it's two a day it's definitely not intentional.   So rather than fix whatever the inherent problem is with that stop the town and the police would  rather see it as a money making opportunity.  Just put a camera up and tag everyone going through for $500 (which is what ud end up with in court).  

There is a problem stop in Jefferson at 15 and Berkshire valley road.   They write hundreds of tickets for that stop alone per month.   Do they do anything to fix the problem???  No f'ing way.    The job of law enforcement is to enforce the law... Not to protect your kid.   So that's what they do.  

If I were you I'd write a scathing rebuke to the superintendent... Pointing out that u want the stop fixed.. Not a money making operation off the backs of kids safety.
i mean k-3 sure..i can see why. but kids in middle school or higher???

we didnt have sidewalks and even when i was in 1st grade they dumped me off at the beginning of my mile long street with like 8 other people. course this was the 80's and 90's.
Rural like Bridgewater? The buses stop at every other house even when there is a sidewalk for kids to walk
Ty. I thought it was just me!
Thank you!
I was surprised to find out that unpaved spaces over 5 ft wide, or raised medians, count as a divided highway. A bit of grass isn't going to pose any barrier to a kid.

I've linked an infographic showing this, since I can't post the image directly: https://www.tapinto.net/towns/morristown/sections/education/articles/morristown-drivers-reminded-of-school-bus-passing-laws-as-school-begin

I've seen infographics for other states that allow drivers to pass on undivided multi-lane highways, and others that require drivers to stop on both sides of divided highways.
Excellent, you found it. Thank you very much!
Thank you, agreed!
Seems like a tough ask of the car, around here at least.   Busses stop quick and throw the sign out.  Narrow roads so they don't pull over so far.  From the opposite direction seems to be even tougher of an ask.   One of my kids has a Tesla and we tried out the fsd for a little while, but didn't come across busses.   Good insight.  Thanks.
As do I. Other drivers? Not so much.
In the section about passing a stopped school bus, you pretty much described situation 3. If you look at situation 4, it does seem to say that you can pass a bus at 10 mph in either direction, on a highway, if the bus is at a school-type facility. No requirement for a barrier.
It‚Äôs getting ridiculous how many people simply can‚Äôt follow the rules of the road. Ive stopped at cross walks to allow pedestrians through only for some jack ass to go around and nearly hit them going into an opposing lane of traffic
Was not aware of this part of the law.  
Not sure if I've ever seen anyone slow down to 10mph in such circumstances.
UUUUMMMMM..........
It's pointless to write to the superintendent. They're planning to cancel all the buses for kids under 2mi from the school, despite the fact that it's at a ridiculous intersection itself AND on the road with the most blind hairpin turns in town, which goes over about like a lead balloon. 

We're moving out of state in June, so I can't follow up on any legislation- but I sure would like to see additional/effective signage.

But yes, I absolutely believe that 50% of the drivers who pass the bus legitimately think ""fuck it, I'm late.""
And the NTSB and MVC  and DOT have likely had *many* complaints etc about children who were injured, killed, or disappeared from walking on unsafe roadways.


When I was in 1st grade, 6th graders set my classroom on fire and my class was relocated to an entirely different school in another part of town. To accommodate the additional transportation load, the class started later, and buses ran later in the day. This meant the sun had set by the time my little first grade self was getting off the school bus, and I walked the mile all the way up the hill of my development to my house, alone, in the dark, for several months. It was considered safe at the time. It always terrified the shit out of me.


It's not really fair to compare ""kids these days"" to the way we were all raised, though, because we've generally opted *not* to treat our kids the way our parents treated us. Society, the environment, safety considerations- all very different now.
Yeah, that's weird. i do wonder what it is. I don't think its just, ""Back in my day!..."" Something happened. My kids all walk to stops. The high schooler walks half a mile. 

Are the kids being stopped for special needs?

Did they do a traffic study and they don't want kids to walk along 206 or 202 or similar road, even if there are sidwalks?

Does that district allow parents to request an individual stop if needed, and all the parents got wind of it and called?
They don't appear to be special needs, but who knows. This isn't along 202/206, but all over. Seen it on side streets as well with very little traffic"

Did the denial include directions for appealing (the official phrase is ‚ÄúFair Hearing‚Äù)? When my mother‚Äôs request was denied I had a Fair Hearing. It was surprisingly informal.

From what you wrote here it just sounds like they didn't submit something? I'd talk to one of the organizations that help with applications. We chose the non profit route and went with New Jersey Citizen Action who were amazing, but there are other options depending on where you are.

https://www.nj.gov/getcoverednj/help/local/
Yes it does include fair hearing. So in their bank account there is about $1500 each and they got 1099 for 2024 which is less than $10,000 each. However is it possible to find which number they are having issues with.
Ok, so I talked with a delegate and they have insurance through GetCovered. It was a letter from NJFamilyCare that they got and am not sure why they received it. GetCoveredNJ and NJFamilyCare are 2 different programs.
You might call your county Board of Social Services. You might get lucky and speak to someone who can explain what happened. (In my case the county never returned calls so I had to go the Fair Hearing route. But once I got to speak to a human the entire thing was cleared up in a few minutes)
You can do both on Get Covered. You start there and if you qualify it then puts you to Family Care.

But if you have someone helping you, ask them. Thats what they do! The woman who helped us with family care was really good, replies to emails or texts within a day, even months after signing up.
Ok, so I talked with a delegate and they have insurance through GetCovered. It was a letter from NJFamilyCare that they got and am not sure why they received it.
They are permanent resident/Green Card for just over 2 years and don't think they will qualify for NJFamilyCare. However, delegate advised to check if they qualify for Medicare/Medicaid.
NJ FamilyCare is what NJ calls medicaid, so its the same thing. But I think theres a minimum time requirement for immigrants to qualify. I dont know the details on that, or on Medicare. I hope you can figure it out. If the person you're working with now can't help, try and find another.

Huge income disparity in the city with high end shopping but then some rougher blocks. The hotel is in a fine spot right by the highway there and should be safe.
That area is fine and is filled with ""luxury"" apartments.
Englewood is fine. Lots of food and shops.
Englewood is fine, transit is fine. You might give the hotel a call and ask if they have a shuttle to the bus stop.

Avoid bringing your own car. Driving in Bergen County is insane. (Speaking as one who learned how to drive there. I live in Central Jersey, now.)
We had planned on driving right to the hotel and then public transit for the rest of the trip. Thoughts ? We're coming from Canada!
Well, it's almost all highway. Don't expect much in the way of courtesy from other drivers. It's a suburb that drivers treat like a city.
You will be completely fine, plenty of open parking in that neighborhood. There's also a medical center, a luxury gym, and other amenities in that area so it's super safe. Enjoy your trip!

Not the easiest from Englewood.
Did some googling, the closest bust stop will be 26 miles.

Very easy. Within walking distance there are NJTransit buses that run every 40 minutes and jitney busses that arrive every 5 minutes. That will take you across the George Washington bridge into 178th street bus terminal. You can take the A train south from there.

Be wary, the busses do not run past midnight from the 178th street station. You would need to grab a late night bus from the port Authority bus terminal on 42nd street or just take an uber

Edit: for NJtransit busses you‚Äôll want to download their app and buy tickets there (2 zones). The jitney buses are cash only and around $4 per person each way

Edit 2: the hotel is on RT 4 which in a section that doesn‚Äôt have a pedestrian crossing. You need to get to the other side of the highway. You‚Äôll need to walk about 26 minutes or take a bust West, walk across the pedestrian crossing then take the bus east.

For fun, I enjoy watching TV (right now, I‚Äôm binging House MD and Rick and Morty); spending time with my girlfriend; volunteering; learning about psychology, medicine, and psychiatry; and playing basketball ‚Äî although I haven‚Äôt played in a while.


Questions for you:


What are your interests and goals? What‚Äôs a challenge you‚Äôre currently trying to overcome? What‚Äôs something you wish people better understood about you?

Coming in to these comment sections is always so depressing. NJ is not the well educated progressive state it pretends to be.
I'd like to see a complete breakdown of that budget and where it was spent exactly.....

NJs budget for transportation has been around 3 billion....what exactly did nearly 4 times the budget of our transportation go to.
Grants were written to cover into 2027. These funds are directly available and used for routine consumables, staffing, and contracts. Obviously yes that is the issue, money that was there for spending is yanked away without any time to phase out and absorb necessary budgeting.
No we don't lol. Our entire state tax income is 120 billion....

He's hardly even being a dick
Going by time stamps he's probably referring to the guy ""can't see shit"" and is crocodile tears about how difficult it is to look up where the money goes (it's readily available)
OK.....why are we still spending money on covid when the pandemic was declared over?
Right?

Wild I'm getting down voted for wanting to know where my tax money is going. If it's going to good causes then it shouldnt be a problem to ask and see.
This really affects every state, public health funding is typically at least half federal. This especially applies to rural states.
They are already doing this with ICE targeting blue cities/states, the new election EO that forces purges of voter roles, etc. It will DEFINITELY be targeted to blue city/states first and then expanded to the red states once they say we are bitching about nothing.

They don't put the number that's accurate in these emails, they put the number that is most likely to generate the highest conversion rate or revenue per thousand recipients.

That $55 CPV is 100% made up to get you to donate $55. If the data suggested that they could succeed with a $200 or $2,000 ask, they'd put that number in instead.

While we're at it, I hate to disappoint you, but they don't actually need exactly 13 more donors from your zip code before the quarterly filing deadline.
NJ5 is not vulnerable. It may have been under the old maps but the new maps? It would take a landslide nationally. By the time NJ05 falls, Republicans would have a 50-75 seat majority. And even then it would be close.


And fundraising doesn't automatically translate into votes. It helps at the margins but you can't just reduce it to ""$100 / vote"". You could spend a trillion and still not oust the incumbent in most districts in this state.
And Mikie Sherrill NJ11 is running for gov. The gov can‚Äôt appoint a replacement. You need an election. Off!
You should cross post this in r/50501 with a link to the Dem running in FL06. Sounds like they need some donation support.
NJ11 is D+6 and NJ5 is D+4. The R candidate would need a significant overperformance relative to the national environment to win in either, and the national environment is currently and in 2026 will likely be D-leaning. In a year like 2010, sure, they‚Äôd both be vulnerable, but both stayed D in 2022 and 2024, so I‚Äôd be *extremely* skeptical that either is at risk while Trump is in the WH.

Wait.... surely you aren't suggesting that people trying to get me to give them money might be dishonest! Say it ain't so!
Musk‚Äôs funding is limitless. 55 or 1000 or 5000‚Äìhe needs 10k votes to flip NJ11 and 7k for NJ5 in a special election.
But how else are they going to get the match???
For a moment I thought somebody was on their way to depose Gottheimer and got excited.

If he ends up with the gubernatorial primary I am marching straight into the Atlantic.
FL06 is a Trump+30 district too. The fact that it is close even should have Republicans shitting bricks (and that PA Lancaster win)
In a special election with a lesser known candidate who is underfunded and limited runway and low turnout (15 pct of usual), it sure is vulnerable if Musk gets involved. So is NJ11.
They fortified NJ11 at the expense of NJ7 in redistricting. It‚Äôs now D+6, much bluer than when Sherrill was first elected in 2018.
I don't see nj11 swinging back red. People are feeling the cost pressures.
I donated some. He‚Äôs having early success.
53 million in donations which is the total amount AIPAC spent last year did not flip the democratic party. When the total amount spent by pacs is in the billions. 

The party is out of touch with the people but you got the wrong issue.
Do you think he‚Äôs the only rich guy in the game? Harris raised a BILLION, Trump spent 463M. You think that billion was just $55 donations at a time?
Lesser known candidates and races tend to favor the partisan makeup of the district. If they don't know the candidates, democrats are more likely to just pick the dem and vice versa.


Plus special elections and midterms almost always favor the party out of power. Dems just won a R+15 seat last night. We really thinking they'll be winning R+15s and losing D+6s? Seems unlikely. There's a strong correlation between districts these days.


If that dynamic doesn't hold and the GOP starts picking off D+6 districts... I don't know I guess it's possible but we'd be so beyond saving at that point. Time to fold up the entire party and try again.
Why would there be a special election
Flip them? Im not sure you understand my point- most democrats are on AIPACS payroll and they consistently vote pro-IDF at every given opportunity. So Im done
Lol I vote based on what's best for Americans and NJ but you do you.
Edit: I misunderstood, my bad, I withdraw my original comment.

Original comment: That‚Äôs some A+ politicking right there. Refuse to vote, allowing the party that‚Äôll overtly greenlight the exact thing you say you‚Äôre against to win. Well done.
We provide 60% of those bombs, we've been their only veto dozens of times, and aipac brags about owning 80% of our federal government.  You'd be a fool to think you can separate the 2, especially when the 1st amendment rights of legal residents are being violated for speaking out against genocide and when colleges are being bribed 400 million dollars to stifle protesters
Me too. Politicians working for the highest bidder instead of their constituents is not whats best for Americans. So I'm done giving them my money
I said ""donate to."" Not ""vote for.""

We all have to vote for the lesser of two evils when it matters, but im not giving them any more of my money for it
Your not going to convince me any of the 2nd half has anything to do with anything other than Trump and the Republicans looking for an excuse to crack down on higher education. Whats your excuse for Upenn is that because APAC hates Lia Thomas /s. 

And you going to give a source for anything else you quoted in the first half? and Yes the vetoes were appropriate when the resolutions were one sided.
Okay that‚Äôs fair, sorry I misunderstood what you were saying. Long as we‚Äôre all voting D when push comes to shove all good in my book.
You are a grown person actively using the internet.  A 2 second search makes every one of my points easy to confirm

"possible bachelorette trip to Jersey, need advice!","Possible Bachelorette Destination?

Hi everybody, 22 from Buffalo NY and my girlfriend (my age) is getting married! She really loves Jersey Shore, and clubs, drag bars, etc. I feel like this might be a good place to go, but everybody is saying the nightlife doesn‚Äôt exist here anymore? Now I‚Äôm thinking we don‚Äôt have to necessarily stay in jersey city but close by so we can see the shore house. Does anybody have any advice/experience? Any places outside of Jersey City that has a good night life? we are only going for three days and she wants to party!!",0.22,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jkdfal/possible_bachelorette_trip_to_jersey_need_advice/,12,1jkdfal,2025-03-26 14:43,"I see you added she's not beachy but I feel like Asbury Park has the vibe you're looking for. There is the beach, but also an entire town filled with shops, amazing food, bars, etc. Usually drag events and live music on the weekends and definitely a lively bar/dancing scene, especially for a younger crowd. Not sure what time of year you're planning but the summer will be guaranteed to be bumping in town.
Jersey City? You might as well party in Manhattan there tons of good clubs in the village / SOHO. JC is no where near the jersey shore. If you want to club at the shore Seaside is good, Asbury Park is also good. Atlantic City too. It‚Äôs about a 2 hour drive to the shore FYI. If she isn‚Äôt beachy and wants a jersey bar, Morristown has plenty of them. Clubs and bars all in walking distance too. Located about an hour west of JC.
Hoboken
Depending on your party size, there's Feathers in River Edge. 
My daughter (22, non-binary) and friends went there last year for her birthday and each other's. 

It's small but they have a great time there.
Asbury Park! absolutely.
Are you flying or driving? If she wants nightlife with Jersey Shore vibes I‚Äôd do Atlantic City. Convenient airport in town. One hour from Seaside. I‚Äôm partial to the Borgata but it‚Äôs the furthest from the boardwalk.
also i‚Äôll note she‚Äôs a ginger so beachy vibes isn‚Äôt really her
we are planning for early september. and yeah she really just wants to shake ass, or dance to live music. have a good time. she doesn‚Äôt care for the generic white girl bachelorette shit.
i‚Äôve seen this on google, can you recommend any bars or clubs ? sorry i‚Äôve never been in the area
This is really funny for some reason
Asbury Park.  There's a beach, but you can just, like, not go there.  It's a whole town with a ton of stuff to do.  She'd probably like the drag shows at the Empress.
Mad Hatter and The Shannon are good bars. Few of my friends have been there multiple times. Can‚Äôt say I know any good clubs in that area. There‚Äôs a train station called the PATH which takes you directly to NYC in Hoboken. You could always try that."
Josh Gottheimer‚Äôs Plan‚Ä¶,"
TLDR‚ÄîJosh Gottheimer needs to stay in Congress. He is not qualified to run the state. Even as Congressman he‚Äôs kind of iffy, but could be worse. 

This is what Rep Josh Gottheimer‚Äôs josh4jersey plan is about. 

1. Incentivize municipal governments to cut 5 percent of the budget.

2. Cut 5 percent of state level budget.

3. Sue NYS to get the other 5 percent.

4. Give property tax breaks to those who move from lower tax states üòÜ 

5+5+5-x=15-x

Except, this is not doable.

1. Municipal governments cannot simply cut 5 percent, as we know, because wages and suppliers are not going to be able to handle it, especially given inflation running at 3 percent.

2. State cut of 5 percent means massive program cuts. Can you say NJ-DOGE?

3. Union contracts are locked, which means headcount cuts.

4. Giving new movers tax breaks comes at our expense. People are already moving to NJ, so why is that even needed other than he is trying to get billionaires to move here and pay minimal tax (especially, if they move from Hawaii, which he uses as an example).",0.91,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jkd68c/josh_gottheimers_plan/,39,1jkd68c,2025-03-26 14:32,"Imagine giving a tax break to someone who is contributing to the current housing shortage in this state?
He will give a tax break to people coming from Republican states to buy homes here instead of increasing first time home buyer assistance for lifelong residents of the state. Make it make sense.
Paper grocery sacks. Don‚Äôt forget he wants to bring back paper grocery bags for all the smooth brained folks who can‚Äôt remember to bring their own.
Suing NYS, even if it works, only solves the problem for one year, unless he sues perpetually. Also these legal cases take a long time and are expensive.
\#1 is probably doable if you force neighboring townships to combine services. 

\#4 makes no sense unless they plan to significantly increase the amount of available housing.
And wasn‚Äôt he proposing that the Fed also chip in 15% more to NJ?
> Sue NYS to get the other 5 percent.

Who is he going to get to run this, Alina Habba?
I disagree, Josh Gottheimer shouldn't be in state government OR Congress.
His plans are moronic. Property Tax rebates and credits from the state are already out of control, and the tax break for seniors should be killed. All it does is put a band aid on high property taxes,  and give an incentive for them to rise even more at a local level.

And how in the world would you give ""incentives"" for municipalities to cut their budgets 5%? Giving them money isn't really a solid option.
I really wish we could safely primary him without risking his district going Republican
I can't help but wonder if his tax break to draw people to the state is because he believes those stupid moving company stats and thinks the population is shrinking.
Well that‚Äôs certainly stupid.

Hang on a second let me check in with the average voter.


Charlie made some kind of weird shape with his hands and then drew a bird on some paper. I guess he‚Äôs good with this.
I‚Äôd never vote for someone who wants to cut taxes. It never benefits working New Jerseyans. Besides, the public employee pension system is under water. Fix that first.
Oh boy I guess it‚Äôs time for hudson8282‚Äôs daily ‚Äúextremely organic‚Äù Fulop posting
I hear creep Scott Pressler is here and going to steal votes again.
Josh would probably run as a republican if the odds were more realistic for an R to win. You see this type of candidate in a lot of blue states.
In his ‚Äúmanifesto‚Äù page 9 he talks about reducing the housing shortage by building 200,000 more units.

Who is going to build them, where is the land coming from, what about the infrastructure, schools to support that? Besides NJ is crowded enough.
This sub is so scared of gottheimer. There‚Äôs time before the election, just mobilize for another candidate
Paper bags are a brilliant idea.
literally running on ""lets continue to price new jerseyans out of their state so others can move in""
It's been four years. At this point people are just willfully ignorant.
He‚Äôs a joke.
I did a total 180 on this. I thought plastic bags were dumb at first, but I got used to them, and I'm never going back. They're more durable and hold more groceries, anyway. It's just an appeal for dumb people (that might get a few votes his way)
I want the store to give me a bag again. Paper or plastic, I don‚Äôt care. 

It‚Äôs very wasteful that they give me like a dozen nylon bags every time I order groceries that have to get thrown out.
Also, what's he suing NYS for? What grounds
Just put tolls on the NJ side problem solved. And we hopefully get less traffic in NJ
Just put tolls on the NJ side problem solved. And we hopefully get less traffic in NJ
Just put tolls on the NJ side problem solved. And we hopefully get less traffic in NJ
Issue is most contracts are multiple year locked. Plus furloughs/layoffs are difficult to implement.
If he thinks that happens, he‚Äôs more of a joke than he current is.
The proper solution is make all students coming from out of state should pass a placement test, they should be held back a year or so if uneducated.¬†¬†


We should consolidate municipalities to cut down on government costs.¬†


Eliminate any positions in towns that have superintendents for schools that dont exist (ahem branchburg high school superintendent)


We should start charging for any public parking around churches as they should be for local residents not a burden on our streets.


We should also charge more for warehouse taxes, let them leave if it's expensive, Amazon will stay NJ has a high population density Walmart¬† Costco or target will take over.. they destroy the roads
I just hope they‚Äôre getting paid well
Isn't he the guy who just lost a PA senate seat in Amish country to a dem or is that a different Pressler?
Not scared, he‚Äôs just not what we want.
That‚Äôs doable
Holds 5, 2 Liters of soda and has handles, so much easier.
They don't have to be thrown out lol

They did stop, eventually.
this is  scary. wtf?
If someone can identify who they are, I'll make the phone call. OP did you get any more info?
a school vehicle that's insane. 

You should be posting this with a plate on the company page to get that idiot fired before they kill a kid
I hope there were no kids in that van!
hey kids wanna see something cool?
This appears to be the info for the company: https://www.cdlknowledge.com/training/hayat-transportation-inc/
If you got the plate report them
I can hear her/him now! I used to be a school bus driver.
I‚Äôm not sure where this occurred but a few weeks ago, I saw a similar vehicle driving extremely reckless on 80, I was shocked after the driver took the Hasbrouck heights exit and saw the school bus sign. 

People need jobs but some of these people need to be vetted better..
The real plot twist would be that this bus driver did indeed see the train coming, and the gates didn't lower when they should...  which is the whole reason they stop at railroad crossings in the first place.

I'm probably giving them to much benefit of a doubt, but it is a weird spot to be in.  You would think that if the gates and flashers come on while you're on the crossing, that you would be able to keep going i stead of being trapped between the gate and the train.
""School vehicle""
The driver belongs on that train. That's Norfolk Southern 62V. The trash train from Mingo Junction, Ohio to Oak Island, NJ.
Most safe nj driver
not the school vehicle üò≠
Poster child for nj driving
Hope there weren‚Äôt kids in the car!
I remember someone getting stuck on the tracks there when I was a kid.
Whoever the driver is needs to be fired immediately.
I see this all the time in Broward county because dump shits are selfish and stupid and don't understand trains because the brightline is newish ......but I always say how this never happens in nj.


Jersey don't make me out to be a liar
Man, fuck those school vans. They drive like they‚Äôre above the law and then hard break for rail road tracks.
Conductor in training here. Worst nightmare you could have is hitting someone, and in this state you can double that fear because people can‚Äôt wait a few minutes for a train to go by. Had a few close calls even with school buses.
![gif](giphy|13AsDpoKh1hqb6)
Pay shit, hire shit, get shit.
I drive by this almost every day, and the amount of people I see who get caught on those tracks because of the traffic light by the CVS is far too many. If anyone is curious, here's the [Google Maps location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bPCgFLKDZCBtAJ1PA).
How does that even happen üíÄ

This should be a top comment bc I was about to report if someone didn‚Äôt, thank you OP!
Thank you for reporting it. I live down the street (not that it matters really) but I see the school mini-vans driving erratically all the time and it makes me so mad as a mother. It‚Äôs just so irresponsible and there needs to be some accountability. So thank you!
Please see my other comment where you can report this to the state: student.trans@doe.nj.gov

I have a lot of unfortunate experience with these companies that service special needs kids. They won‚Äôt change unless you report it to the state. Thank you for taking action.
Oof and I see all the Honda Van ""School Vehicles"" that blaze through traffic on the parkway
Sadly this company probably will do nothing. See if you can report to the local police too.
You're the MVP.
What if they just really wanted Taco Bell? (I can't tell from the picture if they are going towards or away from the Bell)
Agreed. They should be in politics instead.
A train is literally the EASIEST thing to avoid
Vans like this are usually for children with special needs, too.
Bus drivers are some of the worst offenders on the road. My wife used to be a teacher and she said you‚Äôd be shocked at how many don‚Äôt even have drivers licenses.
This needs to be reported how reckless can they be
Same here, I was shocked to say the least.
You should report it, because (eta: probably) they won't.

You have the location, company name, and the vehicle number. That's enough info for you to report it (with a picture) on your daughter's behalf.
bump this guy up and everyone submit it

this person has no business being on the road
Is that different than this department: student.trans@doe.nj.gov
Someone above posted the company info, seems like ""bus 91"" would be enough info to report! You know, plus this absolutely insane terrifying picture
Me too!
You can‚Äôt get caught on the tracks if you wait to cross them until the light changes and there‚Äôs enough room to cross without having to stop. The problem is people refuse to leave a gap and so they pull fully or partially onto the tracks while they wait for the light. When the train comes, cue the panic for a completely avoidable situation.

Maybe I‚Äôm splitting hairs, but I just felt it wasn‚Äôt quite right to say people ‚Äúget stuck‚Äù on there. People choosing to drive like idiots is something completely within their control.
The only Bagel Chateau I know is in Westfield, so definitely not!
Edison/Colonia
Idk, maybe start with Google maps?
I used to be a bus supervisor for the summer camp I worked at, and the bus driver EVERY DAY would stop on the tracks, open the door to look, and then proceed. I asked her why and she said it was the law, she was required to stop and look before crossing. But, it was like mid crossing?? Literally ON the tracks?? I was 17 and confused but thought she, the adult, must have been right. It's been over 20 years and I hadn't even thought about that again until your comment. That shit was bananas.
OP stated ""dumbass barely backed up in time""

So, no, the van did not do what they were supposed to
This needs to be boosted!
figure out who the insurance company they have, their risk management people would be very interested to see this.  i'll tap my dad and see if he can find out.
Disagree, any company in charge of bussing children will take this VERY seriously. That driver is out of a job.
I don't know about that, trains are notoriously stealthy.
Do you have any other information besides a picture?
I did
They responded quickly
No idea but they responded to me.
You hit it right on the head. This is exactly what I see by people. Essentially they just blindly follow the car in front not seeing if there‚Äôs enough space to fully go over the tracks.
Yes know that one too. One in Edison might before your time. Probably not there anymore or renamed.
Or maybe we stop treating this sub as our local townie FB page? There's literally over 500 municipalities in this state and when someone mentions a street without any other context I feel like I'm on r/oldpeoplefacebook.
What. The. Fuck.  

You NEVER stop on the tracks. In CDL training, you are taught to make sure there's enough room for your full vehicle on the other side of the tracks so you won't be in a position where you're stopped mid-crossing.  

If anyone pulled that during a CDL road test, they would immediately fail, even if they passed everything else flawlessly.
I honestly think the ""stop and look"" law is stupid just because of situations like this. I've seen so many buses crawl over the tracks when simply driving over at a normal speed would probably be safer.
Someone I know from Tennessee said their school bus driver used to do the same. Apparently a lot of stupid people drive school buses.
I notice NJ Transit buses do that, probably for better visibility
If you read the reviews for these types of transportation companies, they‚Äôre full of specific reports of drivers engaging in reckless behavior. Yet they‚Äôre still on the road.
[Theyll chase you down](https://youtu.be/MjbUnn32_zU?si=j1tkiwT4AzoWraSs) as well
This occured at the RR crossing at Inman Ave in Edison. Couldn't get the license plate.
As a special needs mom, thank you.
At the very least it was before I started working in Edison.
Jay‚Äôs Bus Service in Ocean and Monmouth has the worst drivers!
I frequently end up behind this one driver on my way home from work that simply cannot drive, so I would change my route to get around them.  one day my timing was off so I ended up behind them right as they pulled into their work......as a school bus driver.
Having sued them before I can tell you there are many of these small transportation companies that don't care at all
That's okay, it shows as vehicle 91 on the side so not impossible to report to the company.
That‚Äôs okay. You have the company and vehicle number. It‚Äôs registered.

2 points ticket in NY on NJ license,"I got 2 points in NY upstate and I hold NJ license. I know NJ transfers max 2 points from NY. Any ways to remove those 2 points? As I concerned about my insurance premium.

- I have already taken defensive course before violation bc I was getting discount on insurance. So, I checked with NJM and I am no longer eligible as I have taken course already so they can‚Äôt remove points. 

Thank you! ",0.4,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jkau8a/2_points_ticket_in_ny_on_nj_license/,7,1jkau8a,2025-03-26 12:42,"The points on your license are a NJ MVC function.  Your insurer - NJM - doesn't care (much) about the points that NJ MVC says you have. 

Insurers look at your violations history. They look at the exact charges and other details. They don't care what your state or other states decide to call that in ""points"".  Insurers decide how much each moving violation means - to them. They have their own proprietary systems to compute what each violation means. 

Those 2 points only have a meaning to MJ MVC.  As already said, you really only need to be concerned with MVC points when it comes to things like license suspensions under the MVC system.  Under their system, you can take a driver improvement program once a year. Under their system, they remove points every time you go 12 months without a violation. 

The MVC point system has very little meaning when insurance companies get involved. 

NJM has already told you that you have the defensive course discount. You only need to take that course every 3 years to keep that discount.  

You can do other things to make sure you are getting the best rate, but you can't remove tickets you already have.  Make sure your credit report is accurate, and do what you can to improve your credit score.  Go over your declarations page & renewal documents. Make sure you aren't paying for driving more miles than you actually drive. If your health insurance will cover your injuries from auto accidents, you may be able to get a discount for that.
Should have pleaded to a no point violation before court. It usually costs around $300 or so, but if you just paid the ticket you will need to wait a year without a violation and you'll lose them.
Its a common misconception that insurance companies only use points on your license to determine if your rate should go up. Perhaps thats how it worked decades ago but today your rate is likely to go up the same amount even if you spend extra money and time in court to change the ticket to a non-point violation.


Insurance companies are smart, they have access to your full driving record in all states and make decisions based on all of the information not just if a violation included points.¬†


These days you worry about points only if you already have too many on your license already... Because then you may lose your license.
Moving Violations are shared with NJ. Parking Violations are not.
I did. I went to court too. It was 4 points ticket. I proposed for no points and higher fine too. Prosecutor denied and it got deducted to 2 points. I got in Orange county and heard that they are very strict.
How would insurance companies come to know without your DL number? The points are attached to your DL isn‚Äôt?
You provide you insurance company your DL number when you sign up......"

He doesn't care. You can post it all day here. Those who care need to vote him out.
There is a simple way to get rid of him,
Vote him out.
Going to ask a different question. We've asked these same questions over and over and we aren't getting anywhere.  
  
Why do the people in Kean's district re-elect him? Is it a ""don't rock the boat"" kind of thing? Is it a ""we want MAGA thing?""  
  
Right now, as things are, Kean is guaranteed to be re-elected. What has to be done to get Kean out? What kind of candidate?
Tom Kean doesn't give a shit about NJ.
Kean is a Maga dickgobbler....he blows with the wind and the winds of fascism are blowing hard right now
Emailed him a while back during the election, so the time at which you think they‚Äôd care to respond, and nothing. I‚Äôve lived in deep republican districts where even they have generic responses and pretended to care.
I called and emailed chris smiths office, same thing no reply.  And the person that took my call seemed annoyed I was calling.
He doesn‚Äôt give a shit about any of us. He wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye if ICE started rounding up his constituents.
You have to hand it to him, he is smart enough to know his limitations. 

He knows that he is such an unlikable and corrupt  nepo baby stooge that his best chance is just to use daddy's name and daddy Musk's money  and stay out of sight. Hide from the voters, no town hall;s, no meetings, no campaign events, no clinics and not even communication with people who are not known toadies. 

Without this killer strategy he would not be where he is today.
Stop re-electing him.
When you signed up you gave them your phone number.  In theory they will call you before the meeting starts. 

I have signed up for 4 of these.  The first time I was called several minutes after the call started. The other 3 times I never got called.
I'm on this sham of a call now. Disgusting,  honestly.
The Wyoming Congresswoman is probably why Sir Fraidy-cat didn't do an in person meeting. Wouldn't be surprised if his staff looked up up the possible attendees voter registrations to see if they were from the right party.
As I see it Kean narrowly beat Malinowski in the 2022 midterms on one big issue: high taxes and the SALT deduction. Kean is one of those republicans who knows he sits in a swing seat and simply does not want to show he has any character or backbone whatsoever - he got elected on being ""republican classic"" in a political environment that is poisoned by the cult of MAGA and the perceived excesses of the far left. His whole strategy seems to be ""any attention is bad attention"". He cannot risk an in-person town hall going south, he seems to believe sticking his neck out on ANY issue will cost him. In this fraught political landscape the representative from NJ-07 needs to be neither overtly Trumpy nor terribly far left. The irony is that his entire public persona is just parroting the issues handed down by daddy Elon and the WH but doesnt seem to understand that taxes issue carries such weight in this district (and New Jersey broadly) that if he would just show some independence from the broader GOP it might actually endear him to voters in the district. He has more room to maneuver than I think he realizes, he just refuses to. I cannot tell if it's the threat of being primaried by Elon's money or if he's just an empty suit who is happy to have a job in politics like his daddy, but I will certainly not be voting for him in 2026.
On a separate note, I sent something to Andy Kim‚Äôs office last week and got a multi-paragraph response. Assume it was a staffer but it was nice nonetheless
Politics are the joke, he's the Punch Line.¬†
His newsletters are just a pat on the back for visiting local community groups and spreading MAGA talking points. Zero substance.
Tom Kean Jr walked into a bar.  He should have seen it coming!
For those who were alive in the 1980's and old enough to remember was his father a good governor or very popular here? I've watched interviews with him online and while not as bad as his son he has a very flat cardboard personality so I'm amazed he ever got elected governor in the first place.
seeing this guy every two years boils my blood, i want to complete law school then run against him.
Fuck Tom Kean.
I suggest you do some research emails are in and of themselves suspect in the political world because they can be generated by a bot that can literally flood a representatives office with thousands of emails pushing an agenda at any given moment that‚Äôs why most politicians do not even acknowledge receipt of emails. If you wish to be heard, pick up the phone and call the alternative is actually put a stamp on an envelope and send your request in written form. I am surprised somebody indicating some familiarity with political process does not know the story on email you can Google it you can see it you can find it on Quora. You can find a job virtually anywhere and you also probably can get that information from your congressman, you probably called her office and they say no we do not respond to emails because we get thousands of them every week. Let‚Äôs try and be a little bit more astute in our dealings with our representatives. Best regards, Tom.
To be fair... this is true for all politicians.. all they care about it getting elected, and once they win, then they care about staying elected.
> Now, in the parking lot, with no cameras in sight, Curtis thought Kean might answer some questions from a [near-lifelong Republican] constituent. Instead, he got that same blank stare. Curtis asked questions for seven or eight minutes, he says, and through it all, Kean held that robotic expression we all saw in the elevator video. 
> 
> ‚ÄúHe just stood there,‚Äù Curtis says. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòAren‚Äôt you going to answer my questions? And he just stood there. He never said a word to me other than thanks for stopping. And then he turned away.‚Äù 

Christ on a stick, that's pathetic.
I‚Äôm young stupid and voted for him last election‚Ä¶ fuck even younger me and fuck you too, fuck both of you for bing stupid enough to vote for Trump. And fuck trump for lying to his constituents from the drop.
I didn‚Äôt vote for him, but that won‚Äôt win anyone over either.¬†
Ok, we're aware there have been multiple elections he has beaten with literally zero effort, right?  
  
""Vote him out"" is just apathetic at this point.
Sue Altman had an interesting run. She even did the standard 3 questions answered Reddit AMA here. But she had 1 issue that made a lot of people turn away from her. She was a bit too zionist and anti Palestinian. Like, actively engaged in that all consuming black hole.  
  
But, she found a job in Andy Kim's staff.
\>Right now, as things are, Kean is guaranteed to be re-elected.¬†

Yesterday a Dem State Senator in PA won in a district that went to Trump by 15 points. Kean's reelection is not guaranteed.
It's a Republican thing. When Redistricting happened in '22 they made one district lean Republican so they could make another lean Democrat. Even when Malinowski ran in '22 it wasn't likely that he'd win. The  7th is pretty rural for NJ.
During a debate last year Kean was asked about his stance on abortion rights and he literally just sat silent and didn't respond. He doesn't respond to debate mediators why would he respond to one of us plebs.
Me too! Rodney Frelinghuysen was way more responsive.
I'd love to.  I've voted for a democrat in the 7th since I moved here in 2017.  

The D's sacrificed our district in the last round of redistricting after 2020.  They redrew the lines to make it more red to sew up other districts for Ds.  We had Malinowski for 2 terms before that.
Hi Tom, 

Let‚Äôs try to not make judgments about others, and be more astute and use fewer run-on sentences.

XXOO, 

Gary
If you ever knew people in school who were *VERY* obsessed with their image in school government, then later went to a political science school, they often have that same personality - almost unbelievably fake, and just really concerned about being ahead of everyone else
That's the spineless, feckless, complicit, weakness attitude the likes of Schumer and old-guard Dems/DINOS that ALLOWED MAGAts to steamroll the Constitution and is allowing Fascism to win! Take that ""Highroad"" crap and save it for the knitting circle and book-clubs! The rest of us would like to fight Nazis and Fascists!! Strongly worded letters have provided Republicans and MAGAts with enough Toilet Paper to last 5 lifetimes....time to fuck shit UP!!!
Ah, I missed the memo that we started negotiating with terrorists.
If by multiple elections you mean two and if ""literally zero effort"" means out spending Sue Altman with almost a million dollars of Elon Musks money (second largest recipient in Congress) then, respectfully, you would still be wrong. The fact is that the district was redistricted in 2022, which gave Republicans a greater advantage because it cut out some more left leaning areas. That is when Kean won the district. It really wasn't that long ago. He's literally only been our rep for less than three years. We certainly can vote him out. I did a lot of doorknocking for Sue Altman and Tom Malonowski, and I'll keep doing it. I know there are some MAGA Republicans in Warren but I'm in Hunterdon and most of the Republicans here aren't MAGA, they are just really rich people who hate taxes and don't care about the poor. Watching the stock market drop by 5 trillion dollars in two weeks might change some hearts and minds. Yeah, they voted for Trump and Kean, but not because they wanted to lose money.
That was before Republicans had the stage and all aspects of government to make fools of themselves on the daily.
I hope you're right and would be glad to be proven wrong.  
  
Kean, Van Drew, and Chris Smith have solid support. Smith doesn't even live in the state!
Why did we have to sacrifice Malinowski to protect Gottheimer of all people?
I don't know about that. Remember, Trump won in 2016. We're year 9 in this situation.
Republicans making fools of themselves on the daily didn't just start this year. Tom Kean has been a do-nothing for ages and we haven't managed to get rid of him.
Gottheimer is no fucking prize, I tell you!! It's hard enough to get any semblance of Blue Representation in North West NJ, so the idea of organizing a Primary to get his ass replaced with a Progressive with a Backbone, is a pipe-dream right now! Sussex County holds too many Boomers and Gen-Xers that are aligned with Rock-Chewing dumb-ass MAGAts, at the moment....but the silver lining is that their kids (my kids as well, as I am a younger Gen-X), are smarter and more enlightened and know better! NJ will always remain Blue despite the spit-screaming to the contrary, and it's the Millennials and Gen Z who will ""ratify"" it as a Blue State!! But we need the Old Guard DINOS to GTFO and replace them with people like my FAVORITE Congress Woman, Jasmine Crockett!! Oh boy how AMAZING would this Country be if we had a house full of Jasmine Crocketts?
Seniority
Maybe it had to do with Malinowski insider trading kind of focusing attention on the practice, even as Gottheimer is one of the principal adherents. Malinowski was a Obama functionary, and the party is trying to distance itself from that group because they believe that when the truth is known, nobody will ever vote Democrat again. I believe that with all of the releases of heretofore classified Materials people will have a very difficult time ever excepting anything that the Democrats push at them. The entire naming of urban prosecutorial offices as part of a plan is really sketchy"

Oh I have the perfect plan for you. Picture it, October 3rd. It‚Äôs like the last possible warm sunny Friday so you take the day off from work and take your kids ‚Äúpumpkin picking‚Äù in Bergen county- somewhere between Paramus and mahwah.

Spend some time with the local townies that live there and really chat them up. They love spending time with tourists. Wrap that all up with a Sunday morning drive back up the parkway to Newark liberty airport and really really get a good feel for terminal c, like buy a ticket and everything really soak it in. Don‚Äôt forget to get a souvenir $7 water and maybe a stale donut from a Dunkin‚Äô while you‚Äôre there. If you still have time, head over to rt 20 in Clifton to get the feel for how it is to live here like a regular‚Ä¶ make sure you go through the rt 23/46/80 interchange.

That fucking golf course in Bedminster.  I say we get rid of it.
For those that don't know. Alina haba got her job by interfering in a sexual assault lawsuit against the general manager of trumps bedminster golf club. 

This girl met Alina and they became ""friends"", Alina said that she would help with the lawsuit and she would give her some advice as a friend. And as a friend she told her to take a very bad settlement. One that would bind her from saying anything and would provide her very little compensation for the sexual assault that she experienced working as an employee at the club.

She did this so that she could demonstrate to Trump that she would do any underhanded back alley rat fuckery on his behalf. She demonstrates that she is a baseless and a moral sidewalk street scum.

If there were any kind of justice or fairness in this world, she would have had her law license revoked and I've been penalized to the fullest extent possible. What she did was not just wrong ethically as a lawyer but ethically indefensible as a human being, as a woman.

Alina is not just a failed lawyer. She is a failure of a human being, and we should do whatever it is that we can to make her life miserable in the great state of New Jersey.

Murphy is a lame duck governor, and his wife's political career lost steam. Why would he give a shit about what she says about him?

Trump National is a giant wetland violation; that the "" not at all corrupt "" Christie ( time for some traffic problems administration) buried.  So yes, let's talk about GOP AG's here in NJ.

Andy Kim has a seat because democrats looked beyond party and prosecuted corruption. Habba was appointed by a convicted Felon....  any claim to her legitimacy is comical.

Don‚Äôt forget 80 and 287
That‚Äôd be a waste. Let‚Äôs make it a public course.
I think her job will be to start bullshit investigations and file frivolous lawsuits against anyone and any organization that doesn't align with the Von Shitzenpants agenda.
I hope she finds out that while NJ is like any state when it comes to politics, for the most part NJ goes back and forth and hates our leadership no matter what letter is next to their name.
They‚Äôre dicks, but they‚Äôre *our* dicks
It's also a push to flip NJ red in general. They noticed how slim the margin was this election compared to years past.  The opportunity is certainly there, as painful as that is to say.

Name change experience in NJ (2025),"I changed my legal name this year and wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone else, as there seem to be a few points that either have changed recently or aren't mentioned in any of the available guides - including one major deviation that came as a complete surprise. I don't know if any of this differs by county, but for reference, I'm in Mercer.

Note that I filed electronically through the [JEDS system](https://www.njcourts.gov/self-help/jeds) and will be describing that process. If you file by mail or in person, obviously expect some differences.

**Overview:**

1. Fill out [this packet](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/10551_namechg_adult.pdf) and a [CIS](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/10517_ps_pkt.pdf)
2. File forms A, A-1, B, C, C-1, and CIS with the court and pay the $250 fee
3. Wait for communication (by email if filed through JEDS) from the court
4. Once you have your docket number, [associate yourself with the case](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/self-help/qrg-srlcjaccesstorestrictedcasesuserguide.pdf) (possibly optional, but quick and easy so you might as well)
5. Once you get the Order Fixing Date of Hearing (form B) filled out with your hearing date, print a copy and send it to the Division of Criminal Justice by certified mail w/ return receipt at least 20 days before the hearing
6. Once you get the return receipt back, combine a scan of it, form D, and a photo ID (eg. driver's license, passport) into one image/PDF and file it with the court
7. Wait for your hearing date
8. Attend the hearing, probably over Zoom (maybe? See below)
9. Once your name change is approved, file a [Records Request Form](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/10200_records_req.pdf) to order certified copies of the Final Judgment and addendum
10. Send a regular copy of the Final Judgment (just a printout and without the addendum) to the Division of Criminal Justice. No return receipt needed
11. Once you get your certified copies, use them to update your legal documents and whatever else you need. Done!

The whole court process from the initial filing to getting the certified Final Judgment in hand took just over 2 months for me.

**Notes/Tips:**

* First read through [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/wc3btw/changes_to_the_name_change_procedure_in_nj/). There's a ton of useful info there, especially for navigating JEDS. For the sake of brevity, I won't be repeating anything that went unchanged from there. Also check out these pages: [1](https://www.njcourts.gov/self-help/name-change/name-change-adults), [2](https://www.nj.gov/transgender/name-changes/step-by-step-guide.shtml), ([minors](https://www.njcourts.gov/self-help/name-change/name-change-minor))
* **#2**: You can pay through JEDS by credit/debit card or bank transfer. If paying by card, there's an additional fee of 3% ($7.50). If you can prove financial hardship, you may qualify for a [fee waiver](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/11208_filingfeewaiver.pdf).
* **#3**: You'll receive several emails from the court. The one you need to watch for is the one with the finalized Order Fixing Date of Hearing (email title ""NJ eCourts Order Hearing Result Notification""). I also received an email from a court service officer with a copy of the order, and they even sent a physical copy by mail as well. That part might differ by county.
* **#4**: Because name change cases are classified confidential now, you won't be able to access your case or documents through ecourts unless you ""associate yourself to the case"". Just follow the [instructions](https://www.njcourts.gov/sites/default/files/self-help/qrg-srlcjaccesstorestrictedcasesuserguide.pdf) and wait a few days to be approved. This turned out to be unnecessary for me since as mentioned in the previous point, you only really *need* to access the Order Fixing Date of Hearing and that was sent to me directly by both email and physical mail. But again, that could be county-dependent and the extra step doesn't hurt since you'll be waiting anyway.
* **#5**: If you have any pending criminal charges in NJ, you'll also have to send a copy of forms A, A-1, and B to the prosecutor of the county where the matter is being heard.
* **#8**: This was the big surprise. **I did not have a hearing.** Or rather, a hearing date was set, but I was instructed not to attend. Instead, the judge just signed the Final Judgment on the day and that was it. I have no idea if this is a county thing or a brand new standard policy or if there was something about my case specifically that caused them to waive the hearing; my best guess is that it's because my name change was for gender identity purposes, because someone else I spoke with who changed their name last year for the same reason said they had a hearing but just had to confirm their identity and weren't asked any further questions, while the other people there changing their names for different reasons (if I understood correctly, there were several name change cases being heard at the same meeting) did have to elaborate further. If anyone else has changed their name recently and doesn't mind sharing, I would be very curious to hear how this went for you.
* **#9**: Each copy is $25 and must be requested one at a time. If paying by card, there's an additional fee of 3% ($0.75). At least 3 copies are recommended (1 mailed to the Treasury Department, 1 mailed to the Office of Vital Statistics for your birth certificate, and 1 for driver's license, Social Security, passport, etc.), but I believe the Treasury copy, and maybe birth certificate too, will eventually be sent back to you, so you could probably get by with 2 and use the same one for both Treasury & birth certificate if you're patient. As it turned out, I was actually given a free copy by default (might be county-dependent), so I ended up with 4 because I'd already paid for 3 before I was told about that, lol.
* **#10**: This step doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere online, but it was in the follow-up email I was sent along with the info about that free copy.
* **#11**: Time-sensitive: driver's license (within 14 days of the judgment date; $11), Department of Treasury (within 45 days of the judgment date; $50), and Social Security (within 2 years, but I believe you can wait longer and you'll just have an extra step to do or something; free). Birth certificate doesn't have a deadline as far as I can find, and your passport can wait until your next renewal. Until then, you can just book plane tickets, etc. under your passport name and pack a copy of the Final Judgment when traveling just in case you need to explain a name discrepancy, such as when renting a car abroad with different names on your passport and license.
* You don't need to change SS before changing your license/ID, which is fortunate because it took 9 dates for my certified copies to arrive and the remaining 5 days included a weekend, leaving me only 3 days to get to the MVC. I ended up getting it done on the 14th day. I don't know what, if anything actually happens if you miss the 14-day mark, but yeah, be prepared to do that first.
* For any trans/nonbinary folks: if you're planning to change both your name and gender on your birth certificate, do them at the same time. If you do them together, you can do it online and certified copies are $6 for the first one + $2 for each additional copy. I changed my gender on my BC online last year and assumed I'd be able to do my name the same way later. Nope. Apparently you only qualify to use the online form if you're changing your gender marker. If you do your name separately, you have to 1) mail it in, and 2) pay $25 for the first certified copy instead of $6. Learn from my mistake and save yourselves some money and hassle.

I think that's about it. I'm currently in the process of changing my documents and everything and will update this post if I find anything further to note.",0.79,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jk2nfy/name_change_experience_in_nj_2025/,6,1jk2nfy,2025-03-26 03:29,"Appreciate the post! I'm on the same boat, though I'm changing my name due to immigration (fixing my first name and adding a middle name).

I will truly, never in my life, have the money for this.
Good luck!

I will say that I got the notification that I didn't have to show up around the same time as the email with the Order Fixing Date of Hearing. It was a separate email saying ""Do not come to the courthouse because no oral argument has been requested. The court's decision will be provided to you.""
My ex got his through a pro bono service but I believe they did special services for trans folks who needed name changes/gender markers. He was recommended by his endo. Didn‚Äôt have to pay anything.

Im probably just being pessimistic, i have more ability than some
You can file for a hardship thing with the court to have the fee waved, I could've but I didn't feel like waiting when I did it so I just paid it."
Unlawful Parking Ticket in Newark,"Hi!! need a bit of advice and help. On January 26th, I received a ticket in newark for parking in a bus lane. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt remember whether I was parked or not directly on the bus lane and did not take pictures either. 

My ticket did not have a fine, it said ‚ÄúCourt Appearance Required‚Äù So then I did some digging. 


The violation I received in the ticket was‚Äú23:4-2 - VIOLATION EXCLUSION BUS LANES‚Äù, I did some googling and found a website with all the official newark parking violations and for violation 23:4-2 it states the following, ‚ÄúBetween the hours of 6:30 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and
4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, the curb lanes beginning at Pennington Street, continuing in a northerly direction to Orange Street and from 315 feet south of the southerly curbline of Bridge Street, continuing in a southerly direction to Lincoln Park are hereby designated for bus usage only. No other vehicle may enter, stand or park in these lanes during these time periods, except as hereinafter provided‚Äù My ticket was given on a SUNDAY! Also I asked an officer about this and he said bus lanes don‚Äôt apply on weekends. Like am I good? 

I went to the newark court and scheduled a court hearing for April 2, but not sure what that entails can someone a) tell me if with the evidence I have works for disputing this ticket and b) if anyone has had a zoom court appearance can let me know what the process is like. 

PLS HELP! 

",0.33,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jk1nk7/unlawful_parking_ticket_in_newark/,1,1jk1nk7,2025-03-26 02:36,"You should be ok.  You are pleading ""not guilty"".  
When your case is called, the Municipal Prosecutor will ask you why you think you aren't guilty. 

Just calmly explain that this ticket was issued on a Sunday, (Sunday, January 26, 2025) - and the law cited in violation, 23:4-2 - VIOLATION EXCLUSION BUS LANES, specifically states that the restrictions are only in effect Monday-Friday.  
Because the law doesn't apply on Sunday, you cannot be guilty of violating it. 

The Prosecutor should agree with you, and allow you to tell the judge the same - and/or the Mun.Prosecutor should just ask to have the charge dropped.  

It should be just that easy. 

Just in case it isn't... 
If they start asking more questions or pushing for more info, that might mean they want to amend the charge.  Politely decline to answer more questions as much as you can.  If they want to change the charge, then ask them for a new court date and for the full ""discovery package"" including any officer notes, body cam, vehicle cam or other materials. They may instruct you to submit the request in writing - be clear on the details. 

I haven't done a Zoom hearing, but I have done Zoom jury.  Make sure you dress well enough - no t-shirt/pyjamas. No children or pets, no obvious drinking/eating while you wait.  Sit at your desk/chair waiting quietly & professionally just like you would if you were sitting in the courtroom.   If you *must* leave to use the toilet or something, have a note ready to put in front of your camera explaining that you'll be back in 3 minutes/ starting at ""time""."

Need Advice on Speeding Ticket in NJ ‚ÄºÔ∏è,"Hey everyone! I'm from California and recently visited New Jersey. While driving a rental car last week, I got pulled over and received a speeding ticket for exceeding the limit by 9 MPH. I explained to the officer that I was just following traffic, and there were other cars going even taster, but I still got the ticket.

I'm concerned about how this will affect my insurance. My license is only two years old, and I'm already paying a high premium-I don't want it to increase further.

What are my options? Is there a way to take traffic school to avoid points on my record? What's the best course of action?

legally speaking your reason for speeding is irrelevant. if you were speeding you were speeding. The fact that everyone else was too won‚Äôt absolve you of you take it to court.  

Your only hope would be that the Cop doesn‚Äôt show if you fight it. Since you‚Äôre from out of state that may be hard / impossible. 

So it seems like your only option is to just pay it. You don‚Äôt need to tell your insurance about it and they probably won‚Äôt find out anyway.
No idea but...

I got a ticket for running a red light in NYC (not a camera, pulled over) 6 years ago, and 2 years ago I got a speeding ticket in upstate NY (71 in a 55).  My insurance never went up. Both tickets in NY, I love in NJ. My insurance went up recently but that's bc the insurance companies are raising their rates out of scumbaggery. I'm 50 and these were my first tickets since 1995.
Do you have a friend in California that is or knows a police officer?  If so, ask them if tickets in NJ are reported to any agency in California.  If they are not reported, pay your fine and move on, or follow the suggestions of others here to reduce the charges / fine, etc., pay the fine and move on.  
  
I received a ticket a few years ago from Virginia.  Totally my fault and I confessed my sin to the officer - the speed got away from me, sorry, my fault...  He reduced the charges so I didn't have to show up in court to pay the fine - cut me a break.  I paid the fine online and never heard a word from NJ regarding the ticket.  
  
Good luck!!"
I‚Äôve been kinda half sick for like a week,Apparently there‚Äôs something going around. I don‚Äôt have allergies. What the hell is this? No fever. Mucusy. Heaviness in my chest.

I've been feeling it too but I'm allergic to tree pollen and some others that bloom later.
Dealing with some kind of upper respiratory infection since last Thursday. Started with sore throat, then nasal congestion/runny nose. Fatigue, and now a dry cough today. It suucckks
Same! Wtf?!

And I‚Äôve been taking meds, drinking tea and eating soups to fight it but this cold (?) keeps on. Scratchy throat, runny nose and a bit of fatigue (probably from poor sleep due to clogged nose). It‚Äôs not enough for me to call out from work but enough for people at work to notice I‚Äôm not right. 

Hope we get better soon because feeling like this sucks!
I had the same thing, went to my doctor he said something was going around. I was better by the time I saw my doctor so he couldn't test to see what it was. But he recommended, Mucinex and and flonase spray.

I had a really bad fever though along with the other stuff you wrote.
You're sick
Something is definitely going around. Mine started as a sore throat, runny nose, and general fatigue. I thought maybe it was the aftereffects of the long weekend and traveling (St. Patties). Then I contracted conjunctivitis from a pair of contact lenses that I should‚Äôve thrown out sooner. Went to urgent care, they ruled out strep and gave me antibiotic eye drops. I shit you not, that night, while I was laying in bed, my phone fell and landed directly on my eye socket. Now, I am healing from a black eye as well. Yesterday, I stepped on my foot wrong and gave myself a slight sprain. I‚Äôm having a hell of a week! Lol!
For some reason when I wake up, EVERY MORNING NOW, I have YELLOW clump phlegm. I'm like the hawk tuah girl when I first wake up. It's so nasty. But only when I first wake up.
I had that last week! Started on Monday and went away on Thursday. Took two covid/flu tests and came out negative so idk what it was.
Yea sorry that was me.... I got you sick with ligma.
It's covid, there are no rules in place anymore so everyone is working sick. I work in different offices doing repairs and one I went into the other day had like three people there because every one else was sick and the people that were there were all coughing and sneezing. Guess who had a 101.5 fever the next day and also tested positive?
Husband has a URI that‚Äôs been going on for a few days now. It‚Äôs probably covid.
You people make these kinds of posts everyday
Did yall forget about covid or
Covid never went away and continues to mutate. Trump put a gag order on health organizations weeks ago
Did you take a Covid test. Still prevalent always, but now it's on the rise in NJ

You can look at the wastewater for the location closest to you. Also besides Covid can see a whole host of wastewater readings like Flu, RSV, norovirus,etc. This is wastewater filtered to just NJ

Tested flu,Covid, no sent out for viral testing because cough was so bad. Adenoid virus undetermined type  might be new Covid type, got conjunctivitis with it, 2 weeks of coughing
Bacterial Pneumonia.
Same days for me, tested positive for covid the other day, pretty simple to check with an at-home test if you want
~mask up all the time everyone~ *wet fart sound*
I have the same thing. Thought it was an upper respiratory infection and turned out to be the flu. Do yourself a favor and go to the Dr
I had the same exact thing last week and I think it's allergies. I took Claritin and it helped a lot and when I went away for work midweek, it cleared up but came right back when I got home. I think there must be a tree or mold or something I'm allergic to.
My co worker son had these symptoms. He is using a nebulizer.
I had a pretty mild cold 2 weeks ago that took forever for the congestion to go away. I never felt run down, just had a loose stuffy nose (if that makes sense lol) and it was runny. Which is do embarrassing as an adult. This week my 10 year old just has a cough. Hasn‚Äôt had any other symptoms ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
They make home tests that will test you for Covid, flu an and flu b. Try them.
(You might need 3 tests 36 hours apart.)
RSV like the rest of the state
Had what I thought was a mild sinus infection for like a week and it turned into full blown sick for like 4 days. 102 fever, headaches‚Ä¶etc. went to the doctor, they started me on antibiotics and it cleared up within 2 days of starting them. Something nasty is going around, see a doctor if possible.
I would get check, I mean I had bronchitis and it‚Äôs the worse. If you have a lot of mucus drainage paired with that heaviness in the chest I would go to a doctor. My shit didn‚Äôt clear up for 3 weeks.
If you drink alcohol and/or smoke or vape, this definitely will impact your respiratory system. When I do, I get incredibly stuffed and mucusy and short of breath.
Same, OP. Though, I still have a cough that‚Äôs lasted for a month (still have it rn actually.) I went to the dr.‚Äòs and they said it‚Äôs not an infection (got tested) so kinda confused what it is rn‚Ä¶ wondering if I actually have allergies but I‚Äôm not sneezing, just coughing a bunch though.
Started this afternoon at work. Lawd help me
Same here,, started as a cold, went to my chest.  Been hacking up loogies for 3 weeks.  I went on antibiotics but I don't think they did anything. Slowly getting better day by day but still not 100%,, been hovering in the 85-90% range for a while.
Same here. Started on Monday. Right now it's dry coughs
AIDS
SAME!!! And the same re: allergies because I got a test last year (the stabby one, up n down the arm) confirming I‚Äôm only slightly allergic to like ragweed or something. 

It has felt like the end or beginning of a cold or upper respiratory thing that I never had or fully get for so long. Plus waking up drenched in sweat for no reason from time to time?? Sore throat or ears aching etc but inconsistently enough to be copay worthy lol 

 Feels like I‚Äôm getting too used to feeling semi shitty at all time at this point bc I don‚Äôt recall the last time I didn‚Äôt.
Wait I was hanging out in SJ on Friday (live in Philly) and I‚Äôve had this too! I was chalking it up to allergies (I get allergy induced asthma) but thought it was weird that Allegra wasn‚Äôt doing much, plus I didn‚Äôt get the itchy eyes/runny nose

Symptoms: FATIGUE, vaguely scratchy throat, chest heaviness/shortness of breath Sunday-Monday, dizziness, stuffy and mucusy, general malaise. Covid negative. Allegra seemed to treat the chest symptoms but not much else
Adult onset allergies are a thing.
Me too. Cough is brutal.
Did you do the triple test for both flus and Covid?

This was me, circa early February, and it was Flu A that then progressed into a bacterial infection, possibly pneumonia (but I didn't go for the x-ray), and was resolved with Augmentin. 

Note, Augmentin was started three weeks after first onset of symptoms

Recap 14 days ill, 36 hours feeling on the mend, 4 days getting worse, then started abx
I had similar, just no fatigue 2 weeks ago
I tested positive Monday for the flu with the same exact symptoms. Feel better
Same symptoms for me as well. Day 6, the dry coughs hurt the most
Why are you wasting a doctors time if you're recovering?

SAME. Well it‚Äôs better now but I‚Äôve been like on the verge of getting sick for a few nights over 1-2 weeks but during the day it‚Äôs been fine. Luckily that has now passed too but people in my office are having similar symptoms. It‚Äôs like a mild mild pre-cold.
I thought it was Dee
Joe who?
Covid has a multiple day incubation period, you were already infected when you went to that office.
You simply don‚Äôt have enough information to make that claim with any level of confidence

So you're saying it's not possible that the most contagious disease of our lifetime that shut down the entire world for multiple years is still aggressively spreading, in the most densely populated state in the country after a return to office with no more restrictions to prevent it from spreading, and I just personally tested positive and so did my entire wife's workplace. Where does your confidence come from? You're claiming no so where's your evidence? Just being a contrarian?
it‚Äôs the post of people self validating that what they have is going around. for example, now i‚Äôm confident that my excessive drinking , copious marijuana use , and unprotected sex with hookers behind a wendy‚Äôs dumpster is unrelated to my condition, but is just something that is going around

honestly. depends where you are. They're more of a central/west jersey chain, but Franks makes a wide variety of pie types and every time I've strayed off the traditional NY style its always been good. If you got one nearby and they offer it I'd try them
Two options, take the path to the West Village and go to Emmett's. Totally legit true Chicago deep dish.
An unconventional alternative is lions & tigers & squares on 23rd. It's Detroit style but not as thick and fluffy and the cheese is under the toppings. It scratched the deep dish itch pretty well. 
Other than those two I have not had any luck.
Bread Parmigiana
Sir we call that lasagna
oo i'll definitely try both, thanks for the recommendations
If you don‚Äôt want a crappy chain, go blue steel in Bloomfield
Detroit style pizza has the toppings on top. It goes crust, cheese, sauce, then other toppings. It uses brick cheese. And is cooked in a special type of pan.
I am in just because of the name
That's Detroit style not Chicago deep dish 

But so good
I'll try uno and blue steel. they both look good. i'm not picky just wanted to try some different style pizza"

Parking is also easier to find and those that are just traveling through have an easier time. I'll pay 5 dollars more if I can cut 30 minutes out of my trip. 

Our infrastructure is shit. The fact that a few sinkholes are backing up traffic and adding at times 1+ during rush hrs is evident of a failed transportation (or lack of) system. 

They sold us the ""having a car is real freedom"" bs
Congestion pricing doesn‚Äôt keep me from driving in Manhattan, it‚Äôs the $45 parking spots.  

With that said, I took the bus & subway yesterday to Irving Plaza, $25 a head, still cheaper than parking/tolls/gas or kw.
Yeah. The gaslighting that it hurts the common man is total bs. Every daily commuter I know has taken mass transit long before congestion pricing so they don‚Äôt care. In fact they benefit also because the buses move faster with less cars on the road.
I‚Äôd still 100% take the train from - where is that, South Orange? Maplewood?
The top of your screenshot says 1914 which is 7:14pm, not 6pm‚Ä¶
Or we can go back to remote work for jobs that can be done from home rather than the office which made the biggest difference in relieving congestion and helping our environment.
I live in Manhattan but go home to my parents‚Äô in NJ a lot and i am absolutely obsessed with congestion pricing. It is like GD magic.
I love congestion pricing
Congestion pricing is basically a miracle, so naturally the worst fucking people want to undo it.
I just made it from Middle Village, Queens to Montclair, NJ in 40 minutes leaving around 8pm. That was a new record.
No way you are driving through Hudson County with no traffic. Congestion pricing made it better, but not that blue.
I can tell you that I commute through the Lincoln tunnel 2x a week.  In January it was good but now it‚Äôs back to the same bullcrap.  Long commute.  I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs working except to grab money.

I also drive the main rush aka 8:30am not heading in during the evening.
For a second I thought these were uber prices.

Then I remembered that this is 2025 and $22 is the price of two cartons of eggs.
Sinkholes: Allow us to introduce ourselves
all hail congestion pricing
Hell yeah it's definitely working. The last few times I went to the city it's been 30 min quicker at least. I traveled from Hackensack to Midtown **and** found street parking all within 30 min. It's phenomenal.
i love congestion pricing, traffic has definitely decreased when driving into NY and even on my local streets (live just off the bridge near 46) plus, finding paeking has been so much better when i do drive out, it's amazing!
Checking right now at 5pm and it's over an hour.

Your screenshot is after 7pm, not at 6 btw.

Is that avoiding 139?  139 to Holland Tunnel continues to be a shit show.  I take 139 every morning at 8a and it's as much as a shit show as it has ever been.  Over the last several weeks, it's even backed up into the 1/9 southbound that it's actually increased my commute about 15-30 mins.  I don't know where people are getting all these time savings, but I haven't found an alternative to 139 that would get me through that bottleneck quicker.  Side streets in JC would be worst.

I tried 495 to the Lincoln once and screw that. I will say that it doesn't spill into 95 as much but holy crap 495 to Lincoln at 750a is another shit show however I scrapped that attempt after a few times and went back to taking the 1/9 to 139.

I keep reading about the time savings, but I have not seen much of it at all with the roads leading to the tunnels.
I thought the Gov talked to big orange and the congestion pricing was going away?  What's the latest?
Is this why my commute was so easy? I don‚Äôt even commute into NYC, but I go north.
MAPSO üíØüíØüíØ
Well, driving is a privilege, not a right. If the roads were private, it'd cost more
The problem lies for those who can't afford the congestion pricing increase but can't rely on the shitty public transit we have going into the city. 

Not to mention things in the city getting really expensive since it costs even more for trucks. Or like someone above commented, raising their prices to be able to afford  the congestion tax.

This area is suffocating in cost anyways, no need to add more to it.
It‚Äôs the best!
I love Montclair
I wonder how much the congestion price is affecting their economy with fewer people traveling.
‚Äú6pm‚Äù meaning 7:15pm. I can guarantee the congestion pricing didn‚Äôt make traffic worse, but pretending it is some 45 minute savior during rush hour is laughable (saying this as a poor schmuck that has to drive around for a sales job)
I think congestion pricing stoped NEW YORKERS who drove to work in the congestion zone from driving. Many who must drive from Jersey still do. I‚Äôm always surprised by how many New Yorkers have cars
$46 in tolls
it's after rush hour you moron, of course it's not that bad
Wow..congestion pricing impact thing or not I‚Äôd  have expected far longer tbh. Takes me that long from one end of 1&9 to the other anytime, any day, always‚Ä¶lol 

I don‚Äôt much about what it entails (bc as I said above I try not to use my car EVER as it‚Äôll be at least 20 mins no matter where I‚Äôm going) but moreso bc I live in JC and would never think or need to drive into the city. Prob why I pay 15k in property taxes for an apartment ‚Ä¶but i digress ‚Ä¶.

Can I ask..was this meant to help with traffic here at all?? I mean, was it supposed to?? It didn‚Äôt.  At least in the JC area (when not trying to go into the city I mean‚Äîso not on holland or Lincoln approach roads aka the  HELL ON EARTH roads)?? I have seen no difference but maybe others have?

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is how does this help us locals, if it was ever supposed to?

PS WHO DOWNVOTES THIS????  Rude AF. Stay your ass on NJT then!! If you dealt with what we do from non locals without batting an eye you‚Äôd  be in uproar!! FOH with all that. My community matters too.
What? Op is delulu. Congestion toll has zero to do with that commute, at that time.¬†


I've been commuting to the city for decades at this point. Unless you have years of experience you shouldn't be giving advice.¬†
MAJOR REASON WHY I WANT OUT ASAP! Life long Bergen county resident hereüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èhate it! For many reasons, some being:

1. Insanely high living cost 
2. Insanely high population density 
3. People here are just MEAN dude ! (Especially here in north Jersey, where everyone is in a rush n competing for the same limited resources and proccupied in ‚Äúkeeping up with the Jones‚Äôs and either flat out ignore you or treat you differently because you‚Äôre dressed a certain way or they don‚Äôt perceive you as ‚Äúattractive‚Äù or ‚Äúworth‚Äù their time üòí)

 Many more where that came from , and believe me I am very much aware of myself and my surroundings. I‚Äôm not unclean or even ugly lol. But the shalllowness of people are astounding. Not being cocky, many people tell me on a daily basis that I am  very beautiful,so I‚Äôm not gassing myself up. But I notice a BIG DIFFERENCE when people see me dressed nice, hair done, etc my expensive jewelry n purses( not better than anyone but I don‚Äôt wear anything fake ) and the brand new BMW I drive . Compared to when I‚Äôm just casually rolling around in sweats maybe in a store n literally get flat out ignored or rudely addressed , IF they even address me at all. SMH it‚Äôs just so FAKE! I genuinely feel so sorry for the people who are not as fortunate as I am , financially and physically. I can only imagine how they must feel day in and day out around these  super wealthy, super arrogant , selfish people that have a superiority complex and think they‚Äôre Gods gift to the world üôÑ. Sorry for the rant lol üòÜ and now on to the original post about traffic congestion. Which I believe is due to population. It‚Äôs OUT OF CONTROL! Thank god I work nights and don‚Äôt have to fight with the sheer amount of cars and morons on the road during peak hours! The only time I do go out during peak hours is to do something important that I cannot change and don‚Äôt have a choice . If it‚Äôs not that important, I‚Äôm  staying home! Not dealing with it! I‚Äôm 27 and these people are going to give me a stroke or heart attack because they blow my blood pressure through the roof ‚¨ÜÔ∏è! lol üòÜ seriously though I can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs awful, if I didn‚Äôt live with my elderly grandparents to help them financially and physically I WOULD‚ÄôVE BEEN OUT OF HERE AGES AGO! But unfortunately my grandmother hates change and due to many other things that need too long of an explanation to go into , she doesn‚Äôt want to move . Only recently has she become more open . My grandfather has been wanting to move from the area for years now, so at least we‚Äôre on the same page and see the lightüòÜ. But what the crazy lady wants she gets ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ we all seriously do love each other immensely, and want to stay together as a family unit , but I feel your pain OP! But I am glad you have seen a change! Hey anything helps right ! Hope for everyone‚Äôs sake we create and have access to reliable alternatives and solutions to commute. We need to be able to maintain and manage the infrastructure in this country in general. Hopefully we are moving in the right direction!
All because of the ‚ÄúAmerican dream‚Äù of owning a car. Making public transport = communism HIGH TAXES BAD. TRAINS AND BUS BAD. CAR = FREEDOM. CAR GOOD.
Taxed by simply owning it. Everyone has a car which leads to ultimate congestion around bottlenecks.
You mean South Jersey
I think a lot about this ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù every six months when my insurance premiums go up, and annually when I pay the state for my freedom
My friend lives in Wharton and works in central Jersey. Coming home the other day he sat in traffic for 3 hours due to all the sink hole stuff.


Problem is we don‚Äôt have any trustworthy politicians to do the right thing because there‚Äôs infinitely more money to be made by their donors by having more people reliant on cars and stimulating the various industries that have more to gain by public transit being as dysfunctional as it is.

Would practically  take coup to fundamentally change anything and done the right way and not this feet drag, pocket the money and service still sucks nonsense.
Before they figured how to milk us of all our disposable income when we had more for cars .

That sick part of this is , is it was by design - they allowed standard oil to sabotage American infrastructure to FORCE car use and we never recovered . Take half our military budget and switch it to infrastructure and education and we are the smartest country on par with other countries great transit systems.
I don't drive into Manhattan that often, but the few times that I do, I found it pretty easy and cheap to just use street parking which I found had a ton more spots open than where I park near my apartment in Jersey City. Just curious, is there a reason for using these garages over street parking that I'm missing?
I drive my work van from central jersey to Manhattan every single day. I can now wake up 30-45 min later on a daily basis and still get to my jobs 15-30 min earlier. It has made such a difference in my life. Plus I just increased my prices to compensate for the pricing
yeah SOMA. if i was by myself i‚Äôd train it too. but with a toddler it‚Äôs a pain the ass to switch trains and deal with the subway
Imagine commuting this fast in 1914
Yeah the entire rush hour is over. No shit it didnt take them long LOL
edit: 6pm timing today is 56 mins, so 9 minutes slower
yeah i know, i was checking the times since 5pm on and off to get a sense of what the traffic was gonna be like when i make this trip tomorrow. so it‚Äôs a trust me bro but i‚Äôll post another screenshot tomorrow at 6pm if ya want
Real state investors were bleeding money so it'll never happen again even if we have another full blown pandemic
Me too
I can get from Bergenfield to the East village for seeing bands in 25-30 minutes since congestion pricing started and street parking is wide open now
Yeah like our own governor¬†
Its 8pm... unless there's an event , smooth sailing¬†
78 over the bridge to the holland tunnel is the best route hands down.
It‚Äôs just 78. I just did basically this same drive last Friday around 3pm and was shocked at how quickly I breezed straight into JC.

The hardest part about this particular drive used to be dealing with the BQE more than anything in Jersey. Congestion pricing has largely eliminated that by opening up the route across lower Manhattan
at 6pm today it was 56 mins
$24.91
Nothing. It‚Äôs an empty threat.¬†
> The problem lies for those who can't afford the congestion pricing increase but can't rely on the shitty public transit we have going into the city.

These are fictional people.

Owning and operating a vehicle, driving it INTO the city then paying for parking in the city, then do it all in reverse - EVERY FUCKING DAY - has always been more costly than simply taking P.T. 

SO either you *can* afford the increase, because you're already living large able to waste all that money on gas and car maintenance just to move between 2 points every 8 hours *and contribute to the problem*...

or you've been taking P.T. the whole time
Pedestrian traffic is up in the Congestion zone so it doesn't appear to be affecting people traveling into City.   The Sidewalks were spilling into the streets in the Village last weekend...which is a bit unusual for this time of year..
Sorry its very hard to pin down what your actual question is.

is it 

>How does congestion pricing eliminate traffic for me if I live literally inside one of the biggest hubs to transit into the single most popular city on the eastern seabord?

Because the answer to that question is: it makes the lines less long, but you can only fix *that* problem by abandoning driving a car and/or moving.
Don't forget the fuel, tires, repairs, storage, parking, stress...
A 30 minute Costco run (the one in Wharton is close to my work), took me about 45 minutes to get back to rt 15.
 Because the rabble/mob would go after any politician for simply telling the average American they really shouldn't be single commuting in their 18ft 7 passenger SUV everyday, the reaction is no different than taking drugs away from a addict.  Manhattan has now been fighting a secret war against cars for decades either by making the lanes narrower, eliminating TONS of parking, closing avenues, and a big one: not enforcing traffic so the commuters basically screw themselves over with things of their own making like gridlock, commute times had gone way up, etc. But none of that worked because humans are pretty dumb and can't see the writing on the wall, people just sat in traffic for 3 hours instead of 2 and were fine with it. Now finally congestion pricing has shown how badly these people needed to drive to work by themselves, i.e. most absolutely had other options but simply chose not to. Anyway, here we are, if you really need to go somewhere with your car in NYC now it's far more of pleasant experience, worth the cost to get rid of all the unnecessary vehicles.
Elon Musk, the savior of environment with his EVs and tunnels, purposely embellished his goals to get funding and sabotaged California high speed rail. Car companies bought out all street cars in SF to force people to buy their cars. Koch brothers had a barrage of ads and mailers telling Texans that having high speed rail would make their taxes go up in multitudes. We (in NJ) have given billions of dollars in subsidies to oil companies, but the whole GOP goes up in arms if we try to put a train station in Andover.
Mostly for security. I‚Äôve had windows smashed or slashed (jeep soft top) even when the doors are unlocked to look for change or what ever else.  I‚Äôve also had bumpers and doors whacked from people who can‚Äôt drive or park without tapping other cars. 

The other reason is convenience, to street park near your destination in a well lit area isn‚Äôt always possible.  I also have a $70 parking ticket for street parking where I thought it was marked as legal‚Ä¶sometimes a garage just makes sense.
I mean, yeah. That's how it's done. That's how valuing people's time is supposed to work.
I drive through manhattan frequently for work (unfortunately) and these 45 min savings you claim are BS. Some days I save 15 mins, others there is no difference. Make sure to charge those NY cucks an extra $50 in exchange for your $9 toll though, because why the fuck not? They brought this on themselves.
If we had a robust public transportation, I'm sure we would have been able to solve this issue and make it easier for people like you to travel, less anxiety & stress. Cheaper/free as well.
What's SOMA mean?
How old? My little dude LOVES the trains. NJ Transit, subways, light rail, you name it. Now half the outings we take aren‚Äôt even about the destination, but what new trains he gets to ride. 

We took him to the city today and dude, I swear there‚Äôs more traffic on South Orange Ave than downtown Manhattan now. Streets were quiet and lovely. 

Glad it‚Äôs making your life easier as well!
That would have shown the Kaiser a thing or two!
T66 turbos w/ NOS and Motec exhausts on the Model T

Is that not worth 45 minutes of your time?
What about me? I have to be there before any trains can land me there. And I make enough to still make the ny commute worth it..but not enough that I can just willy nilly afford another few hundred more dollars in tolls every month¬†


...they exist man. Congestion toll is bullshit¬†
everyone knows that all those trade and construction guys are living big time
But that could be related to an event. It's how traffic over time changes is what matters.
lol fair and tbh I thought the same as I wrote it, but youd think that if less ppl were driving into the city it‚Äôd impact local traffic at least a little bit right? Meaning less instances of ppl cutting thru  through our local streets to get closer to the tunnel??  There are ways to do so. Idk how much diff it makes in the end but there are ways to get slightly closer to the entrance to the tunnel via local roads) even if to make the drive less annoying 

I‚Äôd have thought I‚Äôd notice at least a slight difference as I live on a ‚Äúshortcut road‚Äù.  That only makes sense right? So I‚Äôm not sure if I support, am against, or even care about congestion pricing as someone who lives here but then again no one asked us nor does our opinion factor in / is ever considered when arguing for or against this. We are used to it all, anyway. Now if it was impacting parking that‚Äôd be a whole other story. 

But no one considered what we think or how it might help or not help us. Yes,  know what I signed up for believe me lol..I‚Äôm used to it and won‚Äôt leabe bc of it. Burbs are NOT an option for me. I‚Äôm from morris but I‚Äôm  here 20 years now.! 

But this is a thing with strong reactions for or against ‚Ä¶and has been a constant topic of debate but never factored us in, seems weird right? Not even a mention from the ppl in charge, a small sound bite even, as to how it benefits local communities as an argument for how it‚Äôs a good thing for us too‚Ä¶? Why were we overlooked entirely when this is where we live? Feels fucked up a bit no one ever gave a thought about us or feels like we were slighted. It impacts us just as much as the folks who will be paying the prices that don‚Äôt LIVE here but ‚Äúwho cares‚Äù ??

Your post was the first one to make me feel like maybe I‚Äôm for this vs against vs give shit at all. 

Ps you seem cool so if ya want the tips n tricks local road stuff or how to park here if u wanted to path it vs full drive from time to time ‚Ä¶i gotchu
just don‚Äôt tell anyone else üòú
I agree but the general point I'm getting at is we still have an absolute mockery for public transit and nothing in tangible reach to have something more modernized even with these measures in  play and stuff being on a saner track. 

It would take more than just blind trust of things to fall in place when we've had the can kicked down the road for so long.
Damn dude who shit in your cereal? And sure if you wanna say they‚Äôre bs you can I don‚Äôt give a shit
South Orange/Maplewood. If you have to ask, it means you‚Äôre paying less in property taxes than us!
Same with my littlest, but sometimes it depends how time sensitive the trip is and the time of day.

Lived in Jersey City for ages, and on Sundays (pre-congestion pricing), if we went into the city with the whole family (2 kids + 2 adults) for a Central Park picnic or to visit a museum, it was cheaper to just to drive to the Upper West Side, find street parking, and schlepp around from there. We had to leave before 10.30, though. After that, street parking could be difficult to find.
Idk what's going on I was just answering bc she asked
Technically only the extra $9 would be the cost of the additional time
He still has to get home
PATH is 24/7. Nothing stopping you from parking in Newark or Harrison and taking the train. Not to mention that the congestion fee is like $2 in those early AM hours. So you‚Äôre either lying about not being able to afford it or are just too lazy to figure it out and take a train and want to bitch about it.¬†
Is someone *forcing you* to work that job and live where you live?
Charge their customers more then, just pass the cost on. They control their own prices
I walked from Delancy n Essex to Hudson Yards , every street was packed with people.   It felt like May in terms of crowd sizes , transit was also more crowded then normal.
Show your face downvoter! What‚Äôs the problem anyway? I‚Äôm just saying ..must be nice your lives were considered in all this but not once have ours, when our taxes are comparable if not higher, than commuters are, that‚Äôs all, so KMA, yuppie!!  May you get a flat in the tunnel!!

(Not u OP, and no need to respond to me again but ty for indulging the first commentlol)
NYC shit in my cereal with a congestion tax that did almost nothing to improve my life and now costs more. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre charging more for whatever you do, I would love everyone in NYC to eat more than the cost of their new toll.
When did this become a thing, this feels like in the later 2000s when realtors just started liberally calling a lot of things East Williamsburg when it definitely wasn‚Äôt.

I used to live not far from either place and I legit never heard the mashup used.
Thanks!
If you have to ask it means you‚Äôre not some geek that wishes they still lived in NYC
I'm laying facts. The toll full price after 5am. Simmer down.¬†
Obviously we should be basing regional transit policy around this one guy‚Äôs commute
My cousin got married in the late aughts and it was a thing at her wedding (one side was from Maplewood and the other South Orange)... That said, I know some Maplewood peeps who call it MapSo, which I actually like better. I feel like it rolls off the tongue more nicely and doesn't make me think of Brave New World.

How are we supposed to feel safe when the cops can‚Äôt even write a fair accident report?,"So my father on the way back home making a left on Grand Ave, gets hit by a car at a stop sign.

I‚Äôm tired of these crooked cops wherever I go. Why even bother becoming a cop if you‚Äôre going to discriminate.

This isn‚Äôt the first time experiencing a dirty cop. Filed a complaint before and nothing happens except for some remorse from coworkers when they hear who the complaint is for. The reason for filing a report was because my father way assaulted and battered by an off duty cop. The officer who wrote the report was at the scene and refused to write up a report. Instead yelled at my dad to walk to the hospital or go home if he isn‚Äôt hurt. He had obvious injury from being body slammed.

Which of the pictured cars is yours and who has the stop sign (is it all way or only two direction)?

If the diagram is incorrect you can do a change NJTR1 form but otherwise if the diagram is correct the insurance companies will make the correct determination.
OK, first, I have no clue where ""grand ave"" is, as I'm in Monmouth County.  So I already suspect this may be a case of ""everyone around here does this, but the law doesn't actually agree""

I finally figured where Grand Ave is, and there's no way for your dad to make a left turn onto Grand Ave anywhere near this picture where HE didn't have a stop sign.

In the photo you posted, if he is the Acura in the photo facing oncoming traffic, he either made a left ONTO Grand Ave from Edsall Ave, where he had the stop sign, or he was making a left from Grand Ave onto Edsall, where he has to yield to oncoming traffic.  

Where was his vehicle struck?
You have the right to write your own [accident report](https://www.nj.gov/transportation/refdata/accident/selfreporting.shtm).  You can even write your own complaints (""tickets"") to other drivers - as long as you have the evidence and you show up in court to provide it. 

There is no legal requirement for the police to write a report - just for you to notify them. 

You can write your own reports in addition to any reports that the police write (or not). 

Talk to a lawyer. Complaints to the department are just one way to do things. If your dad was harmed or his rights were violated, then you need to get a lawyer involved.
>Why even become a cop if you're going to discriminate.

Boy do I have some bad news for you.
Who says we're supposed to feel safe?
Sure. Majority of Grand Ave has no stop signs. All the roading that connecting to Grand Ave have stop signs. Only exceptions are where there are traffic lights. The car in the picture is my dad‚Äôs car. He was making a left from Grand Ave. The stop sign is for drivers who enter Grand Ave. So no stop signs for him but a stop sign for the other driver. He also didn‚Äôt make a sharp turn. The picture is taken where he got hit. The vehicle wasn‚Äôt moved until the cop told him to. The other driver moved her car immediately.
You perked my interest. What municipality?
He was on Grand ave going south bound, turning left to go east bound ONTO Edsall. The other driver was traveling west on Edsall where the stop exists. She tried to make a right onto Grand ave to go north.
We got a lawyer the same day just in case. The case manager is a former cop so said he will talk to the officer who wrote the report. Still people with authority shouldn‚Äôt do this.
Where was the point of impact?
The front driver side door. I got my dad a lawyer and the case manager says it's should be 50/50 at the worst case scenario but it should really be 100% fault by the other driver.

My real complaint is, the whole thing was biased. One thing I left out is that the officer wouldn't even let my speak his side. When it was his turn he literally just nodded and didn't ask him any questions. While the other driver who was a very young female had the officers attention for the majority of the time. Even 2 more units came and the focus was all on the female.

If I am to think positive about the situation for them to do this, is because she was most likely a high school student and they wanted to comfort her as much as possible. I practically saw the whole situation post accident because I was visiting my dad with my son and he lives like 20 feet away from the accident."
Can anyone recommend a traditional Chinese medicine pharmacy near Edison?,"Hi all! Can anyone recommend a good TCM pharmacy that gives herbal prescriptions? I‚Äôm currently trying to look for relief outside of western practices as it hasn‚Äôt helped me much.

We just got a high bacteria beach closing and it‚Äôs not even summer,"Swimming won‚Äôt be allowed at a riverside beach this summer after high bacteria levels were found in the water.

Beachwood Borough officials are considering the future of Beachwood Beach located on the Toms River, according to officials. the beach closed early last summer after persistently high levels of bacteria were found in the water.

Susan Minock, borough‚Äôs administrator and municipal clerk, told NJ Advance Media the borough has not yet decided if the beach will be closed ‚Äúfor good.‚Äù

The municipal beach is near a borough park and features a pier extending several feet into the river. A row of riverside homes and The Toms River Country Club are located on the opposite bank of the river.

Concerns about water quality surfaced in July after the Ocean County Department of Health tests showed unsafe bacteria readings. In a statement last summer, officials said the decision to ban swimming was made ‚Äúfor the safety, health and welfare of the residents and others.‚Äù",0.96,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jjumsy/we_just_got_a_high_bacteria_beach_closing_and_its/,12,1jjumsy,2025-03-25 21:17,"It‚Äôs a cove that traps bacteria.

There is most likely an illegal sewer connection or connections putting sewage into the river.  You should call the NJ DEP and see if they will send an inspector up there to scope out the problem.
Definitely insane runoff coming from the country club
Beachwood beach is closed almost every year for this reason. This is not unusual.
I crack up every time i hear ""Toms River Country Club"" and try and picture it in my mind.
That water has been dirty forever. I grew up in the Wood and went to a summer day camp at Mayo Park. We swam in the river on the reg but it was often closed too.¬†
I believe this happened last year on the same beach as well if I‚Äôm not mistaken
We used to swim in it all the time in the 80s and 90s as kids, but I don‚Äôt remember if they were testing back then. I used to spend hours in that river and don‚Äôt even like getting off the boat now lol.
Toms River people could afford building an oyster farm to filter out all the nastiness.. but I'd prefer they deal with an extreme level of bacteria.
I wish there was more info on why this is happening, 2 years of full season closures is wild
I have a boat at a local marina there and that area always seems to have some kind of no swimming alert by mid summer. The river does slow down around the two sides there by the TRCC
It‚Äôs actually a beautiful piece of property on the river.

Soiled by a gaggle of red hat wearing old a$$hats."
Indian Restaurants in NJ Are Way Too Expensive for What You Get‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs Going On?,"Has anyone else noticed how Indian restaurants in NJ have gotten ridiculously pricey lately? I‚Äôm talking $25-32 for butter chicken and naan, which is creeping up to what you‚Äôd pay for sushi or a fancy French dish‚Äîexcept those spots usually feel like fine dining with way better service. Meanwhile, a plate of pasta or a burger still runs $15-20, and Thai or Mexican can be even cheaper at $12-16, often with bigger portions. Indian meals used to be a budget-friendly gem, but now it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre charging premium prices for mediocre vibes and slow service.  
On top of that, I‚Äôve heard some of these places pay their staff mostly students peanuts, like way below minimum wage, which is sketchy and probably illegal. You‚Äôd think with these prices they could afford decent wages and step up the experience, but it‚Äôs still cramped tables and takeout vibes half the time. Is this just an NJ thing, or are Indian spots everywhere jacking up prices without matching the quality? Anyone got insights or a spot that‚Äôs still worth the money?


Edit: Yeah, I‚Äôll give it that inflation and costs are up, no denying it. Wages, supplies, rent, it‚Äôs a mess. But come on, some of these  spots are charging insane prices for straight up mediocre food. They're not just ‚Äòcovering costs,‚Äô that‚Äôs taking the piss. Appreciate the recs from folks here, though some sound worth a try, others might be a trek from my spot, so we‚Äôll see. Thanks for the heads up either way!

The only thing thats still worth it is lunch/dinner buffet if you know the right spots
Not sure where you're located, but there's one in central jersey, in East Brunswick called Bollywood Tadka. Prices have always been reasonable and I always have enough for leftovers. I dont think I get anything thats over $20.
Don‚Äôt buy naan from the restaurant, just go to the closest Indian store and get frozen (or fresh; or plain parantha - my personal favorite) naan - usually sold in packs of 4. Deep or Vadilal, both brands have decent naan. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing these days, as I cannot justify paying $6-7 for one naan, when I can get 4 for the same price or less in these stores. So while you‚Äôll pay the same, you can enjoy it more than once.

Edit: Pro tip- don‚Äôt follow the heating instructions on the pack, heat your over to 400F and put the naan in for like 7-8 minutes.
Spices keep getting more and more expensive. I can tell you for sure that Indian food prices have gone up everywhere not just nj. Try to find a place that at least gives good portions. I pay $25 up front but I typically get at least 2 meals worth of food so it‚Äôs really like $12 per meal.
I am Indian and have totally stopped going to these mediocre Indian restaurants. Cook everything at home, much healthier and cheaper. YouTube is your friend, DM to ask any questions as they come, happy to help.
This sadly is happening for most restaurants. I refuse to pay $10+ for mozzarella sticks or the soup of the day. At least most still have free soda refills
Learning to cook all the things I enjoy was the best thing I ever did. Stockpiling all the spices and staples is a bit of an investment up front but then it‚Äôs pretty smooth sailing after that
Cinnamon in Morris Plains has a reasonably priced all-you-can eat lunch buffet. Also a dinner buffet on Sundays. 
Personally I don‚Äôt like Indian food but everyone raves about this place. 

https://www.cinnamonindianrestaurant.net/
From my perspective as an Indian, they're definitely overcharging. The service is also consistently subpar. It feels like they're taking advantage of the limited availability of authentic Indian food, knowing many of us have specific taste preferences that are hard to replicate.
Indian food in the states has always positioned itself as a luxury/premium ethnic cuisine alongside sushi, korean bbq, french cuisine, etc. We do not have an indian takeout culture like they do in the UK where its comparable to chinese takeout and sold by the pint/quart, etc. These prices are basically pretty typical for the past decade or do, maybe slightly on the higher side owing to inflation, but even pre-covid i was paying in the neighborhood of $17-21 for the typical order of whatever curry + basmati rice
this is the one thing i miss about living in Jackson Heights, but i like my jersey driveway more than being in stumbling distance to Jackson Diner
I just want a place that serves thali bc I am one person and don‚Äôt need a family size of everything that costs $75. I want a lil rice, a lil veg and a lil meat. Why is it always $20 for one dish, $25 for another, etc etc????
It‚Äôs not just NJ. I travel quite a bit for work and it‚Äôs across the country. I have no idea why indian food is priced at a premium so often.
Yea that‚Äôs why I just started making my own stuff.

Butter chicken is hella easy to make.$20-$25 for an order is outrageous.

Just for reference I‚Äôm 35,was born in India but lived here for 25 years.

If I can do it anyone can.
Does anyone know a good Indian buffet with veg options like Malai Kofta? Most buffets cater to American / meat eaters / popular chicken dishes!
Agreed. Indian food does seem to be 10-20% more expensive than other similar foods. I really love Indian food, but it‚Äôs hard to justify getting anything other than a lunch buffet.
I live near Edison the amount of BMW's, Benzs and Teslas in the parking lots of some of these restaurants probably empower the owners of the restaurants to charge what they charge because most of the clientele can afford it.
I went to order some butter chicken on uber eats one night when I was kinda stoned. $20 

so I went ""alright, it's literally 2 minutes down the road and I can drive. I'll just go to the place and order. Probably jack up their prices for the food apps"" 

Nope. $20 in person too. Decided ""fuck it, im here anyway, and i'll save on delivery/fees"" 

Wasn't worth it. Wouldn't have been worth it via the app either, tbf
Every restaurant is like that now. Have you seen how much McDonald‚Äôs is?
Go to Jashan by Dhaba for lunch buffet which is $20-$23 only on Fri/sat/sun with dosa station and unique items that are not typically found in other places, with a big  array of vegetarian dishes as well. I order Bade Miyan Kebab platter from Dhaba Express in Parsippany and buy Naan from Costco. That meat with different style kebabs lasts me for 5-6 meals as I make a salad on the side. Order a family pack biryani from House of Biryani and Kebabs. It is HUGE!!! But a lot of rice. Cinnamon in Morristown was okay, nothing really impressive. Dakshin Express  on Oak Tree road has good biryanis and good quality curries and also sells South Indian snacks. Other restaurants in Edison on oak tree road have lunch buffets that are very economical. Other cheaper options are of course Trader Joe‚Äôs, butter chicken from Costco is great and I add some more spices and herbs to it.  Masala store on route22 is a store owned by Deep company which also stocks Trader Joe‚Äôs and is usually a dollar cheaper. Stock up on frozen lamb vindaloo, chicken biryani, paneer etc for 5-7 dollars and the dishes are actually quite good. Heat up in a pan and add extra veggies and spices. Indian spices in grocery stores in Edison and Parsippany are cheaper. Find chicken masala, coriander powder and cumin powder. That‚Äôs all you need and you can use them in veg and non-veg dishes as well. Indian food does take time to make but these restaurants are not making everything fresh so I don‚Äôt support the price hike while it‚Äôs true they don‚Äôt pay their workers a fair wage.
It really depends on where you go for the Indian food. 

Just like lot of regular Italian and Mexican high upscale restaurants, there has been a lot of Indian upscale restaurant being built to cater to different kind of customer. Profit margins are very high in this places, despite serving less customer. 

If you go to places that have been in business for a very long time, you‚Äôll still be able to get unlimited buffet for $17 per person during lunchtime , and if you go to some restaurants, you‚Äôll be able to get regular dishes between $15-$16 as well. 

If you‚Äôre in Central Jersey, here are some recommendation. 

Rasoi III (South Brunswick)
Honest (East Windsor - Vegetarian only)
Mogul (Franklin Park and Edison)
Aarzu (Freehold - on expensive side)
Lot of the curries come out great in an instantpot. Google myheartbeets for some great recipes
i bough a indian cookbook and started to make it myself at home.
hard agree - used to order from a place in upper montlcair all the time and for the wife and I it was constanlty like 90 dollars. Id had enough and not been back in a looooong time - love indian dishes but I can live without - always looking for a cheaper reccomendation thou.
Butter chicken for $20+ is a complete scam but that seems to be minimum price now everywhere
Especially Indian restaurants outside of areas with a lot of indians. The few in freehold are charging nearly double what you would get charged in edison/woodbridge. And that‚Äôs for a lower quality of food too.
It‚Äôs absolutely insane. Our place charges $35 for Chicken Tikka Masala and two naans. It‚Äôs a takeout and delivery place only and they charge you a $1.50 ‚Äòconvenience‚Äô fee for picking up in store‚Ä¶um that is the only other option aside from delivery.

I only order once or twice a year.
The new place in Morristown (Chakra), on top of  expensive prices for dishes, charges a 20% ""Service Fee"" ON TOP of any tip, whether dine-in, delivery, or even take out (wtf). We did that once, couldn't believe it.
Why are you buying naan from a restaurant? Thats like ordering *bread* intentionally from the italian place you order pizza from, because the free bread isnt good enough?

20$ for an entree of butter chicken is just normal resturant pricing now.

I dare you to show me a restaurant that serves a bugger dinner for *only* 15$ that isn't mcdonalds
As with anything good that becomes popular, the price goes up.
You're spot on. Indian restaurants often price themselves modestly‚Äîprobably because of customer expectations or local competition‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt reflect the real cost of running the kitchen. The prep is intense, the ingredient list is long, and the spices (especially good-quality ones) aren‚Äôt cheap at all. Add to that the rising costs of fresh produce, rent, and labor‚Äîit's not surprising that many of them struggle to thrive, even if the food is excellent.

North Jersey especially has a ton of Indian spots, but most seem to operate on razor-thin margins. Ever notice how many open and then quietly disappear a year or two later?

And yeah, comparing it to Italian is fair‚Äî$24 for penne with vodka sauce and grilled chicken isn‚Äôt unusual, but if a biryani cracks $20, people start whining. Why do you think Indian spots haven't broken into the ""premium casual"" or elevated dining space more successfully around here?
I thought this was Reddit, not a nursing home.  When I first started going to Pooja in Somerset, it was $8 for the buffet.  Yeah, and that was in 1997.  Costs go up.  Wages go up.  Blame the billionaires that are hoarding all their wealth at the top and not paying you more.  Google wealth gap 1997 and wealth gap 2023.
Is it unique to Indian food?

I just got an omelet and coffee at a diner and it was $30, not worth it. 

The $1.50 surcharge for eggs put me over the top and now I really need to stop going there.
Yeah I get Indian like once a year because of how expensive it is
I think it's still pretty fairly priced up here in India Square in JC...
Indian food contains a lot of expensive spices.
I usually get two out of:

1. Paneer makhani 
2. Chicken Tika masala 
3. Palak paneer
4. Lamb saag

Plus a naan for $36 with a cash discount. Used to be $32, but still doesn‚Äôt seem too bad to me.
I mean if it is busy and good, they will charge what diners will support.
May I suggest Amma's kitchen for South Indian food.  There are multiple spots throughout NJ. What they lack in decor and ambiance they more than make up for with taste, portion, and price.
lol fish n chips is like $20 and it's supposed to be a working class food.
There were lots of cheaper spots in Edison when I lived in the area 10 years ago. I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôs still plenty there.
They probably don't get even close to the number of orders a Chinese place gets, so have to make up the difference some how.
Rivaaz Gastro Bar and Indian restaurant on 23 in Pequannock is our go to spot and it‚Äôs pretty reasonable.
I live in Jersey city. I kinda agree with this. Some restaurants here are over priced now after covid. I cook at home which is healthier and cheaper. But yes, there are days when im lazy and on weekends. You want to rest and order takeout. I wonder how these prices go up with Tariffs in future!
Same over here. My wife and I are basic when it comes to Indian dishes. I‚Äôm usually tikka masala and she‚Äôs saag paneer. We started buying the sauce at wegmans and making it ourselves. It‚Äôs not glamorous but it‚Äôs pretty gall darn good especially when I save 50 bucks in the process. Takes the same amount of time to cook it as it does for someone to drive it over from the slow local restaurant.
Cook at home
For South Indian restaurants, a2b in South Plainfield and saravanabhavan in oak tree road is good
Everything is expensive now. I regularly spend $40 just on me to eat take out
BBQ & Karahi House in Matawan is reasonably priced.
A paneer roll in Egg Mania at Iselin used to be $7 a couple years ago, now it‚Äôs $12.  It‚Äôs just some paneer & onion rolled in a roti, ingredients probably cost $2. They shouldn‚Äôt be charging that much. Definitely making a killing.
You should give Pakistani restaurants a try :) similar food, and we also eat beef

https://goodfoodbyuzma.com/menu
It's seriously so expensive now! And most of the time the curries don't even come with rice or naan anymore.
Is there a reason you expect sushi and French food to be worth more than Indian food?

A lot of how we think cuisine should be priced comes down to cultural bias. Europe is ‚Äúfancy.‚Äù So is Japan. But Thailand isn‚Äôt, and (presumably for you) neither is India.

tl/dr sounds like Indian food is valued more highly by the market than what you think it should be.
I'm (not) paying 15 bucks for Chicken 65 at my local
Go to Costco and get a pre made Indian dish (the one I just bought has two pouches of butter chicken) and naan or the flaky bread which is a new addition, tastes great
I been getting like 3-4 chunks of meat in my tikka masala soup no matter where I go

Edit: if anybody has recs for somerset I will gladly take them. Been looking for a good tiffin service too
Subway chicken rubber sandwich and a coke cost me $17 today, before the tip :)
I used to live near Pasadena, CA years ago. There was an all you can eat Indian joint on Colorado Blvd that cost like 10 bucks. Those were the days
There's an Indian food bazaar on RT 46 which is great for spices, Naan and also has samosas.
This has always been the case IMO
Was just at The Spice Room in Elmwood park for dinner, will definitely be going back - $16 for a really tasty butter chicken. Two entrees, two naan, and an app came out right around $50 before tip
Yes!  This is so true.

Unfortunately, it seems that everything is getting crazy expensive these days when you order takeout.
The Chozas in Milstone is pretty good. There are a lot of Indians who frequent the place as well. It's more sit down and wait since they make every order fresh. You can even see them making the Naan in the traditional looking ovens where they throw the dough on the sides.

The food is $20-30 (cheaper for vegan) but it comes with rice, a chip basket, and I've never left without lunch for the next day.
2 orders chicken tikka, 1 order chicken fried rice, 1 order naan, 1 12oz soda is usually like $80 off Door Dash, $60 if you pick it up. It's crazzzzzzzzy.
There is nothing worse than modern Indian food. I used to eat at Bombay Spice II in Edison and now the whole place has been remodeled with a new modern menu. I just want a legit chicken murgh tikka.
Go to Masala Art in Branchburg.
I drove by a nice little Dosa shop earlier this month, so I stopped on a whim and nonchalantly ordered the special. It was $14 (before tax) for a 100% vegetarian dosa meal. Shiva on a pogo stick.
I can‚Äôt get a chicken Tikka masala take out for under $18 now and the portions are a LOT smaller. No way I‚Äôm
Getting 2 meals from it. Even buying frozen meals at ShopRite are $8-$9. The ones at Lidl cost $5 but they taste like shit. Trader Joe‚Äôs is still the spot to get frozen garlic naans though for cheap. Only value for money these days are the buffets.
Crazy I thought it was just the joints in my town that had sky high pricing. I would love to try any of them but I'm not paying 28+ dollars for some Chicken tikka masala.
any good places in Essex ?
You can buy spice packs to make anything, the brand Shan is great, I use their biryanis mix. Not paying $18 for a plate of rice at a restaurant.
Yeah indian food was always the punk rock cheapest
Its everywhere, im in south jersey, i love the nizams but they are so expensive now, 7$ just for a side dish of spinach! I prefer cooking at home for that reason. Spices were always expensive but everything is expensive now, anything that isnt fast food is too expensive nowadays imo.
Go to Namaste India in Mahwah.

It's v good value.

Like my Indian mother in law opts to have it rather than cook her own now. It's that $:labor cheap. And so goooooodddd
It's crazy, $5 for a piece of naan, then a basic curry is $18 and if you want rice with it that's an extra $6 lol. I stopped eating Indian because of this. Even a local convenience store was recently bought out by Indians and made a few changes. They added Indian food to the menu which used to just be a few sandwiches. $16 for gas station Indian food lol
I ate Indian food for the first time and I was shitting for 2 days...good times
Robbery 4 pieces of chicken tikka, 20+, guy tells me oh it is exotic spices, please stop
I would never shell out $25-$32 for a butter chicken and naan lol. That's absolutely a rip-off unless it's a plate/container size for two people to share. 

Now lamb or goat dishes are definitely more worthy of that price range (and usually end up in it) but what you mentioned is like paying veal dish prices for a chicken parm. 

Screw that because there's plenty of competition amongst Desi eateries here in NJ. Finding a sensible place (think the take-out only types for instance like Delhi Garden on route 27) is doable. Just make sure to do your research beforehand.

Side note: For $25-32 you should be receiving not just butter chicken and naan but also 2-4 samosas to go with them.
It‚Äôs wild. Even NYC isn‚Äôt this expensive in some spots
I agree that $25-32 is expensive, but Indian food isn‚Äôt cheap overall. It‚Äôs fair that it‚Äôs more expensive than burger or pasta. 
I haven‚Äôt eaten at an Indian curry place for a while, so don‚Äôt know about the prices though.
Got some for delivery last night, 2 separate dishes‚Ä¶ neither one came with rice. Since when did they stop putting rice on the side with curry dinners?
Tariffs. Just wait, the other places will go up too.
$20.50 for naan ($3.50) and butter chicken ($17) at Karma Kafe in Hoboken.
My go-to Indian restaurant is Paheli Modern Indian Cuisine on Berdan Ave in Wayne. Most of their entrees range from $20 to $30. They have a sister restaurant, Praana Indian Cuisine, right down the street on Hamburg Tpke that offers strictly vegetarian dishes and is also less expensive.
I'm loving Taj in Hazlet. The portion sizes are large so it makes multiple meals for me, usually about 3 meals. The shahi paneer ($15.99 and it comes with a decent amount of rice with fennel seeds) is probably my favorite thing on the planet at the moment, their quality is great. It's a fairly new spot.
Red pepper in scotch plains for lunch on 22 east. Best place IMO, lunch special all you can eat for like 20$
It‚Äôs not just Indian restaurants. The cost of eating out pretty much anywhere has skyrocketed.

I tried a new place in Warren this week.  $34 for chicken tikka masala, naan bread and a $5 appetizer‚Ä¶takeout.  Expensive takeout for one person
2 for 99
I ordered butter chicken, two orders of naan, and samosas the other day and it was $48. I didn‚Äôt even realize it was that much until I walked in to pickup and pay. Astronomical.
Don't pay it. It's the only way these restaurants learn
Yes.
Most decent take-out is $20+ now.  McDonald‚Äôs is $12-15 so I‚Äôd expect good food to be $20.  I got a chicken teriyaki box and order of shumai from a sushi spot by me the other day and it was $29.  That‚Äôs the world we live in now, time to do some more home cooking!
I‚Äôve drastically reduced eating out in general since COVID. It‚Äôs been expensive all around except for like Chipotle and Pizza. 

Also not to hate but the quality of restaurants in NJ aren‚Äôt as great as NYC imo but the prices are almost the same. So if I do go out I‚Äôll go into the city. 

Much healthier eating at home though
Everything (including Indian restaurants) is soooo expensive.
Buy a dish and buy Naan at Wegmans.

Still depends on the place some are more reasonable than others but I've seen a few go the luxury or gourmet route and try to gussy up dishes with orchids etc. The meal is the same
Just reacting to title in general, but everything seems to be like that now. I really don't eat Indian food, so not sure. I ordered an 18'"" pizza pie half pepperon last night I. I ordered some other stuff, but pie alone was 19 bucks. It sure looks like it shrunk, compared to  the last time I ordered one. So crazy!
Its a NJ thing; I'm indian and we were in NC and a 4 person buffet was ~$60 for all of us. Some ordered lassi etc. 
That same meal would be ~$100 just for the food in NJ. 
We have one of the largest Indian diaspora this side of the Mississippi, and most Indians are a bit ""financially gifted"" or wealthy, it seems the prices are catered toward them.
Bamboo Leaf in Asbury is VERY good. Try the duck!
How about $25 take out pizza, and they get upset of you don‚Äôt tip.
The decline in Indian food quality stems from several factors.  Firstly, cost-cutting measures often prioritize inexpensive, bulk ingredients from restaurant supply depots, frequently utilizing pre-made, frozen meats requiring minimal preparation. Secondly, employing less skilled chefs to minimize labor costs compromises culinary expertise and results in reheated, standardized dishes.  Finally, understaffing to maximize profits negatively impacts service quality, potentially leading to delays and suboptimal food presentation.
I‚Äôm okay with paying more for high quality meats and ingredients. But that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre spending that extra profit on
Lunch buffets are where it‚Äôs at. They are more expensive than they used to be but I think you still get the best value from the Indian restaurants.
Did a bulk order with friends a few weeks ago and nothing came with rice. There was a section for sides which had rice listed but nobody in their right mind would expect a butter chicken entree to not include rice. It still cost like 15 bucks
I wonder if it might be your area. I was curious, so I picked relatively similar Indian and Italian places (Clove and Bella Mia in Phillipsburg) to check their menus, and a chicken tandoori and a vodka penne were both $18. Clove has stellar vibes and service too - and, if you get takeout, they load you up with samples and extras. So if you're out this way, that's one to try.
the place im abt to mention is pakistani food, but gulberg bistro near brunswick does buy one get one deals on doordash. great bang for your buck.
This is an interesting thread ‚Ä¶ do folks know the rental cost of a place these days ? Additionally it‚Äôs not just the food. It‚Äôs what it takes to put it together ‚Ä¶ here is a partial list of everything you have to organize before you cook that butter chiken and serve it in a nice environment; (I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing many more)

1. Pay rent - in some towns as high as $10-15k a month in NJ
2. Pay utilities 
3. Pay insurance and license costs 
4. Pay permit costs 
5. Pay for stoves and tandoors 
6. Pay for a chef
7.  Pay for prep chef, tandoor chef and dishwashers 
8. Buy tables chairs and plates and glasses and knives and forks and spoons and pots and plain and serving dishes 
9. Pay wait staff 
10. Pay for the food ingredients - some which have tripled in price since the pandemic like lamb and rice and onions 
11. Pay for marketing 
12 pay for the garbage removal and the cleaners and the disinfectant and all of the services mandated by the health department 
13. Pay taxes 

Oh and then cook the food and serve it in a nice clean place with lights and tables and smiling friendly wait staff
Its a business. If by not paying decent wages ( idk
Whatever you mean by that) and not spending ungodly amounts ( labor is expensive) on the upkeep of the establishment, they can still get folks to spend $24 on whatever mediocre curry and rice‚Äî it means all that extra money is going straight to theor bottom line.

As a business, its their goal to maximise the profits.
Butter chicken isn't even an expensive dish to make. It's not even difficult either. Chef Harpal Singh Sokhi has good recipes. Better off making Indian food at home.
lol I‚Äôve known this for years
5 dollars for a fucking naan, ü§£ no thanks
Hudson county is horrendous for Indian food. Expensive and bad.
Gotta go to Edison.
Arzu in Freehold is pretty great! We don‚Äôt go often because it is pricey but it‚Äôs always a fantastic experience.
No they absolutely are. But a few places give you unlimited rice.
There was a spot in Bayonne called Masala Express hands down the best chicken tikka masala and the best curry I‚Äôve ever had, they closed down because they weren‚Äôt getting much business (I guess there wasn‚Äôt a demand for Indian food in that area?) but their low prices didn‚Äôt help either I guess. For chicken tikka masala and garlic naan it came out to like 5 bucks (and the masala came with rice)
Very blanket statement lol. Depends on the place, some are 'upscale' and regardless of how good the food is, your paying upscale prices. Plenty of good smaller places. Just pick and choose. 

Plus there are many 'types' of indian food lol. Street food, vs punjab, vs south indian vs etc etc etc. Shop around or something lol.
Make it yourself bro. It‚Äôs not hard and it‚Äôs delicious
It‚Äôs gonna be sad when all the overpriced places close down
You gatta go to green valley giro in Manchester/toms River. Mom and pop shop and the food is cheap and the best around(my boyfriend is friend India and says it‚Äôs better than fancy places)
I always felt Indian restaurants were overpriced. That‚Äôs why I always go to their buffets. Much better deal.
Yup, food prices reflect rising rent and labor
Union. Has deep Indian kitchen, its fast casual Indian with really great prices and a grocery store across the street as well with amazing products at really affordable prices. A 16 pack of massive garlic naan for 8 bucks. Anyway. It's good every time. Been going there since they opened¬†
Yeah. A lot of times people from out of state come and dine at an indian or pakistani or bengali restaurant because they are more rare in charleston, West Virginia or Akron, Ohio or Concord, New Hampshire. New Jersey has somewhat had a monopoly on Indian cuisine. I could be wrong. Does anybody have a more interesting response?
Pakistani isn‚Äôt any cheaper and Kashmiri is non existent. So i just to go my mom‚Äôs when i need a hit of good food. Normally i bring a large bag of rice for her because that stuff is kinda expensive now.
I just cook at home anymore. You can usually cook anything a restaurant makes at home pretty easy.
For real. There's one by my house I was dying to try and I did and it was not even good. If it was better it would be fair but the menu was bland and boring. Not going back. Supposedly a new one is coming but we'll see.
Agree. I need a north jersey version of curry in a hurry.
Honestly real reason?

Indians are some of, if not most, highly earning individuals in the US. And most Indians are gonna be either in Cali or NJ/NY Area. We're good business people, we're gonna charge more if our target demo will pay more. (I don't own an Indian restaurant, but this is just the mindset). We are very cheap when it comes to most things, but food is almost never on that list.
Because it's new and exotic and unfamiliar with our area. It's not that hard or expensive to make curry at home, especially if you just grab a jar of simmer sauce and fresh veg. I can get 2-3 meals out of $10 worth of ingredients.
Not for nothing but businesses that deliberately have wildly inflated prices tend to be a front/money laundering operation.
There are a lot of high earning Indians in the NJ tech industry driving up the prices for us commoners
Our beloved governor increased minimum wage from 9 to 15 in 6 years. Supply chain and costs of said supplies are either not available or have doubled in price. Rents have gone through the roof. Assuming you've never owned a business, what would you do if your costs doubled and you have a family to feed? These small business owners aren't going to Hawaii or Florida every other week and living it up.

I own a small business and I know so many people who own small businesses that are just giving up.

Cue the ""if you can't pay a living wage you can't run a business"" morons typing from their basement. Good luck when all you have is Walmart and Amazon subsidizing their business with food stamps that you pay for instead of a local family run business that cares about their employees.
And an extra side of rice is $8 rofl
Jesus. That‚Äôs robbery. It probably cost a total of 5 dollars to make a batch at most.
It‚Äôs the spices that you are posting for really
That is insane!
Trader joes has better Indian food than the last place I went. Sad.
I'd say that's exactly what it costs since you paid for it lol.
Indian food is 10x more labor intensive than French or Italian food. They've been undercharging for years. If you're okay buying pasta at $30 a plate for a handful of gnocchi- where the sauce consists of butter, garlic, lemon, tomato, cheese and paying $8-12 for a side of garlic bread or $25 for a single topping pizza that is mediocre at best- you can be okay with $24 for chana masala where each spice involved is most costly than garlic, lemon, and tomato combined. Rice prices are being driven up by drought.


If you want cheap Indian food, make it yourself at home.
 Bay leaf in south orange
Karma Kafe in Hoboken has a great lunch buffet
Any place near Rutgers-Main campus?
Kashan Clifton
If you know any places in/near Monmouth county, I‚Äôd love the inside scoop!
I refuse to eat Indian food unless it's buffet. The a la carte pricing scheme is totally out of whack. I like my indian food with stuff, like naan, some raita, whatever stuff like that. If you order a chicken dish for example a la carte, for 20 bucks you get rice and chicken, that's it. That fucking sucks. if you want some naan and raita, mango chutney or some flippin pickle, that's all 4$ extra a pop. 4 bucks for a scoop of raita? 3 bucks for some pickle? Come the fuck on man.
Sapthagiri in JC on Wednesday nights - dosa and chaat night. It's all veg, but it's damn good and is $18 or $19 a person.

I go like once a month and binge eat dosas.
üíØ worth it
Tandoori Flames, Parsipanny baby
Nizams in Egg Harbor Twp.
What are you recommendations for dinner buffet? I have a ton of places near me that do lunch buffet, but I can't find a good dinner buffet.
Bollywood Tadka is a solid spot. The lunch buffet is like $12 per person for AYCE and they do it every day.
Yess love Bollywood Tadka. Good food, good prices, friendly staff. The buffet is so worth it. Also if you order on Uber eats they almost always have buy one, get one free deals. The other week I got two full orders of chicken tika masala and two mango lassi for about $20 plus tip.
I'll have to check them out now (on 18 daily)
I agree if you're ordering take out for home or w/e but if I'm going out I'm not brining my own naan lol

Bombay Blue in Edison is charging like $5 for a Garlic Naan and you only get one. Back in the day you'd get 2 for $3 in most places. I know inflation and all but when its like $60 for like paneer/chicken meal + 2 little cups of rice + garlic naan.. idk. They basically priced me out of it. 

On top of that if you get delivery they give you like 4 pieces of paneer/chicken/goat (always all bone)/w.e and just a ton of masala
The garlic naan from Trader Joe‚Äôs is my go-to for store naan
Frozen Indian food is pretty good.
Air fryer works great for it too.
weak, naan has to be fresh...
Another pro tip, wet the frozen naan quickly before putting it in the oven. You‚Äôll get the most soft moist naan ever.
Plus you can enjoya variety of the different naans (garlic, bullet/chili, etc) without the upcharge
Same here, the biryani I order is about $18 and gives me about 3 meals.

Isn't saffron one of the most expensive spices?
This is the trick, I expect to get two meals for my wife and I for $30 worth of food.  Indian food is very filling.
Buy spices from your supermarket's international or ""ethnic"" aisle because it's cheaper there as opposed to the actual spice aisle.
More than spices the price of rent has gone up. Landlords are getting more than ever before and restaurant margins are slimmer than they've ever been.
Slightly will agree, I will only buy food I cannot cook; curry goat or more labor intensive sides.


Last time I ordered, it was a oil slick with 4-5 chunks of meat in a pint container. I'm kinda astonished at some commentary, its always butter chicken!


¬†No clue where to source goat, one of the things you need a community I guess.
It's funny, but I grew up with home cooked Italian food my whole life, and I'm at a point where I'm just not really impressed by any of the dime-a-dozen Italian restaurants you find in the state, and would always prefer to cook it myself. 

Indian food on the other hand, I just don't have it down yet.  I try, but when I'm craving, I hit up my local joint and it's fantastic.
Totally agree! I love to cook but I was always intimated by cooking Indian food. But honestly most of the complexity was just in sourcing the spices. You learn a lot of new techniques but nothing is too difficult. 

After finding the spices (most on Amazon since I don‚Äôt have Indian grocers near me), I honestly made the best saag gosht/ lamb palak I‚Äôve ever had. I made a 6quart pot for about $50 total which I got 10 meals out of. I used YouTube to learn. 

. [this was the recipe](https://youtu.be/eVDgIIuSb7I?si=O-4IQgjDzTk9Wy1X)
For real. It's not that hard to make. My mom. And grandma taught me.
And it's really not the most challenging cuisine. I've even baked fresh naan and it's not too bad.
I refuse to cook Indian at home because I don‚Äôt have an exhaust that vents outside. Home-cooked khaana may be great but not worth destroying your home (and clothes).
My mom is friends w the owner or something, been there a couple times, its pretty legit
This place is great! They have rotating goat and lamb weekdays for a fair price which you almost never see. Actually this and the Parsippany area has the best Indian buffet scene in NJ, much better than Edison. There are tons of good places along rt 46 in Parsippany. Honestly haven't been to a bad one, and even the ones that are slightly lacking are priced accordingly, they are all worth checking out.

The main problem with Cinnamon is the premade naan. Fresh naan makes a mountain of difference. Some of the Rt 46 shops do fresh naan which is huge.
Great price for an all you can eat!
In NYC there are plenty of cheap Indian options, but all I have around me here in NJ is pretty pricey.
I was just about to say this. I feel like most Indian restaurants are on par with Italian restaurants- expensive but big portions.
Doubles.


No shirt survived when I got one. Where I live there is no Trinidad/Tobago places, ironically my neighborhood has a lot of muslim.¬†
Jackson Diner was awesome. I miss the food in Queens.
If you‚Äôre near East Windsor, go to Khasiyat. My wife grew up in India and loves eating there.
Make Indian Cheap Again!
What recipe do you follow?
Chand Palace, all veg, fresh and excellent, great buffet, Piscataway
Edison is kind of crazy, you would think they would have the best indian food for the best prices, but shit is kind of overpriced there. You can get much better Indian food prices just about anywhere else. 25-30 bucks for weekend buffet at a lot of places.
Interesting list. How much is Bade Miyan Kebab Platter? Persis Biryani in Edison is great. My go-to for Punjabi food is Delhi Garden. Delhi Garden has great food and good portions.¬†
Just wanted to add that Honest has a good location in Raritan Borough too near 206 and there's also a Moghul (express version) on Stelton Road in Piscataway.
Brick lane curry house? To be fair that place was one of the best in the state and they had the prices to match
Learn to make it then. I'm Indian and it's not even what we make at home anyway.
How is that Indian restaurant next to Cheesecake Factory at the mall if you've been there/heard anything? Thanks ahead of time.
Now that's what I call a crazy rip-off. I understand goat or lamb being up there but definitely not chicken.
This restaurant is a ripoff. Please don't go there anymore. Sewrch for different ones. I'm Indian and I hate when our prices leave people's wallets hurting
>North Jersey especially has a ton of Indian spots, but most seem to operate on razor-thin margins. Ever notice how many open and then quietly disappear a year or two later?

That's probably more to do with simple market saturation vs. margins. Margins on any restaurant are generally pretty thin. I used to run a burger joint and didn't want to rob people on pricing. It's a hard business when you give a shit about people's wallets. Otherwise, not so much.
You are right. It's not unique.  
  
Indian food has multiple genres. Street food is supposed to be cheap. And Lunch food is supposed to be comparable to pizza prices. But literally everything is going to a $25 range.  
  
Imagine paying $25 for 2 slices and a coke.
Any recommendations?
Lol naah not really. This isn't the 1300s that spices are expensive.
I'm an Indian. I cook this stuff daily.
Which one? There's like 30.
One in Newark, Edison and who knows where else
I heard very good things about Ammas and was excited to check it out. I went to one in south jersey and it was delicious but the portions were small and price was expensive. It was 12 dollars for 2 samosas and then 25 for a main dish. I‚Äôm usually someone who can get at least two meals out of my dinner and I comfortably finished it. I was so sad, I wanted it to be worth it.
If you haven't tried their paneer bhurji and malai kofta, do so.
Never going there
you guys got anything similar to malai kofta?
Nice but it‚Äôs too far away. Any Pakistani restaurants for folks in the North? I know there are a lot of Bangladesh restaurants pretending to be Indian restaurants. Their price is fairly reasonable.
oh yes
Hmm, at least as between Indian food and sushi, the quality required to produce decent sushi that doesn't food-poison you is more expensive than the ingredients I consistently observe used at my local Indian restaurant.  A melt-in-your-mouth piece of raw ahi is expensive vs the hacked chicken parts and lamb neck bones I've fished out of some Indian food.  I'm fine paying for quality ingredients.
Damn. Spice Wok in East Windsor be charging 20+ for chicken 65 and the portion size keeps shrinking.
I would also say DON'T buy the chicken shwarma. No clue what its supposed to taste like but it was just salt in my opinion.
I stick to Delhi Garden on 27 in Edison. Just go through Highland Park to get there. It's take-out only btw.
10-14 was the lunch price for many places pre-pandemic, now it's closer to 20 and 25-30 in some cases..
ehhh, that place aiight...
A chip basket? Like what kind of chips? Hmm...
Murgh = chicken in hindi. So you want chicken chicken tikka?

And I agree, as an Indian born and raised in India, I hate the ""modern twist"" on Indian food. It's just regular indian food with slightly different spices.... Making it just an another curry. And I personally don't go to these restaurants and just cook at home. The cooking part is surprisingly easy but getting all the ingredients is a bitch.
Used to pick up there alot for DoorDash back when I did that in Somerset County. Way more than any of their nearby competitors. That's how I know it's good haha.
Late 2024 they did change how some of the LIDL ones are made but what you expect for five in this economy?


Never found ready made- hot togo east Indian at Shoprite BUT Hazlet sometimes has jerk chicken.
That price is a steal
Thanks will try
Sure will try
Thank you will try
That‚Äôs next-level takeout pricing for just one person
Oh man, that‚Äôs brutal! $48 for butter chicken, a couple of naans, and samosas? That‚Äôs the kind of sticker shock that hits you out of nowhere. You‚Äôre just vibing, thinking you‚Äôre in for a nice meal, and then bam pickup time turns into a wallet ambush.
And what people will pay.
Hey I'd try having higher margins too if many of my target market drove BMW's/Mercedes/Tesla's (poor Lexus gets left out often hehe)
Look, I‚Äôm no damn ‚Äòbasement typer‚Äô I‚Äôm just pissed off shelling out $48 for butter chicken and naan when NJ restaurants are jacking prices way past what inflation or your wage hikes can excuse! I get it, costs are up minimum wage, rent, supplies it‚Äôs a bitch. But as a small biz owner yourself, don‚Äôt bullshit me: there‚Äôs a difference between covering your ass and gouging us like we‚Äôre all rolling in cash. I‚Äôm not here preaching ‚Äòliving wage‚Äô crap. I‚Äôm saying quit screwing us every time we want a damn meal! Sort it out!
$15 an hour isn‚Äôt even a living wage.  All of the money is at the top, go check out a graph of cost of living increases vs wage increases since Reagan‚Äôs trickle down economics.  But wait a few more years, surely, surely, those billionaire tax cuts will come down to the poor and middle class soooooon!
THIS! This has been the highway robbery crime, in my opinion. The price of side of rice and or naan.
When you start to cook yourself and see how much materials cost... things like a side of rice prices make no sense
Ganesha.  That‚Äôs robbery
It's one banana, Michael. What could it cost? Ten dollars?
Probably like $3 or so.
So much of it is food dye in some dishes. We recently ordered a side of saffron rice and it was unnaturally orange.
Is it? A box of Shan butter chicken spice is $2. It can‚Äôt be that much.
This person FREE MARKETS
> **10x more** labor intensive than French or Italian food

>handful of gnocchi

Gnocchi just appears on plants or something? Gnocchi is not labor intensive to make?
Educate us. What's so much more laborious about indian cuisine?
Nah, this is BS, because the difference between this and a traditional restaurant is that you can cook a lot at once. They par cook a lot of chickpeas, par cook a lot of gravy. Then everything is assembled to order.

You can easily make 5 orders of a specific dish at once, because everything is already cooked.
Thought they did away with their buffet?!¬†
I will check it out
I went there once and was very unimpressed. It was at most mediocre- definitely not worth going back to. I live in the area and would rather drive to JC for India Square.

I will add we were eating the fresh, ala carte stuff, not the buffet, so even more reason not to go back. I can't imagine the buffet is better.
Chand Palace in Piscataway has the best buffet quality in my opinion. Just know that it's a vegetarian one.
Nirvani has good kathi roll but the owner is very shitty person
Do you drive?
There‚Äôs one in Piscataway in a strip mall but I think it‚Äôs a veggie spot
Chand palace
Delhi Garden near Edison station, takeout only
if youre a rutgers student, gulberg bistro does bogo on doordash
Or their takeout lunch special. A bit smaller than it used to be, but still a decent price for something I can squeeze two lunches out of.
I haven‚Äôt tried the buffet but Mauka in Eatontown is legit. Sooooooo good.
There's got to be one in Red Bank worth checking out probably (just be prepared to pay for parking hehe).
Neelam 1127 NJ 35.


I used to get their buffet lunch, then covid hit. They still exist, I just can't eat anymore in places. I can't recall the bunch but there was one called Royal Bombay...I don't think I liked their food, oil slick curry, BUT I also tried a bunch of places so my memory is muddled.
Sawan
On rt9
Royal Ganesha in Freehold has a lunch buffet.
Sawan is without a doubt best bang for the buck.

Mauka is good but priced much higher. And only fri to Sunday. 

Neelam does buffet only on Sundays or something now, I think. 

Whatever you do, don't go to the one at freehold Mall. 

There's tandoor e in Ocean, place is decent for fair price but I haven't been in years. 

There's another buffet in downtown freehold but I haven't been yet.
Agra in Red Bank. Bombay River in Red Bank. Mauka in Eatontown. Arzu in Freehold. All good. Agra is our personal fave
India Garden in Belmar! Excellent
Yeah the dinner buffet by me is $26 meanwhile chicken tikka is $22. Its a no brainer to do the buffet and they even have desserts
Cinnamon in morris plains has great dinner buffet
Oh no kidding? I always do their local website and every few orders I get a free entree!
>I'm not brining my own naan

""You've heard of BYOB. Now, get ready for... BYON!""
I dated a girl who's dad would sneak in a slice of cheese in his shirt pocket to put on the hamburger to not pay the extra dollar or so for the diner cheese.
Any place in edison or that area where prices are reasonable and food is good? Indians highly recommend Palace of India (Parlin). It‚Äôs good but expensive.
BB is so damn good. Doesn't excuse the prices, but yea.
Yeah goats definitely a tricky one. To be fair though the almost all-bone issue is also valid at Caribbean and Filipino restaurants (and don't get me started on Ox Tails haha)
This is why I refuse to eat Indian food unless it's buffet. The a la carte pricing scheme is totally out of whack. I like my indian food with stuff, like naan, some raita, whatever stuff like that. If you order a chicken dish for example a la carte, for 25 bucks you get rice and chicken, that's it. That fucking sucks. if you want some naan and raita, mango chutney or some flippin pickle, that's all 4$ extra a pop. 4 bucks for a scoop of raita? 3 bucks for some pickle? Come the fuck on man.
Insider info. If you like Trader Joe's garlic naan (or tandoori naan) then go to an Indian store and buy Deep brand naan. Same goes for chicken Tikka masala and most frozen entrees like Spinach paneer, chicken vindaloo etc

If you are still wondering then will make it easy for you. Deep makes almost all Indian food you find at trader Joe's.
What's crazy is even their frozen Indian meals are good! I know it's sacrilege, but kinda awesome in a pinch!
Yes but not everyone is using real saffron
Why does saffron sound like a compound from Dune ü§£
It's expensive but you use a very very small amount of it per dish.
You can buy goat in a nearby halal meat shop, just be careful though with making sure it is relatively fresh. I don't eat goat so can't offer any advice here but might want to ask around.
Mhm. I even learned how to make my own pho broth and my fiance actually likes it more than the restaurant stuff. It‚Äôs so worth it
Thanks, I'll try it next time!
True, but as someone who has frequented a couple of these places when I was living in Manhattan, (1) they are not advertised well (2) it's definitely no-frills and caters to the ""taxi driver"" Pakistani/ African muslim working class. We lack (2) out here in NJ with our lack of [extensive/ established] taxi services, so makes sense we don't have cheap options.
Ish, only reason i didnt use that as an example is because a lot of people imagind a red sauce spot/pizzeria when you say italian restaurant, and thats more like takeout, but yeah an upscale italian restaurant isnt dissimilar from typical indian restaurants, tho i dont think the portions are usually all that generous at an indian restaurant
hell yeah, used to go to a hole in the wall spot out by JFK airport to get doubles...jackson heights didn't have too many carribean restaurants but out towards Jamaica / Rockaway had some gems
> Where I live there is no Trinidad/Tobago places

Caribbean curry is a whole different game
Dera was on my corner...i used to love getting the cardamom tea in the winter

not much for late night food in jersey except wawa / quick check / fast food
Don‚Äôt really have one recipe I‚Äôll take from many online and from the masala boxes and honestly wing it.

 Most Indian food I cook starts with sauteeing onions ginger garlic in ghee/oil with cumin and mustard seeds. Once that‚Äôs fried up I‚Äôll add tomatoes and spices.I use turmeric,coriander powder,red chilli powder and garam masala. Now you can add water or stock and you have a curry.

Alter slightly with more tomatoes and cream and there you go.

Can also just get the spice mix and add that with the other stuff.

Once you have that base down you can pretty much cook anything you want and it‚Äôll taste good.

Hope this helps.
https://twosleevers.com/instant-pot-butter-chicken/

This is the best and easiest butter chicken I've ever made... has tons of dipping sauce, too.
I second this! Great place and kind staff too.
Yeah I'm not big on Indian food in general I usually just go to those places once in a while when my friends want to.  Judging by the parking lot you think you're going to like a Michelin star restaurant then you go in there It's a run of the mill buffet/ middle class restaurant
it was indeed! yes really nice, but just to expensive for me.
It was good but the prices were to match. Didn't go often. 

I thought they were closed for good. Meh either way to bth. 

(Nothing beats the absurdity of bareburger in Montclair off bloomfield ave, the fuck is this price the menu. Somehow people are keeping it in business. But I live in Montclair and barely eat out for a reason, $$)
No doubt. The point is that the fact is that rent is increasing and so is food. They don't exactly make a tin of bread. What those people do is save and invest,  and they react to the market.  At least for now,  restaurants are busy but it isn't a sure thing.
They all have pretty much the same menu, however the one I tried was in Edison.
12 dollars for two Samosas is insane! Apparently the one in South Jersey is not part of the Amma's Kitchen chain. The South Jersey one is Amma's South Indian Cuisine, which is a different chain.  The one in Edison is part of a chain that was founded on providing  delicious and affordable food.
I think you'd have better luck finding that at an Indian place. Some Pakistani places might carry it because of the crossover between Pakistani and North Indian cuisine (you can thank the British and Partition for that).
There should be plenty. I remember going to Edison as a kid for Pakistani and Afghani food. What area are you from?
A melt-in-your-mouth piece of butter chicken is also expensive. I‚Äôm not sure what your point is. 

At best, you‚Äôre just saying that there‚Äôs a quality floor for sushi because if it gets bad enough it won‚Äôt pass a health inspection. (Which is also not true ‚Äî there‚Äôs lots of shitty but edible sushi.)
That's crazy! I feel you though, that price gets you one of those little kid plate-sized containers and most of it is veg with a couple chunks of chicken.
Papad I think? But cut like tortilla chips.

Like seeded chips but super light and crispy. Comes with some kinda jelly dip and a slightly spicy green yogurty one. They're really good mixed together.
Wait til you see the portion sizes, it's fantastic
Good place. Bollywood Grill is known for Kati rolls.¬†
You can tell old money vs new money. Old money buys Lexus/Acura. New money buys everything else.
Cook for yourself you have no idea what the costs equate to. It's not a charity and it's not us increasing all the costs on the back end.
Socialist countries will gladly take you
Remember though that commercial restaurants have other overheads that us family cooks don't calculate at home. 

How much power or gas does our stove use to cook and serve our food? 
How much would it cost us if we were paying ourselves to make the meal, including prep time? 
Are we buying the cheapest ingredients, or are we buying better quality ingredients in bulk, needing extra dry and cold storage? 
And don't forget the costs of keeping the lights on, and the costs of leasing or building mortgage, as nd the taxes to the city. 

When one of the above increases in cost, the price goes up a little. When multiple costs increase, the price goes up a lot. Either the price tises considerably, or the restaurant closes.
Honestly I‚Äôm upset this went over everyone‚Äôs heads. Wish I had some Reddit points to give you an award.. alas here‚Äôs my only option ‚≠êÔ∏èenjoy it.

Seriously. Gnocchi (handmade pasta in general but definitely gnocchi) is a messy pain in the bloody arse!

Anybody who's has made it knows you're cleaning that shit for a week!
My Italian grandmother is rolling over in her grave. Just like she had to hand roll each individual gnocchi!
I don't think that's what they are saying. It's as labor intensive as fresh pasta, which no one seems to balk at paying premium for.
No one said it's *not* labor intensive but it is mighty interesting how people recognize one is labor intensive and willing to pay for it while saying the other is just some ""chickpeas and rice.""¬†


I said a handful of gnocchi to illustrate the price point per volume of flour vs the cost of importing spices that are not grown in the US. Considering how much frozen pasta and red sauce restaurants use


""Indian food"" is a very large umbrella of regional dishes that require quite a bit of flavor and chemistry knowledge to master and it would be akin to me saying that the labor and time it takes for all day pasta sauce to develop properly is about the same for each ""curry"" to be done well. We can both agree making gnocchi and babysitting pasta sauce for 5 hours are two different classes of labor.


Obviously, restaurant cooking is not home cooking so cook times are different. But the expectation that Chinese, Mexican, or Indian food should be cheaper than French or Italian or the price of a burger at a sports bar is ridiculous.¬†



I invite you to find a recipe that isn't watered down and you'll quickly realize why one cuisine requires learning how to use a pressure cooker properly to eat at a reasonable hour, and the other does not.
Spices. Indian dishes have like 10 spices to start then oil and more spices.

Even Google knows: 

In Manhattan, Indian food can be perceived as expensive, particularly compared to some other cuisines, due to factors like ingredient costs, labor-intensive preparation, and the need for imported spices. 


Here's a more detailed breakdown:


Spice Costs:
Many Indian dishes rely on unique and often expensive spices like saffron, cardamom, and fenugreek, which can be costly, especially when imported. 


Labor-Intensive Preparation:
Traditional Indian cooking often involves lengthy preparation times and complex techniques, contributing to higher labor costs. 


Restaurant Pricing:
Indian restaurants, especially those offering higher-end experiences, may have higher prices to reflect the cost of ingredients, labor, and the restaurant's overhead.
Longer prep times for ingredients and many dishes require stages of cooking.

Meat dishes often use marinated meat. Spices might be toasted (5 min). Making the masala base (10-20 min). Cooking down base ingredients dish is comprised of like the meat and vegetables (10-20 min). Cook/stew time (10-20 min). Not to mention the balancing of all the different flavors some of the dishes require.

Overhead, prep/cook time, and the varied palates that are satisfied are why it's so labor intensive. And you're not finding some of these ingredients at any supermarket which increases the cost.
Alright then why is pasta regularly $34/plate?¬†
So damn great

I heard the owner punched some guy or something. I met him at the other Nirvanis they opened on 27 and he gave me and my friend a free pizza

It's all take out but Delhi Garden on 27 is absolutely 100% worth checking out and taking home to eat (or at a table in nearby Johnson Park if the weather's nice).

If you want to eat it at a restaurant though Spice Culture in South Plainfield (Hadley Center) is pretty damn good. Best paneer dishes I've ever had.
This is why I Reddit. ¬†Great insider info.¬†
If you shop LIDL had frozen Indian meals packed with protein. I had to stop eating tho since they changed the oil they used to soy.


They had spicy spinach paneer, so friggin good.
Not sacrilege, Trader Joe's has tasty stuff lol
Care to share the recipe?! üôèüèΩ
Yeah I‚Äôve gotten some variety. I feel like I can‚Äôt barely eat what I order- though I‚Äôve been to a place where I would say the servings were notably smaller that what I expected. But I remember that place being billed as being ‚Äúnicer‚Äù than the average Indian food restaurant
it didn‚Äôt used to be that way in nj, but unfortunately covid was the final nail in the 24 hour diner coffin :(

i do very much miss the 3am taco truck meals from when i lived in queens
Yup. I was a few subway stops away. Used to jump on the train or grab a green cab and get some late night halal, momos, etc. After a few years there, we moved to Bay Ridge. Had a phenomenal halal cart a few minutes walk, late night pizza, taco trucks, etc.

Now I'm in the burbs. It's nice to have a yard and a quiet block, but I desperately miss the access to great foods from so many different cuisines.
Had a laugh since eating a hoagie from Wawa in the parking lot is a 'NJ thing' apparently.


I can't do that, eat in the car.¬†


Never got to enjoy teas from those places, I would now though.
It‚Äôs such a shame that in The Land of Diners, there are so few left that are 24/7. That used to be the best way to unwind on nights (well, mornings!) coming back from a night out in the city
I started infusing smoke (dhungar) into the curry base recently and it's a game changer. Ideally the chicken should also be marinated and grilled before introducing into the sauce, but that's an additional 30mins.
Thanks!
The boxed masala's are incredible, specially if you don't cook Indian on the regular. My mom and I will always use a bit of the boxed mix and add additional seasonings to bring spice level up, and make it closer to the regional version of the dish, but the base flavors are generally really good on the boxed mixes.
They (used to - they were temp closed for the past few months and just reppened, not sure what changed) have a really good lumch special. Was like $15 for a curry of your choice, came with a side (chickpeas or whatever), basmati rice, a piece of naan, usually like a samosa and a cup of rice pudding plus a can of soda. Good portions. Worth checking out if youre home during the week at lunchtime.
They clarified it was temporary and then recently reopened it seems, been seeing them posting on socials agaim as of this week.
Aiight thx man

Bullshit. Go visit a local Indian store and check the price of spices, will be around $1 to $5 for 100 gm packs. Much cheaper when u buy in bulk and get it from India.
It's not at equivalent level restaurants. It's 15-25 depending on of you added meat to it

Are you close to Elmwood Park? Also found a place called Baba Tikka. And if you're near Secaucus, Food Street is absolutely amazing, featuring Lahori street food and fairly affordable. Not sure if you'll find Butter Chicken at all Pakistani places, but trust me as someone who grew up with Pakistani/North Indian cuisine, there is so much more to experience!
Lahore in Seacus and Food Street are supposed to be good. I haven't had it myself but have heard good things.
You're lumping all small business owners into one pot. Don't buy from that place and teach them a lesson with your money.
Check out Delhi Garden. Food is great and portions are good too.
Not gonna lie, my lizard brain said ""red = spicy = yummy"" but this was unnaturally red lol
Yeah, it might have a reddish tinge due to some spices but it should be a brown color. 

I'm pretty sure it was vindaloo...either way I've never seen an Indian dish that color before, nor after that day.
That's awesome. It's not easy!
Our local mediocre to terrible pizza places sell oily pasta for $20 for way worse quality without meat so not sure what sit down restaurants you're getting $25 pasta with meat at.
It's been 12 hours and still no chai, smh.

Flour. To be fair, I'm lazy and get bored easily.

That's so interesting you feel that way about Indian food. I find that if I have the ingredients and spice mixes, it's very quick. Like with most Asian food, I find the time is in the prep. Though I haven't used a tandoor or made any of those long stews, but I don't see them served in most restaurants either. I know Chana or bhindi masala, for example, is a relatively quick execution.
I was super hopeful there was an Akron, NJ but alas.....closest I got. Not too far from home.

PSA: Not all solar agreements are what they seem. Here‚Äôs what to watch out for,"I‚Äôve been in the solar and roofing world for over a decade, and lately I‚Äôve been seeing a lot more homeowners get excited about going solar‚Äîwhich is great. But I‚Äôve also seen a big uptick in people signing contracts they don‚Äôt fully understand, especially when it comes to ownership vs. PPAs.

A neighbor recently asked me to look over their agreement. They were under the impression they were buying the system. But what they had was actually a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). That means the solar company installs and owns the system, and the homeowner just pays monthly for the energy it produces.

Here‚Äôs where it gets tricky:

In the fine print, the agreement stated that all financial benefits‚Äîlike the 30% federal tax credit, renewable energy credits (RECs), and utility rebates‚Äîbelonged entirely to the provider, not the homeowner. And because it was a PPA, they‚Äôd also have no option to claim those benefits later. Just 25 years of payments for power they‚Äôll never own.

To be clear, PPAs aren‚Äôt bad. They can work well for some people, especially if you‚Äôre not eligible for the tax credit or don‚Äôt want any upfront costs. But a lot of homeowners sign thinking they‚Äôre getting one thing‚Äîand they‚Äôre actually getting something very different.

Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown that might help:
	‚Ä¢	PPA ‚Äì No system ownership. You pay for the power, but don‚Äôt get the tax credit or incentives. No maintenance worries, but also no equity.
	‚Ä¢	Loan (Ownership) ‚Äì You finance the system and own it outright after it‚Äôs paid off. You qualify for the tax credit and other incentives, and long-term savings are usually higher.
	‚Ä¢	Lease ‚Äì Similar to a PPA. Fixed monthly payment, no ownership or incentives, but lower barrier to entry.

I‚Äôm posting this because I‚Äôve just seen too many people unknowingly give up the financial upside of solar. It‚Äôs important to ask questions, read every section of the contract, and understand what you‚Äôre actually committing to.

If anyone‚Äôs reviewing solar proposals and wants a second set of eyes, I‚Äôm always happy to help make sense of it. Just shoot me a message. No agenda‚Äîjust looking out.

Stay smart and stay skeptical. Some of these contracts are written to be confusing.",0.99,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jjt9ii/psa_not_all_solar_agreements_are_what_they_seem/,49,1jjt9ii,2025-03-25 20:21,"I worked in the field for a little bit. I had just gotten sober and didn‚Äôt really know any better. I quickly learned how shady they are. For every 1 trustworthy company, there are 10 shady ones.
Any recommendations on decent companies in NJ? I've been looking and have not found any that stand out so far.
It's too bad the government is not looking out for us.... Going to avoid this BS until the gov can get a handle on the shady solar business.
If you are breaking even on the price/electric bill at the 10-15 year, the company is making a good profit off u... sweet spot for solar to make sense is if u break even at the 6-10 year, anything more than that its stupid and a waste
Every time I got a quote, the break even point was over 10 years and the amount to finance was higher than my average monthly usage.

Plus, putting anything on my roof doesn't make me feel comfortable.

I'll pass for the foreseeable future.
Yea this is typical for solar leases. It's how these companies make money.  If a company offers to put panels and the system on your house for free,  there is obviously some catch to it.
And this is why you read fine print people. Yes, I read fine print and crossed out things that are not right as pre conversion that have sellers. And I make them circle and sign it. Salesmen think they are slick, take your time read everything. Make them sweat to get the sale.
Integrity Solar Solutions. I just had 19 panels installed for 19k. Paid a third down and financed the rest for 5 years. Expected to recover about $900/yr back from the orange Rockland based on what we generate versus actually use.
Is energy sage a good site to use for solar installers?
Sun Nova was door knocking in our neighborhood the other week - They got my wife‚Äôs ear for a few but I told them I‚Äôm not interested. Pushy kids they were‚Ä¶ I had to boldly proclaim I‚Äôm not interested after he gave me the side eye as if I was crazy cause I wasn‚Äôt interested in hearing their schpeel.
I worked for a solar company for a month before I realized they did this stuff to the poorer folks. My old company, from my understanding, would get the rights to your roof in exchange of not paying for solar panels and paying them for your electricity.
Just like Andersen Windows, a solar vendor sending people door to door or massively advertising is most likely paying for all those marketing costs by overcharging customers to cover those costs. Now solar is a bit more obscure because people may not understand or research all of the incentives available.

But as with windows if you get a few competitive quotes you should get at least one trustworthy vendor that will lay out all the details for you to easily understand, thus making it clear what the actual cost difference is. Obviously too given the cost & commitment period you should also do some research of your own, even Reddit is a great resource to avoid pitfalls others have shared.
Thank you. That‚Äôs very kind.
Did you lease or buy? I bought from sunnova and I get to keep my own tax. Credit and SRECs
I used to work for the renewable energy program.  be sure to read things VERY carefully.  Make sure you get net metering, make sure you aren't buying the power from your own panels, make sure you are getting SRECs (if still available).

systems are WAY cheaper than when I did this work (over 20 years ago), so I would probably pay for the system outright.

make sure you have a southish facing surface with NO obstructions (12.5 SSE @ 35degree angle is ideal).  even a small amount of obstruction will drastically reduce output.
Hey OP, any interest in doing a ground mount in Monmouth County? My usage, house and roof aren‚Äôt really ideal for solar, but I have a decent amount of property that I can throw some panels on.
They usually offer both ways, many people go with the cheaper PPA and don't realize what else is involved. I went with the purchase plan, which does cost more, but you get the SRECs (or whatever they call them today). You also get a better tax credit if you purchase the system.

One thing that people don't realize is the salesman doesn't make more selling one way or the other, he's just giving you the prices either way, the higher monthly payment for purchasing is usually a turnoff for the buyer.
When you sell the home, the new owner is now responsible for making the payments? Some might see that as a negative.
Thank you for posting this. I agree, more people need to be aware of such arrangements and terms when going solar. I am fortunate enough to be able to financially afford my own system and I am the owner. I was able to obtain all incentives. Some people are aware and agree to these terms and are happy because they would not be able to afford a system as is. Other people are not aware and need to understand what they are accepting.

Additionally, the big thing to be aware of in the terms is when you sell the house. My brother-in-law, had a nightmare selling his past father's house due to him being locked into a PPA worse than this. Essentially, the new homeowner had to also accept the terms of the solar system installed when purchasing the house. This means they had to accept the loan of the installed solar system and the same terms. It turned out to be a nightmare.
Yep, I actually got into solar through the back door, as a roofer. I‚Äôve worked with a number of solar companies over the years, and I‚Äôve been burned more times than I can count. I‚Äôve had tens of thousands of dollars in work go unpaid or flat-out taken from me. So I completely get where you‚Äôre coming from.
Energy Sage is a good resource if you‚Äôre just starting out. They have a lot of helpful articles and I think they also collect install data so they have info on installers and likely costs from these installers and reviews as well. This helps with comparing different providers. I used it 4 years ago and called up all the installers that it provided, then ended up using one of the 6 I spoke with.
What exactly are you looking for?
Yes, there are some who are still reputable (thankfully). Shoot me a dm, I‚Äôll direct you depending on where and what you need.
I see SunRun all over my neighborhood.  Seems like almost everyone with panels around me use them.  I also know some of the national companies will sub out the installation to local companies, so not sure if that's what's going on here or what.  But literally all I see is SunRun around here (hudson county).
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever been a government in history who has ever truly looked out for it people. lol Although, the 30% federal tax credit is sweet (Assuming that you have the tax appetite for it). In terms of state, jersey is currently offering about 85 bucks per 1000 kW that the system produces.
Breaking even in 6‚Äì10 years is ideal, but not always realistic depending on roof size, shading, local rates, and whether it‚Äôs a loan or cash deal. A breakeven point in year 10‚Äì12 is still solid when you consider 13‚Äì15+ years of free power after that. Even if the company profits, that doesn‚Äôt mean the homeowner loses‚Äîespecially as utility rates keep rising. Most folks don‚Äôt expect a 2‚Äì3 year ROI like a stock. It‚Äôs a long-term hedge against inflation. If the system‚Äôs producing well past break-even, it‚Äôs doing its job.
Yeah, I totally get that. I‚Äôm in roofing, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of solar installs where they used really cheap mounting hardware that can cause problems down the line. Not all roof attachments are the same, and that part usually gets glossed over.

With utility rates going up 20% this year, it might push more people to revisit solar, but I always tell folks‚Äîif you‚Äôre thinking ownership, try to avoid the bundled financing. Those loans usually come with big dealer fees. You can often save a good chunk by asking for the cash price and using your own loan or HELOC instead.

Just sharing what I‚Äôve seen from my side of the industry.
You‚Äôre right‚Äî‚Äúfree‚Äù usually comes with strings. A lease or PPA might sound appealing up front, but the trade-off is giving up ownership, incentives, and long-term savings. I always tell people, if it sounds too good to be true, slow down and ask more questions. There‚Äôs almost always a catch buried somewhere in the details.
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Reading the fine print is one of the most underrated things people can do before signing anything. I‚Äôve reviewed contracts where homeowners thought they were buying a system, but the fine print told a totally different story. Good on you for slowing it down and holding them accountable.
It‚Äôs a pay to play site. Send me a dm, I‚Äôll help guide you.
Totally get it. The door-knocking approach has become super common, and I‚Äôve seen firsthand how aggressive some of these teams can be. A lot of them are following a script and chasing commissions, not taking the time to explain what‚Äôs actually in the agreement. You‚Äôre not crazy for being cautious‚Äîhonestly, it‚Äôs smart.
That checks out. I‚Äôve seen similar setups where homeowners unknowingly gave up rights to incentives or even their roof space. It‚Äôs tough because those types of deals are often aimed at folks who are just trying to save money, but they don‚Äôt realize what they‚Äôre giving up long-term. Appreciate you speaking up about it.
I‚Äôve seen a lot of those same high-overhead, high-commission structures‚ÄîRenewal by Andersen is definitely one of the more extreme examples. Some solar outfits run the same playbook: big marketing spend, layered commissions, and financing that buries the real cost.
Really solid advice here. A lot of what you said still gets overlooked today‚Äîespecially the part about buying your own power through a PPA. I always tell folks, if you can swing ownership, especially with today‚Äôs pricing, it‚Äôs usually the smartest move long-term.
Definitely an option if you‚Äôve got the space. Ground mounts work great when the roof isn‚Äôt ideal‚Äîhappy to take a look if you ever want a second opinion.
great points. I‚Äôve found a lot of folks lean toward the PPA just because the lower payment sounds easier‚Äîbut don‚Äôt realize what they‚Äôre giving up. Ownership costs more upfront, but the long-term value and incentives usually outweigh it
it really depends on how the system was acquired. If it was purchased outright‚Äîespecially during the home purchase....there wouldn‚Äôt be any payments at all, just the benefit of lower electric bills.

But if it‚Äôs a financed system, and especially one that‚Äôs oversized for the new homeowner‚Äôs needs, that monthly payment can feel like a burden if not properly explained. When done right, it can actually add value, but having that transparency is key.
Great point! That‚Äôs def a hurdle depending on how the pie is cut. Fortunately with you as the owner of yours is an easy out with the sale of the home plus, in NJ, those srecs are yours for that 15yr period. Even after you sell the home!
I just got an install in Union County NJ. Happy with the installer I used. And got some good quotes from others that I didn‚Äôt go with for one reason or another but seemed very legit. I used EnergySage for quotes as well. Can‚Äôt recommend installers on here but feel to contact.
Solar, batteries and possible roof replacement. Roof is about 18-20 yrs old now.
So like $500/yr.  I mean it is money but rather just not deal with these aholes.
With the major rate hike coming in June, I'm wondering how that affects projected break even timelines.

I really want to pull the trigger on outright ownership of solar panels...
In my line of work I always read the fibe print. Matter of habit. Got screwed once, and it all it took.
Pay to play?? Isn‚Äôt the site free?
Yeah, just bear in mind, my time in the program was over 20 years ago now.  It was wildly different, we were offering 70% rebates on systems, but they were nearly 10x more expensive per watt.
FYI, NJ converted from SRECS to TRECS now. Same thing. Easier to do
Shoot me a dm, happy to guide you.
It‚Äôs way better, like right away 20% better and that‚Äôs before next year‚Äôs rate increase (only 1/3 of the supply is contracted at a time so it‚Äôll be going up more, at least until more supply can come online). You‚Äôll definitely want to get solar before the state incentive changes again.
For users. Yes. But similar to the better business bureau. For instance a business cannot be accredited on a better business bureau. Unless they pay the $500+ a year fee. Go figure."

At this point, nobody knows.  There's some chatter about the TSA being instructed to use discretion if they allow the May 7th implementation to go into effect.  But if you have a passport/passport card, you should bring it on your trip.  By the way, you'd need to present it at boarding in Florida, not upon landing in NJ.  If they were to enforce, you wouldn't be allowed to board the plane.

So, do you have any of these instead?  Having flown with someone who lost their ID on a trip you can still fly but be ready for enhanced screening.
It doesn't matter where you are going. You will need a compliant ID to board the aircraft. TSA asks for ID and your boarding pass before you go through security.  

If you don't have one, you need to show a passport. There are a few [other options](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification) like an ID issued by the federal government if you happen to have one.
If that was me I wouldn't risk it with just a non-REAL license. 

I reckon May 7 is going to be a complete cluster**** at the airports.
You still have time to get the real ID before you leave
I got to the airline and realized I had forgotten my ID at home, I can‚Äôt remember what happened but they basically just pulled me to the side and questioned me for a bit and I was still able to fly
Do you have a passport? If not, you might be able to get one in time. That is your safest bet. Why risk it?
You will be fine. Just arrive a little early for extra verification.
Just get a real id license, it's not that difficult

If the govt doesnt push real id requirement for the billionth time, then you'd be unable to return via flight without other documents. Can always amtrak :D

Was 20 years not enough notice for everyone?
That I don't have currently. Never went outside the USA and don't know if I will ever tbh since that's expensive as hell lol. But I could bring other documentation if that helps? Such as my social security card? Not sure if it'll change anything, but I'm very good at holding onto my documents and keeping them safe so at least if I bring it I know I won't lose it during travel.
So I don't have those IDs seeing as I'm just a usa born resident and don't have any sort of documentation of citizenship registration. My family has been here since the very early 1900s so we're all just natural born citizens. I'm also not a government employee or military so I don't have those IDs.

But I do plan to arrive early anyway to my flight, as I always do so. I'll plan to make the extra 3 hours instead of my usual 2.5 as the site says.

Thank you!! I do appreciate it!! And I'll bring some other documents like my social security card as I'd said to another person specifically so I can help verify my information if need be. I'm very good at keeping documents organized and safe so I know I won't lose it on my trip.
> It doesn't matter where you are going. You will need a compliant ID to board the aircraft.

This is a complete lie. You can fly with a Costco card. You will continue to be able to fly with a Costco card. It requires an added 30 minutes for verification.

This
It'd be easier if the NJ DMV website had any appointments available at all in any capacity. But not a single one is listed. Anywhere. Shit.
The point of asking this question is because DMV is playing games and doesn't have enough ""appointment"" slots for REAL IDs.  It is ridiculous in its own right, but so is waiting until the last minute to care about something we've known about for years...
no üòÇ
When they haven‚Äôt had any appointments for us to get the ids, yeah, it wasn‚Äôt enough. Also, they should have been issuing us the real ids upon our renewals the last few years and haven‚Äôt. I need a real ID because I‚Äôm flying soon and my passport is expired and I cannot get an appointment and I‚Äôve been trying for one forever. It‚Äôs bullshit.
It's going to come down to how the TSA wants to proceed.  This is direct from the TSA.gov website:

> Don‚Äôt Have Your Acceptable ID?    
In the event you arrive at the airport without acceptable identification (whether lost, stolen, or otherwise), you may still be allowed to fly.    
The TSA officer may ask you to complete an identity verification process which includes collecting information such as your name and current address to confirm your identity. If your identity is confirmed, you will be allowed to enter the screening checkpoint, where you may be subject to additional screening.
You will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint if you choose to not provide acceptable identification, you decline to cooperate with the identity verification process, or your identity cannot be confirmed.    
TSA recommends individuals without acceptable identification arrive at least three hours in advance of their flight time.
Yes it will expedite the verification process.
If enforcement goes into effect it will be nationwide. Prepare to travel by bus or train. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you are not leaving the country (you need a passport for that).
we are fucking doomed as a society, aren't we.
You should probably have a passport these days though, Canada is not a far drive away and if you, say, go to Niagra Falls or something you would want to cross the border to see the falls.  Not to mention seeing any countries in the Carribean that are a 90 minute flight away.
We don't know how it's going to work once it rolls out. It's not a complete lie, it's what the government is saying the process is. At worst, it's simply incorrect. At best, it may actually be accurate.
Per [DHS.gov](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs): ""Travelers who do not present a REAL ID-compliant license or acceptable alternative beginning May 7, 2025 will not be permitted through the security checkpoint.""
Yes exactly, thank you. 

>In the event you arrive at the airport without acceptable identification (whether lost, stolen, or otherwise), you may still be allowed to fly. 

>The TSA officer may ask you to complete an identity verification process which includes collecting information such as your name and current address to confirm your identity. If your identity is confirmed, you will be allowed to enter the screening checkpoint, where you may be subject to additional screening.
Check online at around 7am. It seems they release appointments daily around that time. If you wait til later, the appointments will be gone. At least that was my experience.
Real ID licenses have been issued since 2019... when they push the TSA real ID requirement again this year, don't wait lol
They have been issuing it on renewals, that's how I got mine. You had to go in with the extra ID. The only reason there aren't enough appointments is people waited until the last minute.
We do know because TSA has already confirmed it.

Why lie?

Yea im agreeing with you! Just giving OP the link for reassurance
Only available by difficult to obtain appointments. Also 2019 was mostly a testing phase with barely any issued. Almost all of 2020 they were pretty much shutdown. So that‚Äôs 4 years they have only been sporadically available.
Well it was a pandemic and ever since it became safe to go in person there haven‚Äôt been any appointments. I did my renewal recently and I wasn‚Äôt given the option to upgrade it. Not eligible for another renewal now.
Confirmed what? You can use a Costco ID?  And again, I don't think it was a lie, I think the other poster at worst was incorrect, but I don't believe that to be intentional. Why would they lie?

Yes.

https://thepointsguy.com/airline/forms-of-identification-that-will-get-you-through-airport-security/

This policy is not changing.

What is changing is that a standard drivers license will be treated like a costco card - extra verification will be required.

The list of IDs they have on there does not include a Costco ID, and it also says the real ID thing goes into effect in 2021, so you linked an incorrect, out of date article. It's also the points guy, not TSA.

Careless Driving Ticket for understandably normal circumstance (any Advice?),"I was going around 75-80 m/h (in 287), driving in normal traffic (Monday 11:30 AM) at the same speed with the rest of the cars in the left lane (the speed limit must have been 65 m/p). I wasn‚Äôt passing any cars or speeding extensively, I was simply following the remaining cars (which were going the same speed) with good amount of gap. Every other car (3 or 4) front of me passed the cop around same speed but I was pulled over (my back was empty too). Only issue I may have done is not slow downing enough before the rest of the cars.

I read all the other Careless Driving posts in here but I couldn‚Äôt reach a solid conclusion‚Äîthere wasn‚Äôt any post that received a ticket like this too. Should I just pay the ticket, plea innocence, or pay for the driving course take away the points?

Everyone I talked to speaks as it‚Äôs an unlucky incident that gave the officer an opportunity to write me a ticket. I‚Äôm just concerned about my history not being clean now, and also whether it would increase my insurance (but I read this depends on whether the insurance company decides to increases)

Any advice? Thanks in advance.",0.15,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jjq6ug/careless_driving_ticket_for_understandably_normal/,18,1jjq6ug,2025-03-25 18:17,"You were speeding and were unlucky. Either don't speed, or accept that once in awhile you're probably going to get pulled over and pay for it.
You were traveling in the left lane above the speed limit.  Easy target for pulling over.  The left lane is the passing lane, not a travel lane.
Don't speed
Go to court and ask the prosecutor to plead to a non point violation.
If you're going 80 in a 65, you're gonna get pulled over. Plea unsafe driving or whatever the deal is nowadays to take the course and remove any points. That way when you get pulled over again, you can say you have no points and they will most likely cut you some slack (within reason).

If the other drives started jumping off a cliff, would you follow?

>it‚Äôs an unlucky incident that gave the officer an opportunity to write me a ticket. 

You broke the law. Take responsibility for your own actions.
Talk to prosecutor. Worst case you take the points, pay for the online course to shave points and you‚Äôll receive a discount on your car insurance.
My advice is to take ownership of your actions. You seem to be downplaying it or excusing it by repeatedly mentioning how normal it is and everyone else is doing it.  Follow the speed limit, not other cars 

>Only issue I may have done is not slow downing enough before the rest of the cars.

No, going above the speed limit was an issue. It wasn't an unlucky incident, it was a known risk that comes along with speeding.
And stay out of the left lane
I know this post isn't asking for a lesson (of course, they never do), but I always find it funny when people are panicking because they broke the law and got caught. We are fully aware of what we are doing and yet concludes that law does not apply to us... well it does, and actions have consequences. That, besides the increased risk they unnecessarily put other families in.
Are there any suggestions you can give if I had to the court (about how to speak and approach to the judge, and the prosecutors before the appearance)? I read it‚Äôs important to speak to prosecutors priorly (to keep the case short and clean)
This. The speed limit doesn't suddenly disappear when roads are less crowded.
I was driving in a normal matter though. If I were speeding very much I would understand endangering others, but it‚Äôs a general rule to speed an additional 5-10 miles (especially on a highway). I   reached 80 without noticing, otherwise I was at a constant normal speed with everyone else.
[deleted]
That's a weird way to spell ""I was doing 15 over the speed limit""
80mph is endangering others - that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs only allowed on some portion of the whole US roads. I see what you mean though and I acknowledge that driving above speed limit is the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. But it is good to remember that what appears normal isn‚Äôt necessarily lawful - mass effect will lead you to where you shouldn‚Äôt be. Ultimately, no one is supposed to ignore the law, let alone break it. And while others ahead of you got lucky, you‚Äôre the one they had their radar on. A few mph above limits is not easy to immediately spot, but 80mph even in a 65 zone should have been noticeable. I hope you get away with just a fine and no points - but more importantly that you chill on the road and only allow you a few mph above limits. I ride the right lane like this and it‚Äôs actually quite pleasant, losing just a few seconds compared to those racing the left lane.
Thank you. I will see what I can do
You are right. I sadly got emotional over this as I have been failing or not succeeding at certain things in my life that I want yet haven‚Äôt been doing properly. I will see what I can do. Thanks for the response.

Jersey Governor November Considerations: Importance of Unaffiliated Voters,"In my prior posts, I noted that both Josh Gottheimer (NJ5) and Mikie Sherrill (NJ11) have no pull with the Unaffiliated voters. Unaffiliated votes are valuable in November, especially since Elon Musk will try to tap that group, and well as GOTV for Republicans. 

One Democratic candidate who has had success with groups out side of the party is Steven Fulop. 

vernor role since 1954-1970. 

Phil Murphy‚Äôs run in 2020 significantly underperformed the Democrat/Republican ratio of 60% versus 40%.

Murphy 51%
Ciattarelli  48%

This is most likely because of the Unaffiliates voting for Jack Ciattarelli. In Jersey, Unaffiliated is the second largest group at 2.4 million registered voters, and not carrying this group means a likely loss in November. 

Unaffiliated 2,412,627 
Democrat 2,448,324 
Republican 1,614,140 

Going back to the party flip pattern in the recent years: 
A lot of the blame goes the Democratic Party. 
Corzine was a particularly weak candidate. 
Murphy had no prior municipal experience. Actually, neither did Corzine.

Both were entrenched machine politicians who bought their way into power.

In November, track record is important to gain votes beyond the party line. When you watch the prior debates, do you think Josh, Mikie, Ras, or Sean can gain meaningful Unaffiliated voters?

In my opinion, Fulop is the only one who has that ability.",0.71,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jjpkxy/jersey_governor_november_considerations/,12,1jjpkxy,2025-03-25 17:53,"Fulop‚Äôs my guy, but if he dropped dead tomorrow my vote in the primary would be ‚Äúanyone but Gottheimer‚Äù
Maybe I'm misremembering, but I don't remember Murphy campaigning that much during his second election. It was really strange to me cause I saw Jack everywhere but nothing for Murphy. I felt like he didn't try which was scary as a resident here cause Jack came really close. Hopefully we can get a candidate as a Dem who will bring some Charisma instead of lame ducks like Goth, Spiller, or Sweeney.
Fulop campaign is overestimating the influence of Reddit.
ill wait to see who the state unions back.
Just please don't forget about your local state legislative representatives. Just like US Congress, it's the State Legislature that is actually developing the laws and changes to laws. So those need to be properly represented even more so than the governor. No one seems to pay much attention to those until they are standing in the voting booth.
You know Murphy outran Fulop in Jersey City in '21, right?

Murphy won the city 36,592 to 7,636 (81.4% to 17%). Fulop won it 28,562 to 13,741 (67.29% to 32.37%). Not sure why you think that means he'd fare better with independents than candidates who've spent their entire political careers running in more competitive, partisan ground.
I completely forgot Richard Codey existed.
Anyone but Spadea.
Gottheimer is trying to pull a Fetterman - democrats need to be cautious. I have no doubts he‚Äôs going to run the state as if he‚Äôs a republican if he wins
I think the campaign is correctly assessed that Reddit has pretty limited influence in this kind of thing. 

There are a couple of us who support the mayors campaign who are also active on Reddit, and a few of us are speaking up, but, I don't believe there's anything official from the campaign outside of Steve doing an AMA a couple of months ago.
I have no affiliation with any campaign. I am a voter, a registered Democrat.
If you look at how he's been voting as a member of the house it's clear Josh is still a Democrat. He's not great, but he's decently consistent with the party. I don't think he's anywhere near the best option for the Democrat primary, but he'd be a lot better than Ciattareli.¬†"

Traveling on PATH trains during midnight during layover,"Hey everyone,

I have a few questions I haven‚Äôt been able to easily find consistent answers for online. I have a 10-hour layover in Newark, starting at 11pm and want to be back by 5/6 am (Brutal). I'm planning meeting up with some buddies in NYC, and I was thinking about taking the PATH trains from Penn Station to somewhere like the World Trade Center station. But i haven't found consistent information online about the PATH trains operating hours. My main questions are (May be dumb questions):

* Do the trains between Newark and NYC operate 24 hours?
* Are there any better alternatives for traveling during those hours?
* Is it safe to attempt a midnight trip into NYC?

Any insights or recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!",1.0,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jjn5we/traveling_on_path_trains_during_midnight_during/,16,1jjn5we,2025-03-25 16:14,"They are 24 hours, it's basically that or Uber.

That when bridge and tunnelers head in to drink and bars close at 4AM so everyone is coming back at 5AM or starting their commute to work.
>Do the trains between Newark and NYC operate 24 hours?

The PATH trains do operate during those hours, [typically 30-40 minutes between each departure on the overnight](https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/schedules-maps.html), and about 25-30 minutes travel time. 

Between the airport & Newark Penn you can go by train, bus, or taxi/car services.  Your exact schedule will dictate your choices better.  


If something goes wrong I would have a handy ""plan B"" (like Uber/Lyft) ready to execute.  If the PATH train taking you back to the airport breaks down or the train crew is hurt, then you may not see the replacement for them until the next scheduled run, ~40 minutes later. 


>Are there any better alternatives for traveling during those hours?

If you actually want to go to WTC, then PATH is pretty direct and cheap.  If you want to go more uptown in NYC, then [busses can take you to 42nd street (PABT - Port Authority Bus Terminal) or the general area](https://www.newarkairport.com/to-from-airport/public-transportation).    
NJ Transit Trains / AMTRAK trains can take you up to Penn Station, at about 34th Street.  

Car services and taxis will cost you a bundle, especially when you factor in tolls and the congestion pricing fees.  They are very direct, but expensive. 


>Is it safe to attempt a midnight trip into NYC?

Usually it is reasonably safe. Don't be silly by displaying lots of money or expensive flash, and stay aware of your surroundings. Look for exits and emergency phones/alarms in your area in case you need to get help in a hurry.
> I haven't found consistent information online about the PATH trains operating hours. 

Huh? PATH has operated 24/7 for over 80 years. What kind of research did you conduct that told you otherwise? 

Did you not simply try typing ""PATH schedule"" into google and clicking the first link?

https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/schedules-maps.html
You will be fine... Whatcha doing with your bags though?
The only annoying aspect is the PATH at later hours is pretty infrequent and there very well could be points where you're waiting around for a long while. Might be a pain in the ass but you could in theory time it right if you keep eye on times and plan when you go to and fro things.
There is a PATH app that will give you the current wait times for the trains along with other station info

Most of the time, resoling a sneaker isn't worth doing.

NJ5 Calculus,"What happens in terms of events is still similar as NJ11

1. NJ5 seat goes vacant as of January 2026, likely for 3 to 4 months.
2. It is vacant until the special election takes place.
3. Special election determines who takes over the seat for the remainder of 2026.
4. There will be another election for the 2027-2028 term in November.

Josh Gottheimer ran for re-election last year against Mary Jo Guinchard. 
She was the Mayor of Tuxedo Park, NY, and ran for Bergen County Commissioner, and a former Broadway performer.

Josh spent $2.9 million over that cycle. 
Mary Jo spent $330k, almost all self funded.

Results for 2024:

Josh: 54.5%
Guinchard: 43.3%
Margin: 11.2%
Total votes: 382,097

What does NJ5 voter registration look like?

Dem: 56% 
Rep:  44%

As was with NJ11, the results mirror the registration. 
Actually, Josh did slightly worse than the registration.

What is notable regards to NJ5 is Unaffiliated is the largest contingent at 218,442.

So in a special election, we are looking at 57,000 or so turnout. 
If votes are cast as was in 2024, margin is 6300.

Yes, 6300 votes can flip NJ5.

Introduce Elon Musk‚Äîif he spends $1000 per conversion in terms of R GOTV or Unaffiliated, that‚Äôs around $6 million. He can likely flip this by spending $7 or 8 million, which for him is trivial.

See Something Say Something?,Shady looking couple just got out of this Municipal Government vehicle at Vince Lombardi rest stop.  Freshly smashed windshield.  Eek.

I don't know if it's a 911 call, but I would. In my town I would call the police non-emergency number. If they have 311 where you are maybe that's right.
Yes see something say something. It‚Äôs never too late now that you have the plate number, time and place of where they were at
*And* poorly parked? Sheesh‚Ä¶
Yeah that‚Äôs stolen
Call the non-emergency police number, let them know.
Municipal plates.
The thong that caught my eye is the broken windshield glass on both sides. That's a little sus to me. The bad parking is plain laziness.
How do you know the window is freshly smashed?
Looks like someone was asking for their heads
Any updates?
Interesting
at best, its an officer‚Äôs vehicle that is allowed for personal use and the person driving is significantly negligent. at worst, its stolen. i‚Äôve never gotten in trouble for a good faith non emergency call.
Come on and party tonight
As far as I can see if it‚Äôs a government vehicle chances are pretty good the drivers are the criminals.
is it sad my first thoguhts were oh those numbers must mean some kind of hate speech like 88. Didnt even see the windsheild lol, but the parking job was also distracting me.
That‚Äôs how the mayor of AC and his wife park.  Usually in the handicap spot.
I really wanna know what happened.
Could you be more specific on ""Shady looking couple"". What, specifically, made them shady in your opinion? Maybe describe them.
The jump out boys stopping for some subpar shake shack after their morning job?
It‚Äôs a cop car. Municipal plates. Flashers in the grill and by the rear view mirror.
Wouldn't that car have a GPS tracker?
Just an extra for the new CARS movie. Nothing see here carry on.
Any update? I'm curious
What am I missing?

A person with municipal plates can't stop at a rest stop to take a whiz or get coffee?
Holy FUCK that is some of the worst parking I've ever seen in Jersey. (But in all seriousness, yes, you could report to the Department of Homeland Security, one of their slogans is exactly ""See something, say something."")
Yes?

So this looks like either an unmarked cop car or some other official.
His speed holes need to be in the hood
I thought people only parked like this at the jon bon jovi plaza
Just a good samaritan taking some state resources for a joyride.
Internet full of cucks
The license plate ends in MG, it‚Äôs a municipalities (government) car.
Probably a cop car to begin with, it has MG (Municipal Government) plates.
The distance between those two smashes plus the damage above the right one looks to me (and this is heavily assuming) like they actually hit someone. But it also could just be a baseball bat hit in two spots that align with an adult human body.
Asshole parking job, probably cops
Yeah I would call 911.¬†
Acab.
Many people lack the driving skill to properly park any vehicle larger than a VW beetle. Sometimes a whole line is off-center because one person didn‚Äôt park centered in a space. Seeing so much empty space nearby makes me doubt this was the case. The driver may have been so lazy that he/she did it to make it one less step to the place he/she was going.

From my experience, in NJ, this is Jersey style parking. Nothing to see here
Looks stolen to me, or its some shady cop.
Why do your say that? The window isn't busted out or anything
Also let them know that you have photos of it. Might help.

I had the same first thought. It is a bad parking job, but smashing the windshield is an overreaction.
It took me way too long to realize what the issue was here that warranted calling the cops
One was dressed like the hamburgler, the other dude had a full body tattoo that looked suspiciously like blueprints of a large building.

I feel like it's a safe assumption based on all the other ""clues"" this person has gathered.
It depends. 

Did Purchasing decide to follow instructions, or were they cheap?
Dang, these live action Disney remakes are getting DARK...
The fact the front windshield is smashed and a couple came out of it is very odd. What police vehicles do you see being used for couples to go pick up burgers from a rest stop? I‚Äôve lived in NJ my entire life and have never seen anything like that. If it‚Äôs not stolen it‚Äôs being improperly used and should be reported either way
My dad had a state owned car. He couldn‚Äôt drive it anywhere that wasn‚Äôt to work or to home. So I assume that goes for all agencies. And damage to the car should be reported and fixed, not on the road as a hazard.
And now it‚Äôs on all of us too
Crime is everyone's business. I don't want to live in a state where people go around stealing municipal vehicles, paid for with my own tax money, without repercussions.

I thought that immediately because I thought, they were in an accident, they hit the windshield and then abandoned the car.
And <sigh> prepare to spend a lot of time talking to the cops
It‚Äôs a cop car and a weird looking couple got out of it. If it‚Äôs nothing then it‚Äôs nothing but if it‚Äôs something then they‚Äôll be glad to know about it

""I love it when you talk RICO to me""
Municipal does not mean it's a police vehicle.
This is pretty obviously a local cop car, from the ""MG"" (municipal government) license plate, the antenna above the driver's seat, and the fact that cops buy a lot of this kind of model.
Curious if OP will update but my real thought; you think law enforcement really checks reddit?


I read your comment as sarcasm.
Before I get pissed at people I remind myself of this. Too often have I had to park poorly at my Trader Joes because the guy next to me did, leaving me looking like an asshat when I walk back out.

This is why I no longer get mad at anybody for bad parking. 

I don't know if they were the first one or the one that had a part that way because of somebody else.
I had a boss who always parked his BMW diagonally across two spots ‚Äúso that nobody would ding his car‚Äù. Some people are actually just douche bags. 

On the bright side, birds seemed to really love shitting on his car, specifically.
I am not trying to strengthen my point.
I guess, but there's no reason they would be unmarked. They would probably also have lights. OTOH, a cop car would have the low-profile lights. Can you tell from this angle?  
Would a marked cop car like this be identifiable from this angle?
Not bullet holes.  Someone hit it with a hammer or a bat or something like that. And they maliciously parked badly.

Suggestions for a dinner for about 60 people - within 30 minutes of Princeton,"I'm hoping NJ Redditors can give me some suggestions.

Sunday on 17 outside of football season is a blessing. Never.
Towns should adopt it if they want it. There's no reason for Paramus' wants to affect the whole county. They're even suing American dream for no reason. MetLife breaks the blue laws during football games, no one's ever done anything about that
I dunno. Honestly I'm kinda surprised they've lasted this long, never got the impression that most win Bergen county are that religious. But lasted they have. Truthfully I do think some day it'll happen
People like the break from the never-ending traffic in Bergen county and retail employees like knowing they have a guaranteed day off, but it‚Äôs also a major pain in the backside and creates more traffic the rest of the week, especially on Saturday when it‚Äôs almost impossible to shop anywhere in Bergen county due to the stores being overcrowded. The repeal of blue laws has gotten onto the ballot and failed multiple times so I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll ever be repealed
The county is currently in a lawsuit with the American Dream mall, the decision may have broad implications as far as I know.
They will once Jersey drops full-serve gas.
It would have been a great gesture to small businesses to suspend it for a few months after covid to make up losses.   From that, they could have studied the impact on commerce,  traffic, etc.  I'd be in favor of it with limits - small businesses only - no chains.
No! We love the blue laws!!
Over my dead body.
It should eventually, as its cons outweigh pros.
Weren't they suing because the American Dream mall exploited a loop hole and hasn't been paying taxes? Is that really for no reason?
I‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôre really out of touch if you think residents want to keep the blue laws for strictly religious reasons.
The lawsuit was for being open on Sundays. Paramus doesn't even get taxes from American Dream, only the south bergen county towns do.
Ah, well then they do have a reason, it's just not reasonable nor the same as the other towns."

Yep.
Thanks! I appreciate the help
No problem! I know how stressful it is to figure it all out beforehand so anything to make it easier for someone else lol
Another question if you don't mind. So on KBB it says the car is worth 6k would it be fine to get liability insurance only like dollar a day insurance for example.
It's entirely up to you and I'm not an insurance expert so this is only anecdotal advice, but I think it depends on your situation. I have nearly full coverage on my 2010 car that I paid \~$7k for because an extra $100/month is more worth it to me at my current stage in life as opposed to having to take off of work to potentially buy a newer car for the same amount. I've also seen instances where minimum coverage is reasonable and full coverage becomes insanely expensive for some cars to which I wouldn't think it was worth it. Everyone wishes they had better insurance when they're in an actual accident, but I've had points in my life where an extra $100/month would've absolutely broken me financially, so ultimately it's your call"

If you tell me what you‚Äôre looking to eat I could narrow down a spot for you
I'd say take a nice train ride down to Belmar NJ.

Get a pork roll egg and cheese sandwich at Beckmans deli for breakfast, and an Italian Hot Dog at Sonny's Grille for lunch. 

A bunch of other great spots all in same area also. 
10th Ave Burrito, Lucci Pizza, Beach Haus Brewery, Hoagitos. Anchor Tavern, Federicis Pizza etc

You did say walking distance from a train station. This is it
There's only one place to try the original Italian Hot Dog........Jimmy Buffs. Enjoy!
Westfield, Red Bank, Rahway for lots of places and train.
technically Gronsky's Milk House is near a station. So thats my vote, that place is a vibe.

however my personal favorite bagel stop is the ""hot bagels"" up the road

https://maps.app.goo.gl/XQYsauY35eAps9th7
Best bet would be Hoboken/Downtown Jersey City.
Jimmy Buffs for Italian Hot dogs
Oof. Tough without a car.

You can get a great breakfast sandwich at any deli. Kaiser roll is better suited than a bagel for this. Make sure they use Taylor-branded meat. Wal-Mart /Sam‚Äôs sells non-Taylor branded pork roll, it‚Äôs not as good.

While I appreciate a good Italian dog and a deep fried ripper, my favorite is the Texas Weiner.
Once u said italian hot dog this is the only place to go enjoy
Jimmy Buffs and any decent bagel store.
Taylor ham does not exist. For Italian hotdogs, Tommy's in Elizabeth is up there.
Pork roll is best in south Jersey¬†
Thanks! I'm interested in the Jersey specialties like Italian hot dogs and a well-executed pork roll/Taylor ham sandwich (sorry folks I have no horse in that fight, I am but an interloper) or anything else that I may not know about. 

We have plenty of ethnic food in NYC but I'm guessing there are some specific dishes or variations that may be easier to find in NJ... I've heard rumblings about, for example, pizza with Indian-style toppings. I don't know what I don't know, though.
I don't mind a day trip! This looks like a fun place to explore and those eats look really good. Thanks!
*2 places, Kenilworth and West Orange
Easy enough for me from the PATH... any specific places I should try?
Looks pretty much walkable from the station, too! Thanks!

Edit: why on earth am I being downvoted...?
The bagels and round rolls are better in north Jersey though. And we use the same meat product just call it its correct name.
Journal Square has an awesome hot dog spot by Loews theater, as for Taylor ham/pork roll (idc either) you‚Äôre better off going to small cafes/sandwich shops. I can recommend one in Bayonne (it‚Äôs called little food cafe) which isn‚Äôt too far, just take the light rail from exchange place if you want. I think another great place is Lou‚Äôs diner (I think it‚Äôs called Mauricio‚Äôs now), they have some good stuff.  West side Ave has some nice Filipino food if that interests you as well. 

As for specific dishes localized to NJ I would diner hop as that‚Äôs kinda what we‚Äôre known for (along with malls) and that might be kinda hard without a car. Hoboken has some good places off of Washington street but Hudson county is pretty much a smaller NYC: a bunch of different ethnic groups and restaurants bunched together. 

And regarding the Taylor ham pork roll thing again, I‚Äôve personally had some of the best dishes down south/central Jersey. Good luck and don‚Äôt be afraid to explore!
Looks like either of those mean Ubering. I mean, if I gotta do it, I gotta do it, I guess...
haha, yes!
Yes very easy from the path. I really do not have any specific places in mind unfortunately. Wonder Bagel in Downtown JC comes to mind but that place gets packed.
years ago my boy lived in Elizabeth and i took the train a couple stops from Rahway to Elizabeth to link up with him...when i got off the train, I called my friend because I forgot his address, and there were 3 kids fighting in the parking lot of the train station...i remember being on the phone like ""oh shit, some kids are scrappin"" and he's like ""oh well, take a left at the beatdown, then walk 2 blocks""
people are idiots
The correct name is pork roll¬†
He did
Thank you, this is very helpful! I'm looking up each of the places you mentioned and will definitely be making use of the light rail (something we in NYC unfortunately destroyed decades ago).  And I'm certainly not opposed to taking NJT past JC/Hoboken/etc for farther-away destinations, I'd just prefer not to have to Uber after I get there.

I'm thinking I'll do Little Food Cafe first, since the Taylor ham/pork roll is at the top of my list. There are a few places in NYC [that do it](https://i.imgur.com/HVZTSDB.jpg) but none of them seem to duplicate *exactly* what NJ does (the one in that link, from a bodega on the LES, seems to use an egg mixture instead of whole eggs). 

I did do a little research on my own and saw that Dickie Dee's, which is evidently known for Italian hot dogs, is in Newark and not far from the light rail, but I haven't seen anyone mention it yet so not sure how they are reputationally, although folks on Yelp/Google seem to like them.
It'd be like 30 min walk from Cranford station to Jimmy Buffs in Kenilworth
You can do a short Uber from Orange train station. If you really wanted to you could probably get a bus from Newark Penn"

Sean Spiller‚Äôs ‚Äúcampaign‚Äù for governor is nasty,"If you‚Äôre not familiar with Sean Spiller consider yourself lucky. This guy (former Montclair mayor btw) has been spamming people with mailers and ads for months about his run for governor. But here‚Äôs the kicker: it just came out that despite spending $35 MILLION on this campaign (yes, $35 million), Spiller couldn‚Äôt even qualify for the debate stage‚Ä¶. All that money, and he didn‚Äôt even hit the basic fundraising threshold (580k‚Ä¶)

How‚Äôs this even possible? Well because he has no real campaign. No staff, no fundraising operation, no team‚Äînothing. Seriously. It‚Äôs all coming straight from a $35 million slush fund set up by the NJEA, the teachers union that he is the current president of.

He‚Äôs literally running a ghost campaign. No employees. No real ground support. No grassroots donors. Just a giant pile of union cash funding an artificial campaign to make him look legitimate.

Seriously, what the hell is going on here? Do NJ teachers even realize their union dues are bankrolling this guy‚Äôs vanity project? Does anyone actually support this? We‚Äôve got plenty of corruption in this race already (Sweeney, Gottheimer say hi). But at least those guys have actual campaigns.

He‚Äôs not gonna win, obviously, because he has no genuine support. But this whole thing needs more eyes on it because it‚Äôs just sick and exactly what we need to boot out of public office.

Anyone from Montclair will tell you that Spiller was a disengaged, ineffective mayor.
He clearly isn‚Äôt going to win and is just taking attention away from people who are trying to decide between Baraka and Fulop or Sherrill and Sweeney. It‚Äôs just this weird, corrupt, unlikable middle.
>Do NJ teachers even realize their union dues are bankrolling this guy‚Äôs vanity project?¬†

I certainly do.... hence why I do not support this guy at all. I'd also argue that his complete lack of support illuminates the fact that many feel the same way as well. www
Hated him when he was the mayor. I am not sure Montclair residents know how corrupt his administration was. A family member had business in Montclair and they were not so subtly asking for bribes. I get it, building departments in most NJ towns are corrupt, but this was more than  I had ever seen.
I mean marketing is marketing but this dude's literally begging teachers to vote for him by buying school staff's pizza and shit ü§£

On a personal note, hearing about slush funds makes me want to run over to my local 7-11 and grab both Cherry and Coke Slushees üòÅ
I‚Äôm almost at the point of not paying my union dues and leaving the union altogether.

I spend $1500 a year to fund this guy‚Äôs long shot campaign and at the local level our union leaders roll over to admin and violate our contract as well as an instance of violating state law.
This is a sad way to campaign. He should focus on supporting teachers at this point, not running a $35 million campaign that has little support from voters.
NJEA member here. Fully aware that our dues are being used to help fund this guy‚Äôs campaign. The full color mailers we are getting from the NJEA promoting his campaign makes it crystal clear. Not happy at all about this, and he will not be getting my primary vote.
How is Sean Spiller being the president of the NJEA and taking $30 million from them not considered a conflict of interest? This is shady AF. He can‚Äôt even get enough donations from grassroots support to be on the debate stage.
Omg I am so glad someone is saying something. I am a very dependable Dem voter and I‚Äôm literally floored every time a mailer comes to my house. 

I cannot imagine the money spent on this campaign.  I‚Äôve been getting these mailers from Spiller weekly for MONTHS. In addition to seeing his ads on social media. 

Been wondering how he is being funded. Tbh this seems like it should be illegal??? 

I‚Äôm glad people are at least seeing through this but I hope the teachers union is able to oust him for this.
Reeks of corruption. Between him and Sweeney, it's all my junk mail.
And NJEA is paying for his campaign staff. Their in house staff are off running his campaign on NJEA‚Äôs dime (aka, the teachers‚Äô dimes)
I am a public school teacher in NJ and Spiller has given me the ick from the very beginning. Weekly I receive donation requests yet Spiller refuses to come up with any platform on any issue‚Ä¶ including education. On Spiller‚Äôs website, he speaks in general platitudes and his educational platform reads as such:

‚ÄúAs a career teacher, no candidate for governor cares more deeply or personally about education than I do. I‚Äôm a leading voice on New Jersey education policy as the President of the NJEA, and we have the second-ranked pre-K-12 education system in the country. When I‚Äôm serving as our governor, we‚Äôll boost that ranking to first.‚Äù

Spiller does not mention anything about charter school policy, school building infrastructure, administrative bloat, supporting pensions (a slam dunk for teachers) or even how to incentivize more people to become teachers. 

Spiller is an empty vessel just trying to climb the professional ladder.

The two candidates that actually speak to actual issues with deep policy proposals are Steven Fullop and Ras Baraka. Whether it comes to education, housing, reproductive & LGBTQ rights, NJ transit, healthcare or general affordability Fullop and Baraka are the progressive choices that actually appear to be effective candidates/communicators.

Fullop and Baraka have detailed policy platforms that include full PDF pages on their websites. You would think this would be the minimum requirement for someone who is asking to be elected to the highest office in the state, but I guess Spiller disagrees or doesn‚Äôt care enough.

I am attaching the websites of Spiller, Fullop and Baraka for reference.

lol I‚Äôve gotten like 4 of the exact same mailers from him and nothing from anyone else. I was wondering what was up
The week congestion pricing was implemented Spiller had a billboard up on 495 claiming he‚Äôd end it.

That kind of told me everything I needed to know about this dude and his candidacy, much more than the incessant mailers I‚Äôve been receiving for months
My English teacher in 8th grade married him the year I had her and i know I annoyed the shit out of her

I‚Äôm probably not blameless in all this. There‚Äôs probably like a fraction of a percent of me in his villain origin story. 

Sorry guys
I‚Äôve always hated how much money people spend to get elected. It‚Äôs literally like buying your way into office. It promotes too much dishonesty and thievery. On the government salary how are you supposed to pay back that much money or are you planning on misappropriating month from one place to pay back your parties contribution.
[deleted]
I have never even heard of this guy
Huh. He seemee like an interesting candidate that I was intrigued by, but now im wondering if his campaign financing through the teachers union is even entirely legal
Union members should protest him and the current leadership. Toss him out.
Dude was spamming my mailbox and had TV ads up before the presidential election last year. That alone made me not want to vote for him
So I as a teacher said this back in October and was told that I was wrong because it's illegal to use NJEA funds to run his campaign. I can't recall the last time a politician really cared if something is legal or not when it comes to campaigning.

Here's the thing, though...we are in a sticky situation with all the democratic candidates.

1. We need Mikie Sherill to stay in congress. We can't afford to lose a Democrat in congress right now and can't assume we will get another one to take her seat in the event of a special election.
2. I don't trust fulop when it comes to affordable housing so long as he is connected to the kushners.
3. Steve Sweeney still can't be trusted after he helped Chris Christie in 2011
This asshole was my teacher in high school. Total douche then, too. Self-serving as hell and infatuated with himself.
Terrible waste of money
Yea I've been getting mailers and seen TV commercials for this guy.  Heard be wasn't very effective as mayor tho so I won't be voting for him. I think he's banking on uninformed voters just hearing his name and not knowing any of the other candidates. What a sad strategy
Is this a campaign post?
Imagine the thievery if this schmuck were to win. Can‚Äôt teachers all opt out of dues except for a minimal collective bargaining fee?
When I first heard about him late last year I was annoyed that he didn't have a wiki page, that's a must-do if you're running for office- and he still doesn't have one!
I got another one today!

Has any teacher saved all of them?

I‚Äôd like to make confetti and celebrate someone to show them how much they mean to me by the amount of confetti I douse them with
I‚Äôm a teacher and NJEA member and I‚Äôm fully aware that my dues are funding this dude‚Äôs campaign against my will lol. I get constant emails and mailers from him. Our union prez wanted us to fill out a pledge card to say we are voting for him and I threw it out. He rubs me the wrong way and based on all of the comments here, I can see why
Thank you for posting this. I‚Äôve been getting non stop commercials from him. Between the sheer frequency and fear mongering I had a bad feeling about him.
I‚Äôve been getting his mailers since November. I was hoping after the 2024 election I‚Äôd get at least a few months respite for that stuff. But no, he keeps sending me shit. I looked him up after the first piece of mail and quickly decided he sucks. Thanks for the added information though.
He makes over 400k a year and the average teacher in NJ, who he is supposed to be representing, makes 60k.
Imagine if instead of spending all those teacher dues on ads, this guy just returned it to teachers in a lump sum payment, he‚Äôd be a shoe in
This doesnt sound legal at all
His association with the NJEA is actually the main reason I wouldn't support him. Which, ironically, is the only reason he's running.
It‚Äôs pretty disgusting
Suprise suprise, that's politics for you.¬†
I see his commercials and there is no effort at all. Talking about Book Bans. Yes that‚Äôs an issue. But this is a governor race. Book Bans is an issue in Jersey?
is this not campaign fund fraud?
Just like his campaign, this guy gives off major empty suit vibes.
Hm, interesting. New Jersey Monitor, part ot State Newsrooms, leans left while the New Jersey Globe is run by David Wildstein. There may be something to this.
He looks like a Jamaican Louis Litt
My old science teacher, fuck that guy.
Oh shit, that's wild af if true.
A corrupt self serving politician in New Jersey?!!! Say it isn't so Joe say it isn't so! üò±
I immediately hated him because his ads interrupt my British dramas, lol
Who is this guy anyway? I genuinely have no idea who he is compared to the other candidates. He has no name ID clearly.
I saw educators for Spiller everywhere and now that has to be a joke. Unless they‚Äôre not educated.
He speaks very well.  

I assume he would be able to pull off a win in the general. 

He's certainly not my first choice, but, he seems like a decent enough guy.
So much misinformation in this thread and it‚Äôs not even funny‚Ä¶


1. NJEA followed its democratic processes to screen and endorse Spiller for Governor. He had to jump through the same hoops as anyone else.


2. It is completely legal for unions to donate money to outside organizations that support its interests.


3. NJEA followed its democratic processes to decide how much money to donate to the group supporting Spiller. This was voted on by member representatives.


4. The outside group can not coordinate with the candidate or NJEA. This is why he does not have much in the way of direct staff for the campaign bc he can‚Äôt coordinate with the outside group.


5. NJEA members make voluntary donations to a PAC that supports endorsed candidates. The maximum donation by law is only $5,800, certainly not enough to pay for campaign staff.


6. NJEA is allowed to use member dues to communicate to members and hold events for members on topics that support their interests, such as endorsed candidates.


7. The $35,000,000 donated to the outside group is averaged over 200,000 union members. That is an average of $175 per member over two different budget years, so $87.50 of dues money for each year. The average educator has lost $45,000 out of their pocket due to reforms by Chris Christie and Steve Sweeney. The money donated is minuscule compared to that.


8. What is wrong with working class people (teachers, nurses, custodians, maintenance people, bus drivers, security guards, technology staff, instructional assistants, secretaries, case managers, therapists, guidance counselors) pooling their money together to support their interests? The real problem is a candidate can make a debate stage by having 100 wealthy friends and not a lot to support otherwise.


9. Spiller has over 8,000 signatures to get on the ballot, which is #2 in the race and more than establishment candidate Mikie Sherrill.
The guy with the shit hairline and AI-voiced ads is making a giant tax write off under the shell of a political campaign?

Shocked.
He‚Äôs ahead in most polls of everyone except Sherrill, so your argument is not accurate. Whether you like him or not, it‚Äôs pretty clear some voters do. 

Whether that means anything when votes are cast is impossible to say, but the idea that his is a ‚Äúghost‚Äù campaign is dumb. He‚Äôs very much running. 

I‚Äôm voting for Baraka, though.
New Jersey Globe story shared as evidence. Your argument is invalid.
Teachers union is only marginally better than police unions.
Dude looks like a cop. Was he ever a teacher?
Wow ... glad I've ignored the literally hundreds of mailers I've been getting about this guy.  Seemed sus and everything I hear about him is that he was a terrible mayor of Montclair and everyone hated working with him.  I'm new to the area so I know nothing about what he actually did while he was there.

Curious if teachers really support this guy.  But either way, I'm looking for someone serious to throw support behind.  I've heard good things about Josh Gottheimer.  But I also hear people who seem to strongly oppose him.  Not sure what to think.  Seems like the pull towards corruption is strong in NJ and the push to reduce accountability and reward cronyism is strong.  The amount of mayors I see who get caught, yet stil lretain support is shocking.  How do we keep these guys honest?
Say you‚Äôre a republican without saying you‚Äôre a republican. I‚Äôll make my own decisions, thanks though.
He‚Äôs a dick bag
Teachers love this guy.  They elected him their president and send him all their money to spend on this BS...a campaign he can't win.  I don't get it.  I expected more from the teachers union but here we are.
NJ voters deserve him.  A lot of voters in districts across the NJ voted for increased funding for their schools and thus more union dues for this guy's vanity project.  You get what you ask for.
Creepy weird dirtbag.
Yeah we even had someone come to our school to try to hype him up. They brought pizza
Yep, and it pisses me off every time. The latest edition of NJEA Today with him on the cover I threw right in the trash. I like that magazine for stories about colleagues and what they're doing in their classrooms. I don't want to read about him!!
Putting this here for visibility but everyone should watch.

>Do NJ teachers even realize their union dues are bankrolling this guy‚Äôs vanity project? Does anyone actually support this?

Check out his response here and tell me what you think.

https://youtu.be/q1EpSTjJeaA?t=1303
CONSTANT lol
I imagine the NJEA leadership would love having one of their own as governor. It's just sleazy though, and he's really just meh.
Yup. I can vouch for that!
He was very effective at doing favors for his friends and getting himself well liked by the New Jersey political fundraising machine. But other than that, yeah, the guy couldn't negotiate his way out of a paper bag.
That's the nicest way to put it. He may go to prison for the healthcare scheme.
To play devil's advocate... he was a mayor for one of NJ's wealthiest towns. How engaged does he have to be when there aren't that many structural, economic, etc issues in town.


If he was the mayor or Newark/JC/Paterson I would he more concerned...but Montclair stayed a well oiled machine¬†
Kinda like Spadea - I think it‚Äôs funny that they put up the worst possible options to make the others look so much better and somehow they will still get votes. It turns my stomach every time I see a commercial for Chitarelli.. like holy cow that‚Äôs the absolute best you can do? Based on the stats and plans the Democrats have the best of the overall plans so far.  Even Spiller‚Äôs not as bad as what the republicans have to offer this time though
One of a few reasons why I'm unsure on rank choice voting here/in the US, I'd rather somebody just get knocked out early on in a primary than limp somebody not terribly favorable to multiple stages. I just can't help but think of the case of NYC mayor with Adams and all that.
""weird, corrupt, unlikable middle"" - so basically, the epitome of Jersey
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day!
I would say no. They don‚Äôt.
How much of their dues go towards political campaigns?  This is typical anti-union BS‚Ä¶.. Your dues are bankrolling this guy. Your union is giving your money to him, obviously unions are bad.
[deleted]
It's such an interesting tactic since the joke always is that teachers don't need pizza parties, they need raises and supplies.
If your local is ineffective, before you leave the union altogether I would encourage you to go over your local's head (literally and figuratively) and talk to someone at the State level of the NJEA. 

When an incredibly corrupt BOE RIFed me in 2008 my local was fully in bed with them at the time and when I went to my local for some answers and relief they just shrugged their shoulders and pretty much said ""this happens sometimes... Good Luck!"" My BOE even fought my unemployment claim. In my final exit interview which I actually considered blowing off they put me in a room with State level NJEA officials and a lawyer. When I described my situation to them they actually started to laugh and said, ""Go home and be sure you're available to answer your phone in about three days. The person on the other end is going to apologize to you and say they made a clerical error. You will be reinstated but make sure you say the words 'I insist on being made whole on this'. If this doesn't happen here's my card"".

Everything they said would happen did almost to the letter and ""being made whole"" meant a slight pay increase along with full back pay for the summer as well as contributions WITH INTEREST into the 403b.

You're local may be weak and ineffective but the State level NJEA most certainly is not. I often say I would give them double my dues if they asked but I've also needed them. I used to be a guy that didn't so I understand the 'what do my dues pay for anyway' crowd as well.
This sounds frighteningly familiar.
But where‚Äôs the money and ego boosting in that like of thinking?
Its been a longstanding belief that money = outcome im elections, and the more mobey you raise and spend the more likely you are to win. Many have failed to understand thar the reason for that was that pre citizens united donations were more directly tied to actual voters. IE the dollar value raised was an indirect measure of enthusiasm and support, rather than the driver of the electoral outcome.

So at this point it seems hes trying to pull a Bloomberg and buy an election without really understanding that it wont work
>He should focus on supporting teachers

He denied the request of the local's president in Montclair to direct any PILOT revenue towards the schools. He also advocated against a capital investment in the schools - after years of underinvestment - despite years of teachers' complaints made during BOE meetings. 

He supports Sean Spiller.
The teachers union supports pro teacher candidates, of which Spiller is the most pro teacher union.
I‚Äôve gotten one a day for tha last two months. Right in the trash
Is this true??
Not true.
Goes to show how effective his 35 million slush fund is
Lucky. How have you not? I get mailers from him at least twice weekly. The only mailers for governor I get, it‚Äôs obnoxious and completely unnecessary.
I saw him at a town hall but up haven't received anything from him all the way up here in North jersey. The only thing I've seen is a Fulop commercial
Ras Baraka was a well-respected teacher and principal for years, so has reasonable positions on education. (See also, Miseducation of Lauryn Hill lol). Tbh I see him and Sherrill at the end.
So who are voting for in the Democratic primary? And what is Fulop's connection to the Kushners? I was leaning toward voting for him to be honest.
I believe they (the union employees) get COLA adjustments too
I would disagree and as a Montclair resident I have heard him speak a lot. He talks well without saying anything. True lead from behind type. Waits to see what way the wind is blowing and then pretends he was the one to lead there. Total empty suit.
>NJEA followed its democratic processes to screen and endorse Spiller for Governor. He had to jump through the same hoops as anyone else.

Spiller's the NJEA President, gunning for the NJEA endorsement. Nobody's going to believe that endorsement process was impartial and without pressure, implicit or otherwise. 

>NJEA members make voluntary donations to a PAC that supports endorsed candidates. The maximum donation by law is only $5,800, certainly not enough to pay for campaign staff.

This is the case with the NJEA's main PAC, NJEA PAC. 

However, his Super PAC is primarily funded by the one the NJEA doesn't like to admit exists, Garden State Forward. That one is funded out of the teachers' regular dues, and used however NJEA leadership wants. 

>What is wrong with working class people (teachers, nurses, custodians, maintenance people, bus drivers, security guards, technology staff, instructional assistants, secretaries, case managers, therapists, guidance counselors) pooling their money together to support their interests? The real problem is a candidate can make a debate stage by having 100 wealthy friends and not a lot to support otherwise.

Nothing wrong with pooling resources together. 

But first, it looks *really bad* to pool NJEA resources together for the *NJEA President* to run for office. It's hard to understate how bad that looks to regular people. It's much different than pooling resources together to support like, Andy Kim for Senate. 

But also, if the ""pooling"" is being done via Super PAC, instead of donating to the campaign of the candidate who's not even *trying* to fundraise on his own, then there are consequences. 

>Spiller has over 8,000 signatures to get on the ballot, which is #2 in the race and more than establishment candidate Mikie Sherrill.

I'll eat my hat if most of those signatures aren't NJEA members. 

I'm a public union employee too. Union puts a clipboard in front of you and says ""sign this to support the union president's run for office"", you'd be nuts not to sign it.
Sean?
Lmao he‚Äôs averaging like 7% in polls despite blanketing airwaves and mailboxes with his crap for MONTHS. 

How do you have virtually unlimited funds and yet fail to crack double digits in polling? With him failing to qualify for the debates due to a lack of tangible voter support, his ghost campaign is going nowhere but down.
The only polls that said he is doing well are internal polls in the Spiller camp that they won't release.
I don‚Äôt think the republicans are concerned about him
No, no. Most Democrats hate this fucking clown too.
The teachers union will support people who support teachers. Spiller is a former educator and would put education policy and educator conditions in the spotlight. After years of teachers being a scape goat in politics it would feel good to have someone in our corner at such a high position. That isn't a commentary on his general policies or scandals.
We got sandwiches. We were told there was free food, so we got surprised by someone trying to pitch us a campaign speech. Make it awkward to just take my sandwich and leave.
$35 mil buys some good goddamn pizza I hope
Was the pizza at least tasty, like Big Kahuna Burger tasty?
So his ‚Äúresponse‚Äù is just to ignore the question and say stuff he thinks we want to hear.
Every single newsletter from NJEA in 2025 I've gotten has had an ad for him in it, plus a few county level ones.
A union leader becoming governor isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm against at all. I think it would be great to have someone like that‚Ä¶ just not someone who thinks our money is for his personal gains.
I hate to say it but Spadea‚Äôs candidacy is something people should take seriously. NJ has elected plenty of republican governors in the not so distant past and there is clearly a voter base here for his MAGA bullshit
hardcore maga people love spadea. if you live near one of those people who has kept up trump propaganda on their property since 2016, you'll likely also find a ""i stand with spadea"" sign. ciattarelli is going to have to tack a lot harder to the right than he likely wants to in the primary to not have spadea siphon off all the votes, and i still think spadea can win trump's endorsement, which will carry weight with republican primary voters.
Chitarelli only lost by like 3 points to Murphy.  NJ has swung way more than 3pts according to the Presidential Election.  I think the Republican wins easily.
Though also incompetent. What makes Jersey work is that we are kinda like that‚Ä¶ but also most of us do good work.
Yup, agreed.
A tactic that doesn't seem to be working based on him not qualifying for the debate stage. So I think his attempts further prove that teachers need raises over pizza parties.
Seems to be the running joke for a lot of essential workers. Must be upper management 101
So pro teacher‚Äôs union that he‚Äôs managed to siphon off $30 million worth of dues. Will he pay that money back if/when he loses?
He‚Äôs the only candidate I‚Äôm getting mailers for, Including one prominently featuring Elmo‚Äôs Nazi salute. (I‚Äôll give him credit - Dems need to jump on that.) This is confusing given my town leans Republican and the white trumpers here aren‚Äôt going to vote for a Black dude from Montclair.

I also see him the most in my Insta feed, followed by Fulop. Sherrill is my rep, and I haven‚Äôt seen anything from her.
Yeah I'm voting for Ras Baraka
Fulop allowed the Kushners to overdevelop jersey city with more luxury high rises than needed. They take advantage of tax abatements, which are usually meant for low income areas, and use them to their advantage. In the process, they are obliterating affordable housing. 

Personally, I'm voting for Ras Baraka.
Hi u/ottorange let me be More specific. 

I'm 100% all in on the r/Stevenfulop campaign. (I even started the Reddit sub for it)

In a world where he doesn't get the nod, there are elements of all the remaining candidates that I could get on board with for a general election.

Sean is not my first choice, but if everyone is coalescing around him, he certainly speaks well about that. I'll get through a general and would probably be no different than Murphy has been, just sort of muddling along in the background. 

I really don't want to see what the state looks like under both a maga Federal government and a local maga chieftain, so I'm thinking more about electability than I have in the past.
Great points! Also, are we forgetting what happened back in 2017? Where they literally admitted to spending their own dues and members voiced concerns - NOT being ok with that? Back then they spent the largest amount on the 3rd District race to unseat Senate President Steve Sweeney. ELEC estimates that amount was $4.5 million‚Ä¶ NJEA president at the time said some was from membership dues. The members were under the impression that the money spent on the race was only from voluntary donations‚Ä¶ Seriously, NJEA is not looking out for their members, and only for their own political interests.
You‚Äôre pulling that average out of your ass. There‚Äôs very little polling available at all, and most of it is from PACs. So none of this is great data. But Spiller‚Äôs been in second place in at least 3 polls, and he‚Äôs been as high as 14% (with the leader Sherrill at 20%) in one of them. The only independent poll released was months ago and had him at 8% but it also had the leader Sherrill at 10% so that hardly makes any difference. 

Again, since I prefer Ras, I‚Äôd like Spiller to drop out so Baraka can capture those voters. But it‚Äôs silly to think they don‚Äôt exist just because you don‚Äôt like the candidate. I hate Steve Sweeney with the fire of a 1000 suns but he also has voters.
And Sherill is in the lead with 10%, only 3% points ahead. I dislike Spiller too but if there's anything Trump and Elon taught us is you can in fact buy an election.
That‚Äôs not true. Literally the only independent poll of this race had him in second, 2% by Sherrill. The Emerson poll.
I didn‚Äôt say I loved him, but the long winded rant and dogpile with superb links to the globe and monitor just seem to stink a little
i think as governor, spiller would throw teachers right under the bus if he had to.
No one I talked to in my school wants to vote for him.  They did not bring us any food‚Ä¶. We would have gladly eaten it and also not voted for him.
Unfortunately it was Pizza by Alfredo's
He does it later as well to another question about receiving benefits he wasn't entitled to. He just ignores the question which tells me that he knows the answer is worse than just deflecting.
Same! I can‚Äôt escape him.
Absolutely agreed! I've never gotten the sense that NJEA is super above board though, and this somewhat confirms that sense.
Thats not how elections work.
Republicans win the governor race all the time in NJ even when it is deep blue. Kentucky constantly has Democrat governors. Presidential and gubernatorial races are not connected
You say siphon off like he stole the funds, but it looks like according to the article, the funding came from one of the teacher's union PACs. I think it makes sense that the teachers union would want to put someone like Spiller in high office.
i've started getting a bunch of fulop mailers too, but i've been getting spiller's shit since early last fall.
I get a lot of Sherrill mailers. Roselle Park
I haven‚Äôt gotten a single mailer from anyone (now that i say this i will prolly get 20 tomorrow); Sherrill is also my rep. I do unfortunately have to deal with Ciattarelli‚Äòs insufferable ads whenever i watch stuff on sling
I know him personally and think he is a bad person. I will not vote for him under any circumstances. Fulop is probably my guy at this point though Baraka could be interesting.
What do you like about Spiller, specifically? Please answer.
I didn‚Äôt get shit either
Not even Alfredo‚Äôs Pizza Cafe? Ofc, no taste!
Okie dokie...we shall see but you are gonna have a MAGA governor however they work
Yep. I grew up in Kansas and we had democratic governors despite being a red state, and even today they have a democratic governor.
He‚Äôs the union‚Äôs president. Even if it‚Äôs not illegal, it‚Äôs a terrible look and is not going to help his campaign at the end of the day. When he loses, it‚Äôs just wasted money that hurts union members. If that‚Äôs what my dues were going toward, I would consider it theft.
But if he is the union president isn‚Äôt he deciding we‚Äôre the union pac‚Äôs money goes? This is clearly walking on the razor‚Äôs edge of illegal.
What did he do in person to you?
Oh no- I wasn‚Äôt defending him, he‚Äôs just better than the Republican options that are advocating for school choice, and against women‚Äôs rights. No love for this guy.
RemindMe! 8 months
Ah he is still the president. I thought since he was mayor of Montclair he moved on from the position.

Yes I am, I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that our worst is still better than their best and given this as our only choice which is unlikely I‚Äôd still vote for this over the alternative. I didn‚Äôt think I needed to spell it out so much but I guess I wasn‚Äôt being clear enough"
"I told everyone this 2 months ago thought I was nuts didn‚Äôt know what they were for, but I knew they were military!","I saw a line of them very close and very late early Dec before I heard about drones. Had a feeling they were military 

The mystery of the unexplained drone sightings over New Jersey and along the East Coast late last year has been solved, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said she was relaying the update directly from President Trump in the Oval Office.

In her first White House press briefing Tuesday, Leavitt said, ""After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.""

Part of the specification list of the new F 47 fighter ..

Autonomous Coordination: It will be capable of operating alongside drone swarms, coordinating their actions to overwhelm enemy defences.

It has been in the testing stage for five years was there a 47 in the sky when these drones were swarming around New Jersey and other areas probably not, but it definitely would warrant the testing of these swarms of drones! On their own",0.21,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jjfb0k/i_told_everyone_this_2_months_ago_thought_i_was/,23,1jjfb0k,2025-03-25 09:21,"Please go over to r/NJDrones
I told everyone I knew that it only makes sense that it‚Äôs a military test, otherwise they‚Äôd have been blown out of the sky. 

They also released it was military testing a while back, I think end of January?
The bigger issue is that you are actually believing what Karoline Leavitt says....on any topic.
https://i.imgur.com/d66w5Pk.png
They are trying to justify the cost of the F35 by claiming it will have this capability someday too. 

Heck even the SR71 had a 'spy drone' it would deploy. 

Drone R&D is a lot more established than some nebulous X program that might or might not result in a production run in another generation.
I did, but this affects us all even me I live in Pennsylvania and seen them the real drones not the blurry orbs that turned out to be stars and planets and airplanes cause people don‚Äôt know the difference you know the hysteria after they were first sighted
He didn‚Äôt say military he said approved FAA research and testing anything more would be releasing secrets. It‚Äôs just the way Trump handled this from the start. I‚Äôve been hyper focused on it and like I stated when they had the meeting about the release of the new jet plane a hyper focused on the drone support
He said this takes a lot of drones to support right I mean like a lot !
What the hell does that have to do with anything! Did I say other topics did I say I‚Äôm a Trump supporter or is it just because I called him the president why is everything political Jesus Christ?!! I am just stating his explanation and the way he worded it after he stated he was going to get to the bottom of it before he was in office.
I hate to break the news but a lot of people do not care and already assumed it was government related; other wise they would have shot out of the sky particularly near a military operation.

I live near Earle and things happen there that are rarely publicized.
>I live in Pennsylvania 



*of course*
Unfortunately, it has everything to do with everything. In case you haven't noticed, our country is imploding before our very eyes. And she is part of it, just lying and gaslighting about everything. Like Kayleigh McEnany did in the first term.

Yes, I know my reply had nothing to do with drones. But I am not going to let our country go down the tubes without a fight.

Yesterday Trump announced that Alina Habba would be the US Attorney for New Jersey. The same Alina Habba who said last year ""Donald Trump is the most ethical American I know"".

So try to make your point about drones without quoting anyone from this criminal administration.
Can confirm, don't give the tiniest shit about drones and so incredibly sick of seeing posts about them especially when there's a sub dedicated to them
I understand, but I have a personal connection with this from my sighting. It freaked me out and I‚Äôve been hyper focused on it. Never thinking they were alien like some people of course did because I saw them.
Sorry, but in case you haven‚Äôt noticed living in Pennsylvania is  much  higher prestige than New Jerseyü§£ just ask anyone from New York or Philadelphia
Because I‚Äôm sick and tired of our politics and I‚Äôm sick and tired about everybody crying or cheering you can‚Äôt do anything about it. All you‚Äôre doing is stressing yourself and hurting your own health. Let it go ! whatever is going to happen is going to happen so let‚Äôs just hope we all survive and like I always say we need more choices in this country like the rest of the civilized world. The two party system itself is why we are here at this point. The tennis game back-and-forth with the Democrats and Republicans for years does not work. It only just causes more separation between us and if more Americans thought that way, and thought of new ways to combat this problem instead of constantly fighting the other side and cheering for your side nothing is ever going to change or get better
And to give you an example, if you call every single person that voted for him a Nazi just because hate groups such as that support the Republican Party say to yourself this who else are they going to support the Democrats no but they would support a Nazi party then at least we will know our enemy Nobody wants their vote anyway.
Literally nobody cares?
Much more higher prestige you say!?!?
\>Let it go !¬†

Sorry, I can't let it go when our Government is sending people to a prison in a country not of their citizenship, with no due process. And don't worry about my health, I am capable of standing up for the rights of myself and others without hurting myself.
It‚Äôs more like literally you don‚Äôt care and that‚Äôs fine
The Pennsylvania drone bros are much more highly sought after for their much superior regional dingbat nonsense. It's all in the craftsmanship.
Yes, sorry I misspoke I didn‚Äôt come in here to argue geographical superiority that was just making an observation on something I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on OK if you‚Äôre just came in here to call me an idiot thank you very much. Move onto the next person to troll.

There was a wooden wall maze thing. Stepped on a board and there was a hidden nail. sticking up; punctured the bottom of my foot. Had to get taken to a hospital for a tetanus shot.
Yes, and my uncle worked there in the 80s.  The docuseries is not embellishing.
I only went once. Came damn close to drowning in the wave pool. I figured since I went to the shore every year I could handle the deep end of the wave pool no issue and jumped in. I immediately took a face full of water and while trying to cough it out took another and then another and another. I was done and blacking out when I managed to grab my cousin‚Äôs head and he pulled me to the ladder. As I am getting out of the pool coughing up all the water I took in I see the stoner life guard is just sitting there watching me. 

Later that day I rode the alpine slide and the break didn‚Äôt work for shit so I plowed into the guy ahead of me at the end as he was trying to get off the track. 

On the upside my cousin and I spent a while standing at the end of that speed slide with the bumps watching girls lose their tops. So it wasn‚Äôt an entirely death filled day.
Went a few times, never got hurt there. Probably because every time I tried the Alpine Slide I wound up stuck behind someone going slowly.
My 6 grade class trip was to Traction Park, 3 classes each went in different busses but coming back one bus was reserved just for all the injured
Like most people, I flipped over on the alpine slide and slide down the concrete track. Lots of the dreaded spray and some pretty good road rash. I went many times and thats my only horror story, unless you count the many bumps and bruises from the water slides.
Yep

Friends and I would go on the Colorado tiver and begin battling eachother raft to flip it over.

Raft 1 would launch and after the 1st turn would grab onto the sides to stop movement out of sight.  Then raft 2 would launch.  As you got out of the turn you begin to prepare for a full scale water siege by trying to board the other ship and flip it while simultaneously moving downriver. 

Fun fact. The bottom of the Colorado River is sharp AF with pointy rocks
Yes. I too went on a summer camp trip. The counselor went down this slide thing before me, I was with my friend. This is traumatic so here is your warning. He ended up degloving some fingers and having this huge gaping wound on his arm. They did not stop the ride, so my friend and I went on it immediately after him. We found him freaking out. I am a girl, I had on a bathing suit under my shirt. So I gave him my shirt and used it to try to staunch the bleeding while my friend ran to get help. I was just trying to keep him awake and stop the bleeding. This was in the 1980s, so no one had cell phones or anything. He came back to camp the last week with sooooo many stitches on his arm and hand. He wanted to thank me for helping him. It was so scary. I was about ten. The guy must have been about 17. ¬†Edit: I told my parents I lost my camp shirt. Somehow I got a new one, but did not tell them how I helped the guy. I was covered in his blood and just went into this water area, not a pool, and dunked myself to wash off. No soap, no one cared that there was a kid covered in blood on their hands either.
Yep and clearly I lived, no lie the 80‚Äôs man‚Ä¶ the best!!  Not without losing a lot of skin on that alpine slide deathtrap ride. Those were the days of my parents saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôll live‚Äù
Cannonball. Kamikaze slide. IYKYK.
Yes. I was 11 or 12 and was too scared to go an anything. Right choice.Both my cousins got hurt on the Tarzan Swing on the same visit.
Too young. But my mom went, and last Christmas, she made my grandma watch Class Action Park to show her the danger she put her through.
I still remember Action Park as the most fun place ever. Definitely remember coming home with some scrapes & bruises but nothing major. Loved that place in my early teens. 

Did get my flip flops stolen.
Yes. I didn‚Äôt even consider sliding down the Cannonball Loop because it freaked me out but I remember seeing it, and it was open and in operation. Enjoyed the wave pool, cliff diving, and other slides. No injuries. Had a lot of fun.
Every summer with sleepaway camp. They at least had some awareness and did not allow us to go in the wave pool or alpine slide.
My dad would take me and my 2 brothers every summer. One of us always came home with an injury.
Yes. I remember standing in line and having it stop for a while. Everyone would agree someone got hurt. A minute later EMTs come up and a while later a guy on a backboard is taken off the ride.  Cheers when it was our turn to ride.
Yeah I went to the dog and pony show too
Yup, and I‚Äôve seen broken bones, headwounds bad enough to give people a mask of blood, arms and legs turning into hamburger meat on the alpine slide and a giant nail through someone‚Äôs foot‚Ä¶ahhh, the memories!
Went in 1986/87 with some friends. Had to leave early cause one of my friends had a panic attack after one of the rides. Forget which one.
No :(

My dad was a cop.  I wanted to go so bad, but he knew all the horror stories and would never let his kids go
No, but I was there when the Tarzan swing was open.

Unbelievable how many people had the strength to hold on at the top but not the bottom of the swing (at it's apex). Their feet would drag the water, their fingers would lose grip, and WHAM!

Biggest faceplants I've seen to this day.
Weekly during summer camp. I have vivid memories of shooting tennis balls at the tanks and the alpine slide.
Yup.  There's nothing I can describe that the documentary on Max doesn't already go into.

My personal 2 biggest memories were:

\-When the round raft I was in (3 boys around 7-11 years old in a very large raft made for teens/adults) went too slow down the rapids and a raft full of older kids hit us, our raft went vertical up the side of a wall, one of us fell into the other raft, so the older kids just tossed him into the water...then I fell in the water and went through the rest of the rapids like that.

\-Going down the cart track where you press the brake down to release it, I was too small/scared to make it go fast but I saw other kids zooming on the other tracks and one of their carts rolled over (they were fine but scratched up)

Also, I honestly don't remember seeing our parents for a good 5 hours that day.  I think they may have dropped us off and gone somewhere else?  This was probably around 1993-1995 timeframe.
Ohh yeah...  I nearly died on the Tarzan swing.  

I'm gonna guess I was 13.  Had an otherwise fine day there.  Then I decided to give the swing a go.  There was no instruction or anything, so I didn't know how to hold it or take up the tension.  Instead I just lept off and because of slack in the line, simply plummeted straight down as the swing was ripped from my hands.

I also didn't know the pool was spring-fed and a brisk 50F.  My body seized, my mind went blank and I didn't know where I was.  Luckily I was a very strong swimmer and by 13 had been SCUBA diving for 2 years.  I simply held my breath until the world righted itself, I could see bubbles moving in one direction and headed that way... to the surface.

I never tried that swing again, but the only injury suffered that day was to my pride and a killer sunburn.
Swim team went at the end of the season. It was a blast, and none of us were at risk of drowning. I did scrape the heck out of my arm on the alpine slide, but a good time was had by all regardless.
I like most people got injured on the alpine slide.

My buddy almost drowned in the cliff dive cause he landed balls first , got the wind knocked out of him and the lifeguard didnt fucking notice to the point the lifeguard up top jumped down to save him even though there was one in the little tower at the bottom level .
I went there one time in the early 90's and did not have a good time. Back then most people walked around Action Park barefoot and smoking was allowed in park.  I stepped on three still burning cigarette butts that day, a fat lady stepped on my toe and I lost my wallet on one of those tube rides (my fault).  The wallet was returned a week or two later with no money in it. There was only $13 in there.
Yes. Fuck that overrated shit hole.
Yes, I went when it was Action Park and Mountain Creek. Bled every time.
The ? Is who didn‚Äôt go to action park? Of course I did :))
I survived.  It was a really hot day.  I had to use a good portion of my money for water shoes so I didn't burn my feet.   

I got into a raft with a friend of mine who was double my size down one of the water rides.  We hit a turn and almost flipped the raft.  He was above me for several seconds.
HECK YA! Jersey grown gal!
yeah we went on the regular in highschool\early college.

Rule was you took 2 cars, because someone was likely getting hurt and no reason to spoil the day for everyone.

Its one of the rare times when you hear stories, think they sound exaggerated, but if anything, it was actually crazier than they seem.

Everyone there was drunk, the staff was stoned out of their mind, and everything about the place, rides, layout, etc, were like you let a 12 year old design stuff.
Only went once, despite living 15 minutes away. (This was during the Mountain Creek days)

No horror stories other than lines being too long, the wave pool being jam packed with people, the water being too cold, and the incline taking its toll walking from ride to ride.

Camel Beach was way better
And lived to tell about it!
I grew up 15 minutes away and was a teenager in the mid 90s which was when it was in its peak state of disrepair and neglect while still being a popular attraction.

There is so much BS about dangerous rides.

There was nothing dangerous about the attractions. The issue was teen staff that didn't care and a rowdy crowd many of whom had limited swimming ability.

The alpine slide everyone talks about being a death trap? It can still be found in many alpine towns in Europe. It's considered a family ride. People are so full of shit, you have to deliberately push down to go; as soon as you stop deliberately pushing the lever down it brakes. But kids would ride the thing like hooligans deliberately trying to crash.

The majority of the accidents were swimming relating. There was too much alcohol going around combined with a crowd that had a lot of weak swimmers.

That said the disrepair of the rides did cause minor issues that could make it feel like the wild west.

I remember one of the smaller slides that went into the structure where the cliff jump was. The fiberglass was extremely worn in many spots. I came to a complete stop long before the end of the slide. At the same time the operator sent the next person down before checking to make sure I had come out. I managed to scoot my way out just in time to not get hit. But even if I had worst case would have been a minor bruise.
Nope. Hence why I‚Äôm still alive.
I went there on my 8th grade class trip.  It was a long way away from Little Falls.  Not one person came back from that trip unharmed.  I think I even remember a girl that broke her arm.  I remember a COLLOSAL multi person pile-up on the CONCRETE Alpine Bobsled ""ride"".  We got so effed up & hurt.  Great times...NOT.

Edit:  Later that same day someone got folded in half & stuck in the loop de loop water slide.  I forgot what they called it.  I'm pretty sure they did not save that person.  That should be in the news somewhere on Google.
It‚Äôs best you went to the hospital, instead of getting sprayed at their on site infirmary. That must have been a wild time to be alive.
Same story except i was on the ""fast track""  brake didnt work right was like stuck - and finally i was coming up to fast on someone and pulled it back as hard as a could and i guess it got past a part it was getting stuck on cuase there was like a POP and it went all the way back and flipped the cart and i skidded down the concrete in my bathing suit.

THe flesh from the friction burn was seared and still smoking by the time i stopped and this nasty liquidy fat goo just handing off my legs. 

Fun stuff.....that wasnt even the bad part....the antiseptic spray was 10x worse then the injuries
I think your memory is faulty regarding the alpine slide. I believe its next to impossible for the brake to be broken.

For the sled to go you have to push down on the handle. It brakes as soon as you let up.

The alpine slide had a reputation for accidents because people deliberately tried to crash or get to fly off.
My last ride on the Alpine Slide was ruined by a slow poke
That damn spray was worse then the friction burn
The alpine slide is only a death trap if you ride it like an asshole. The sled only goes when you actively push down the lever otherwise the brake is on at all times.

I last rode one of them in the German alps. It was a family ride there.
You went on the Cannonball Loop?! Holy crap
I don't believe the loop water slide ever opened to the public. It only ever tested.
Hah, remember a friend who hit the water funny on the rope swing. Went to the first aid station because he thought he dislocated his arm. They sent him away telling him to ""Take a whirpool, that will help""

To this day we are unsure if they meant go hang out in one of the rides that was like a whirlpool, or if they just assumed this 19 year old had ready access to a whirpool at home.

Anyway, it became a running joke whenever someone hurt themselves in some way, no matter how minor or serious. ""ehh, just take a whirpool, you will be fine""
My recollection of the brake was it was a straight bar on a pivot point. Push down on the handle and it raised the pad attached to the other side under the cart. Pull up and it pushed the pad down against the track. To your point yes, if you just let go, the weight of the brake pad would drop the pad against the track since you had to actively hold the pad up by pushing down. However, in this case, even pulling up to force the pad down didn‚Äôt help. It didn‚Äôt matter how hard I pulled up the handle barely moved and the cart barely slowed. I don‚Äôt know if something was jammed blocking the pad from being pushed down or if the pad was just worn out. All I knew is I could only go fast or really fucking fast and at the end I couldn‚Äôt slow enough to avoid hitting the guy ahead of me as he was trying to get off the track. 

I rode it multiple times that day and it was only one time the brake didn‚Äôt work. I assumed it was a broken cart.
I was a young teenager at Action Park in the 80‚Äôs while I don‚Äôt remember I‚Äôm going on a limb here and say I was acting like an asshole. But let‚Äôs be frank it was sort of very easy to get hurt on
Nahhh.  No one ever rode the loop.  Cannonball was a tube slide that came out of the side of the hill an dumped you into a freezing cold pool.  You can still see it from the gondola just to the right during mountain bike/ snow season.
It was opened to the public for a short time. Read the second paragraph [here](https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a33796608/class-action-park-human-test-dummy/). And I found that after a few seconds of searching.
Bill memory is likely hazy. Even if he was correct they might have opened it a few times your story about someone having an accident while you were visiting is almost certainly bullshit.

And I can 100 percent say your assertion the person didn‚Äôt make it is not true. The actual action park deaths are well documented."

Just as other people have commented, try to stay hydrated. I know it can be difficult, especially if you‚Äôre vomiting a lot and your stomach can‚Äôt hold anything in, but you definitely need an intake of fluids to help your body recover. Dehydration is no joke.

Stay hydrated as best you can and make sure you eat! You may have no appetite or may feel nauseous but you have to eat in order to fight it and feel better. Look up BRAT foods. Once you start to eat you will start to feel start to feel better almost instantly, even if it‚Äôs only a few bites. Just eat what you can and eventually your appetite will come back.

Good luck and feel better!

Me and my wife had it a few months ago after our son had it. Hydration is key, Pedialyte and Gatorade worked for us but she still ended up having to get IV fluids once she stopped throwing up because she couldn't keep anything down.

Try not to make any sudden moves, I jumped up to help her and immediately got light headed, and then thew up. We both found that laying on our left side provides some relief, not exactly sure why. I was good as long as I didnt move lol. Good luck, it passes fast.
Haven't caught it in 25+ years, but last week broke the streak.
Here in New jersey, yes. My son was taken to the ER last Tuesday and kept for 24 hours in the emergency room without a room and completely contagious. They filled him up with IV fluids because he was so dehydrated and refused to drink anything. Not knowing he was still contagious and sensitive  he was home that weekend and on Saturday ate too much sugar and fat while his belly was still sensitive .Cleaned up my son's mess in the bathroom sink and toilet on Saturday night and lunch time on Monday I started getting symptoms . No vomiting, only diarrhea, sips of pedialyte, ginger ale , hot tea have been helpful to avoid dehydration, the scariest part of norovirus . I wouldn't take anything, no medication , unless it was the one prescribed by doctors . One day and 8 hours later I still have the headache, mild fever on and off , and complete body aches.‚Äã the one time I got nauseous was this morning and I had heard on the internet how if you sniff rubbing alcohol it will calm the nausea and guess what, it worked ! Do not rush back into Foods is what I have learned from my son . So far the food I have eaten included toast with a little bit of butter, the next morning toast with a little bit of peanut butter for protein and fats, wonton soup with most of broth and chicken and rice soup, mostly broth.
Thank you!
Ugh hopefully you‚Äôre in the clear! It‚Äôs awful right now üòÇ

What‚Äôs your most underrated small business or restaurant in NJ that more people need to try?,We just had an amazing one close down a few towns over that had the best cheesesteaks! Love me some local gems‚Ä¶,0.96,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jj8nhf/whats_your_most_underrated_small_business_or/,350,1jj8nhf,2025-03-25 02:03,"Simple Bare Necessities in Sparta. It‚Äôs a refill shop for things like detergent, soaps, deodorant and then pantry items like local pasta, grains, legumes, dried fruit , candy, spices, oil etc along with a new art supply section that is pay as you wish.

Bring your own jars to fill.
Jersey Gyro  - Lodi

Located in a small plaza with a 7-11, Smoke shop, and ShopRite Liquors. 

Seriously, the best Greek food in the area. Mike, the owner, is a nice guy and humbly appreciates every customer coming in to get food.

My Wife is Greek and said this is the closest you‚Äôll get to authentic Greek food in Greece.
Windmill, the original one in West End, Long Branch.
If you like Mediterranean food, the best we‚Äôve had is in Bloomfield.. Manouche & Co. they have a family meal for 4 people that truly feeds 6.
This thread is beautiful
If you‚Äôre not Indian and want Indian food, go to Oak Tree Road in Islen for the best Indian food in the country.
Steve‚Äôs Burgers on 46 in Garfield. Incredible
For my family it's Jamians in Red Bank. We first went about a year ago and we've gone back half dozen times since. Everything we have ever ordered has been jaw dropping.  Nothing elegant, great bar w restaurant and some live music at night. Very friendly, my 7 and 10 year old love the food.
Four brothers breakfast in Warren. Best fried chicken anywhere.
Lady & The Shallot - Trenton Farmers Market, best vegan and gluten free food around.
[From Scratch](https://www.fromscratchridgewood.com) in Ridgewood. Small BYOB place, run by a husband/wife/son combo who moved from Rome about 15 years ago.

*AMAZING* Northern Italian cuisine, great hospitality. They offer periodic cooking classes too!
Wait, OP, how do you start this whole thread and not post the place you went???

My ‚Äúhidden gem‚Äù is Sophie‚Äôs Bistro in Somerset, right on the border of New Brunswick. Homey French bistro with excellent food and service.
I love this post and thank you for it! 

Full disclosure, I own a NJ craft brewery, and I'm on the board of our state's Brewers Guild but... 

PLEASE support the small business bars, stores and restaurants that offer NJ made alcohol.  Nefarious interests have made it difficult to operate in this state, and NJ has one of the worst market shares of craft beer/alcohol of any state in the entire country.   If the bar's lineup doesn't have any NJ there may be some shitty reasons behind it.  

We're working on a program to recognize the retailers and bars that do it right.  We're also working on a new law that would actually give monetary incentives to the places that support NJ-Made alcohol.
Nemo in keyport. Sushi is delicious. Quality is outstanding. I go there so often, for christmas 2 years ago they gave me a beautiful tea set. They're dedicated to their craft. They've become my comparison to any sushi I eat. "" it's not Nemo but it's good ""
Sabor Latino, Netcong. Even the kids love it.  We always end up talking to other patrons. Very friendly place. Great food.
Espo's or Vinnie's in Raritan.
Honestly for Viet food. Pho99 in Eatontown has got to have the best Bun Bo Hue around
Taco Stop- South Amboy

Binh Duong - Bloomfield 

El Aguila Dorada - Bayonne
When I die, I want one last Italian sub from DA Subs in Matawan. It's cash only, but truly magical subs are made there.
Mama‚Äôs up in Hackettstown. Great Italian food and they accommodate so many allergy  or special diet needs.
Enzo's Pizza in Jackson. Best cheese steak I've ever had and their special is to die for! Prices are on point, service always good. We try to eat there at least once a month!
Franco‚Äôs Pizza in Edison. Great plain slice and staff are great people. 


Ara‚Äôs Hot Chicken in Highland Park. Not my all time favorite chicken place but the owner and staff are always such nice people so when I‚Äôm in the area I try and stop by. That‚Äôs not to say the food can‚Äôt hold its own though, it‚Äôs very good.
Mancini‚Äôs Pizza on Rt. 18 in East Brunswick‚Äîthe sauce is exactly what I grew up with and loved in Brooklyn. Great family restaurant, excellent food, probably doesn‚Äôt get the recognition of some of the bigger places but it‚Äôs fantastic.
Black River Roasters, Whitehouse Station. Excellent coffee. The second floor is a welcoming homey space to enjoy it in.
For the river towns: Acasia Thai in Phillipsburg. Reigelsville Inn in Reigelsville. Honey Moon Bakery in Frenchtown. El Tule in Lambertville.
City Workship and City W in Maplewood are heritage/work wear stores nicely set up and with beautiful well-chosen things.  If you need new clothes and want fewer better things check them out.  And the nice thing about it is you can try the clothes on and not have to deal with guessing about size and returns.
Brownie Points in Summit

Swiss Pastry Shoppe in Scotch Plains
Falafel Station in Jersey City: the pine nut and harissa stuffed falafel is so great

Sweet Vinyl in Denville: The best coffee in the area and a wonderfully curated vinyl selection

Pandan Room in Hackettstown: Been a family favorite for almost 20 years. Amazing, fresh Indonesian and Thai Food

Mesob in Montclair: Great Ethiopian food

The Claridge Theater in Montclair: A great nonprofit movie theater that shows blockbusters, but also gets indie, foreign and documentary films to show you literally can't see anywhere else in NJ.

Shan Shan Noodles in Parsippany: Just generally delicious hand-pulled noodles
Spicy Garden in Manasquan.  Overall very good Thai food but holy smokes their ‚Äòheaven chicken‚Äô is the best general tso‚Äôs I‚Äôve had ever, anywhere, hands down.  It‚Äôs sticky deliciousness using good chicken without a ton of breading.  Plus the owner is a genuine ray of sunshine.  Takeout only.
Veggie Heaven in Somerset. I believe they have one in Montclair as well.
The Baklava Lady in Englishtown üßÅü•ÆüéÇ
Heard a rumor that Salt Gastropub in Byram is reopening this year! IYKYK.
One of the Best bakeries on planet earth is Zadies in Fair Lawn.

They are closed for a little while to fix up from a fire but you can still find their products in some stores.
Wish Upon a Jar in Point Pleasant. Probably the best humans to own a business in this MAGA-ass town.
Osteria Italiana - Garfield
Sharky‚Äôs - Clifton
El Azteca Mexican Restaurant - Park Ridge- Bergen County.  Family owned and absolutely delicious

Latino Flavor Grill in Manahawkin. In  a strip mall off of Rt 9. Some really great dishes. The Shrimp Trefongo and the octopus ceviche are awesome
if youre a guitar player theres a spot in hackettstown called Finely Tuned Music. i heard about him from a musician friend and took a guitar to him for a set up and some electronic work. it was great and ive had him do my 7 others in the last few weeks plus bought a USA tele from him for a steal . dude's name is frank.
Heirloom Kitchen in Old Bridge.
La Chocolate Box - Lambertville. It is a local chocolate shop, and everything is amazing. I love their peanut butter cup and caramel bonbons. 

Taskin Bakery - Paterson. Turkish bakery with sweet and savory food. The baklava is amazing and they are open 24 hours.
I hate to give up my favorite spots at the risk of not getting a seat when I go, but I‚Äôd rather see them do well than have to not wait for a seat so I guessss I‚Äôll share. My 2 favorite Mexican places are La Tentacion in westville, and La ingrata in Camden. The food is amazing at both places.
Asian Fusion in Toms River
Boaggio‚Äôs Bread Mt. Laurel. Awesome homemade Italian food, hoagies, cannolis, bread, pastries. Just good food.
For a diner Fast Break in Tom's River is an absolute treasure. Very small but it's a time capsule when you walk in. Entirely family run by a mom and her daughters. The food and prices are phenomenal! I always leave with leftovers because the portions are so huge. 

I grew up going to Americana in eatontown and Redbank Diner (RIP) and fast break is better than both, and those are both amazing (seriously so sad redback diner is gone)

And for coffee

Due Back in Island Heights is amazing with specialty lattes and drinks that change every month. Very tiny family owned and they just had a baby. So I'd rather support them than corporate places like Bucks or Dunkin 

And it's so nice to walk around island heights after you get your drink. You feel like your walking around in a Gilmore Girls episode

Cool Beans in Toms River ‚Äî Great coffee bar and lunch spot
Jersey Kebab in westmont NJ. The best k√∂fte I've ever had. Owners are really kind, always generous. They even feed the needy/homeless. Then fucking trump's ICE got them... While they were waiting for their application with the government to go through, you know, so they could be here legally. Jesus fucking christ.

Support your local immigrants. They need you.
Al-Basha in Paterson! Amazing Palestinian food.
If you‚Äôre from New Jersey, or just Italian and angry, do I have the place for you. New Jersey‚Äôs hottest club is, your mother and I are separating. This place has everything. Chutes, ladders, a doorman who only high fives children of divorce. MTV‚Äôs Dan Cortez.
Try Papa Pancho in Edison, NJ. Indian pizza place. They used to be better before they knocked down the wall and combined with the place next door.

Tandoori Paneer Makhani pizza - tandoori paneer (cubes of cheese), red onions, jalapeno, cilantro, tandoori makhani sauce.

Shaam Savera Pizza - paneer bhurji (same cheese as above, but kind of cut and scrambled weith spices), spinach, red onions, green pepper, jalapeno, masala sauce.

Pav Bhaji Pizza - It's a street food of spicy mashed vegetables in butter

I like the chili garlic bread and the spicy potato pizza.

They have other food on the menu because they combined with Moghul Express.. same company that owns a bunch of restaurants.
Bombaywala in Paramus. Every time I go it's pretty empty but everything I've had there has been phenomenal.

Emilio‚Äôs in Atlantic Highlands.  The food is amazing, the owner and his family are incredible.
Birnn Chocolates in Highland Park! Everyone working there is wonderful and the chocolates are top notch
Cafe Mobay and Agora, both on Broad Street in Bloomfield.
Not a restaurant but for those of you that like metaphysical stores A Moment of Zen in Salem is by far my favorite. The owner is super chill and the crystals are very affordable. Some of them are only $1. She also sells pendulums, jewelry, oils, candles and tarot decks.
Carella's Shoes
2431 Nottingham Way
Mercerville, NJ 08619

https://maps.app.goo.gl/jbVdLLj1krNNxgKbA

Especially if you have children with special needs or you have a hard time getting shoes that fit. 
Guy met us at the door and was incredibly kind and undertaking with my daughter.  He brought out several pairs, and it was the best experience we've ever had. It took the stress out of shoes buying. The new shoes have been a huge success with no issues after 7 days. 
Don't get me wrong - they were definitely more expensive, but WORTH IT! 
Please tell everyone you know to shop there. There is also a shop that this family owns next door. 
10/10 - I will be taking my kids there from now on.
Adeline deli in rahway across from the train stayion

I will argue they have the best birria tacos in union county. They also have awesome papusas, and a seasonal squash blossom taco or quesadilla that is phenomenal. 

It's a hole in the wall with a grandma always over a huge pot that she could sleep in. 

10/10
Everyone here needs to do themselves a favor and go to Flemington BBQ

It's so damn good and you get an insane amount of food there
Pancho‚Äôs in Atlantic City ‚Äî some of the best authentic Mexican food in the state.

It‚Äôs a small hole in the wall place right next to White House Subs, so tons of people walk right past it without ever noticing it or popping in.
Damicos in Somerdale
Marge‚Äôs Diner on Route 9 in Cape May Court House has some amazing breakfast
For musicians and music people: 



Ritchies Music in Rockaway.  I bought my first amp there (although they were at a different location) in 1982 and I still buy and and all guitar/music gear from them.

  
Hidden Tracks record store in Boonton.  Great selection, reasonably priced and a great, friendly owner who also books shows there.

  
Station 1 in Pompton Lakes.  Record store but also tons of videos, books, games, and general entertainment related obscurities.  Amazing place, located in an old train station.
Erie Bakery in Rutherford. Black Magic Bakehouse in Ridgewood. Ayala Coffee in Union. Pigeon Peas in Bloomfield (Caribbean vegan food).
Even though this is probably someone mining content for a click-baity article, I'll still bite. I can't believe that Drew's Bayshore Bistro in Keyport isn't better known than it is.
Saltwater Social in Highlands. Just opened up last summer and every meal I've had so far has been a hit.

Second Jetty in Sea Bright has the best seafood I've ever had. Just out of this world every single time.
There is an Indonesian store and eatery, primarily takeout in Metuchen called Dita's market
Rook coffee. They have a couple of stores and may only be in Monmouth but man their new Orleans blend cold brew is delicious.
Pie girl in Hightstown, absolutely incredible pies, cakes, focaccia and all kinds of baked goods!
Beach Bee Meadery in Long Branch, not your typical craft beverages
Kate & Al‚Äôs Pizza, Columbus Market
The daily bean in Vernon. Sushi Ya 2 in Vernon. The sizzle is an Argentine restaurant in Newton. Edison TexMex Deli sooo good. Uruguayan pastries Rombiolo Bakery Cafe!
Portside- Port Monmouth... A true local pub. Affordable drinks, and food is amazing
Any of the Millburn Deli‚Äôs, but obviously the original one at 379 Millburn Avenue is a pilgrimage in itself. Source: former employee and current customer.
Vinyl Dinosaur bayville it's basically a flea market for nerds
For my south jerseyans, Momma Rosa in lindenwold. Best italian food ever. Small restaurant, cash only, beautiful ambience. Owner is so kind and everything is made by him. Eating there feels like Italian neighbors inviting you for dinner. I will praise that spot until i die
not close to cheesesteaks but peck peck chicken in teaneck has amazing fried chicken

Mandy‚Äôs Subs on the way into Stone Harbor. Right on Stone Harbor Blvd tucked into a gas station. Best in the county, in my humble opinion. Matter of fact, I might get an Italian today now that I‚Äôm talking about it.
Fresh Bistro in Highlands. It‚Äôs a bit pricy, but legitimately some of the best Italian food I‚Äôve had in my life
Hans Chicken at Little Ferry
Freppe‚Äôs in Plainfield is so good
Charlie‚Äôs Place in Waldwick. Same owner and chef as Allendale Social and Boschetto in Montclair. It‚Äôs gastropub style but man does he create some really unique and amazing dishes. Of course has your standard burger, steak but also amazing bao buns, spicy vodka rigatoni, wagyu beef, etc. The ambiance and cocktails are killer plus tons of TVs. Kind of offers everything.
Pueblo Magico in Middletown

Chicken Kebab in Glen Rock! Such good Mediterranean food, and their coconut cake is one of the best things I‚Äôve ever eaten ‚ú®
Mcafee Hardware in McAfee.  Way more stuff in the store than you‚Äôd think by seeing it from the outside and incredibly helpful and friendly workers  Tell them what you‚Äôre looking for and they don‚Äôt just tell you what aisle, they walk you there and make sure you find what you need - or make recommendations if you‚Äôre not sure.
Tikka Masala Indian Fusion in North Brunswick. Tiny restaurant but the food is bomb, and the owner is so sweet.
Bengal Spice in Woodland Park is pretty good. I like when a restaurant is consistent in quality with their dishes so I highly recommend it if you want to order and order again. They also have a lunch buffet special (idk if it‚Äôs still there tbh) but it was for 14 bucks for a certain time window.
Sabor De Mi Tierra in Verona has some of the best Colombian food I‚Äôve ever had. Food is fantastic and the portions are large.
Missy's main Street cafe in Rockaway, the place has the best breakfast/lunch around and has such a a great atmosphere.
Pizzaiolo in Midland Park. Great pizza, pastas and salads. BYOB, not fancy but also not a dive bar. Great for families.

Bistro 46 in Morristown, great variety, a bit of a Mediterranean/Italian mix, BYOB but a huge menu and rarely has a long wait 

Kazu Kitchen in Denville, 10/10 ramen bowls and can pretty much alter any dish if you ask, plus pretty inexpensive for the portions, i go there for their Karachi Chicken
Union Pork Store in Union. Best natural sausages and bacon. ü•ì
Double-Zero pizza in Fairfield. Cash only! Forget everything on the menu except the pizza. Plain is fine but pepperoni is great!

Yianni's Greek Taverna, Mantoloking Rd, Brick.
Sabor Unido in Newark
La Sorrentina ! In Bergenline ave , good Italian food and pizzas ! Good attention and kind persons! üôå
Sorrento Bakery in East Hanover! The best Italian bakery in the Garden State!
Cafe 57 in Washington (Warren County) and Kuay Tiew 9 in Clinton.
Pizza 
Joey Ds Metuchen - Buffalo Chicken Pan Pie ü§åü§å
Tony's Tano Mall Edison - Best Sicilian slice I've ever had

Wings
Finnagles in Clinton.....Finnagles sauce is something special...you can get it on anything not just the wings 

Tacos
Casa de Los Tacos - Seacacus 


Auto Repair
B&L Tire Edison....They do great work and are reasonably priced, a hard to find combo
Mr. E‚Äôs Game World. Great selection and the owner is so nice
Bagelati in cinnaminson, or mart pretzel. Gotta love it
Cafe Amici in Somerset!! Best pie of pizza AND best buffalo wings in north and central Jersey in our opinion!
Glassworks in Morristown. Take two hours, learn how to cut small glass pieces, arrange them on a larger piece of glass, and a week later you‚Äôll receive a kiln-fired, one-of-a-kind glass creation. It‚Äôs easy enough for kids to do (they have precut glass and project templates) but also gives freedom for the more creative people in your group. Very relaxed space for socializing, too!
I have used this rental company, Cocktail Caravan, for all my family parties. They have mobile bars,  furniture,  tents, lighting. They can do a whole party with just one company. The bartenders are awesome. www.cocktailcaravanbar.com
Segovia in Moonachie, I'd argue the best Spanish food in Nj. Always consistent.
KB's BBQ in Irvington
CMC Deli Store - Bergenfield NJ the chopped cheese and the CMC Sauce is amazing
panchos, in atlantic city. lowkey can be a bit tricky if you dont speak spanish but the food is superb. not too many like it around
Jerry's Gourmet and More in Englewood. Best Italian market I've found. Lots of homemade stuff, great prices, etc. Moved out of state a few years ago, but I still try to stop in whenever I'm back home.
Magic Grill in Garwood - Its a Mongolian BBQ Spot - my parents have taken me there since I was in a car seat and we still go often 28 years later.
I don‚Äôt think they are underrated, but you can drive by both of these places and not even realize‚Ä¶ Taqueria El Azteca in Wildwood and Tacos By The Shore in Rio Grande. Azteca is my number one, but both have great food. Really nice owners and employees at both spots.
Laurie‚Äôs Chocolates Berdan Ave Wayne
Idk if this would count since they have multiple locations. But i really love Super Chix in East Hanover on route 10. It‚Äôs a Texas style chicken place. The Fried chicken sandwich is delicious. The only complaint i have is that it‚Äôs a little bit more pricey than the usual fast food restaurant and the portion sizes are Immense. I usually can‚Äôt finish all my food in one sitting. If you want something more recreational, i would say recess bar in parsippany. Essentially it‚Äôs a bar that is meant to attract people who maybe a little more ‚Äúanti social‚Äù. They have in-home gaming consoles and they only serve alcohol, not food.
Haisch Bakery in South Plainfield. Incredible donuts and pastries.
El Aguila Dorada in Bayonne is some of the best mexican food i‚Äôve ever had. Mordi‚Äôs Sandwich Shop in Jersey City has chicken schnitzel that I would genuinely consider for a last meal with their garlic lemon aioli. Panini Bistro in Matawan also has great sandwiches, obviously. Patsy‚Äôs Bistro in Fair View has been a staple in my family for 40 years, some of the best red sauce you‚Äôll ever have in your life, bonus points if you can handle spice- get their medium or hot sauce. you won‚Äôt regret it.
European Provisions on the border of East Brunswick and South River. Amazing sandwiches and polish food.
Norah‚Äôs Irie on Springdale Ave in Long Branch. Delicious Jamaican food tucked back in a neighborhood so it‚Äôs easy to drive right by and miss it. 




Ra√≠zes de Portugal Cafe & BBQ in West End Long Branch on Brighton Ave. Amazing food and they have screaming deals on the Too Good To Go app, too, if you get lucky. 




Papa Ganache is a Vegan and Gluten Free bakery in Matawan, Manasquan and Crawford. They also sell meals, cakes and catering for all kinds of holidays. One half of the bakery is vegan. The other half is vegan and gluten free. They have cooking classes, too. Everything is absolutely amazing and you‚Äôd never know that it‚Äôs vegan and gluten free. My favorites are their vegan and gluten free cupcakes and muffins.
La Serra Gardens in Totowa, breathtaking grounds with sculptures, plants, incredible gifts and home decor but the BEST part is the cafe. The owners are Italian and sell home made baked goods in addition to really dope specialty coffee. It should be a destination it‚Äôs honestly so gorgeous with so much to look at.
Bobby Caboose deli in Fairfield some of the best meatballs around
Caetano‚Äôs in Kenilworth.  Every meal is perfection. Mike‚Äôs Place Deli during the day, and at night it changes to a restaurant.  Complete hidden gem.
The Birria Kitchen in Edison, NJ. It‚Äôs a phenomenal little spot and they have mainly Birria style foods, (tacos, nachos, tortas, loaded fries, burritos, quesadillas and a lot more). It used to be picked and the business slightly slowed down, but it‚Äôs still amazing and worth every penny ü•≤ it‚Äôs really some of the best tasting Birria I‚Äôve ever had.
Coffee break in Hackensack. Tiny spot. They have some breakfast and lunch specials. It feels like an actual cafe in Italy. Everything is such good quality and delicious
Boonton Coffee Shop in Boonton

A2B South Indian restaurant in Parsippany, south Plainfield
Cedar Beans on Pompton Ave in Cedar Grove.  Cute and comfortable coffee shop.  You can get just about anything food and drink wise, that you could have gotten at Starbucks.  

Zest on Fairfield Road in Fairfield.  Mostly vegan but they have chicken and egg options.  Breakfast and lunch, all house made.  And a great selection of desserts ‚Ä¶ the sweet potato brownie is addictive.
If you're into white people tacos I highly recommend grub hut in manville. Tuesdays are all you can eat for $20. Solid BBQ with good portions can't recommend enough
Oyaz Turkish Cuisine - Millington

Shan Shan on Route 46 in Parsippany. Hole in the wall place with amazing, authentic noodle dishes.
The Burger King in East Hanover was a treasure, damn shame they paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Good Bottle in Maplewood for those of us east of the sinkhole
I‚Äôd love a place like this near Edison.
Love this. I go to Dry Goods Refillery in Montclair. Glad to slowly see more places like this popping up all over!
Yes! I love this place. The owner is so nice too :)
Also Sustainable Haus in Summit!
The Roost coffee shop in Ledgewood has something similar as well
I live closeby and had no idea this existed! Thank you!!
Does anything like this exist in Ocean County to anyone knowledge? This sounds amazing
How long have they been open? When I still lived in NJ I was trying to find shops like that and Sparta was only 20 min from me
I LOVE Greek food! Thank you for this recommendation!
Thank you I'll try it this week
Probably some of the best greek in the area. But their updated pricing and shrinkflated portions are a tough look. When they first opened up, they were so competitive but a gyro platter for $27 is not it now, especially after they downsized the portion.
Worked there for a while. Springsteen stopped by and dropped a 100 in the tip jar. Smoked weed there too.
They have a beer/wine liquor license at that location. Stopped in during a bike ride, first time going to that one. Ended up with a chili dog and a pint of blue moon
Omgh love Windmill
This!!!!! I painted a really psychedelic windmill after the Long Branch location cause I love that place so much.

Aa a vegetarian, even i will eat there hot dogs
The best.
Heard this‚Ä¶ never gone and been in area many times. Will have to make it happen.
Manouche is terrific. The food is fresh and delicious. Nice staff too.
I love Manouche! And the owner is the nicest guy!
Will keep that on the list I will be at brookdale church for an event in September‚Ä¶
I agree. Just never any worthwhile info in and around the Freehold and Howell areas.
What if I am Indian?
Or keep going down Oak Tree Road till you hit Edison. Foods just as good there.
Which restaurant
This is one of my favorite burgers ever. We moved to dover and still make the trek every few months when I get a craving
They lost their way for a while there during their meteoric rise to fame. I stopped by the other day and was pleasantly surprised. They‚Äôre back!¬†
I‚Äôve passed it all my life but never stopped as a vegetarian but i finally looked up the menu and it looks like they gave fun options! Gotta go soon
Say more
It's crazy how good the food is there. So highly under rated for the area. Try the cheese dip with the homemade chips
Will need to check it out, I go out to long branch, and pass through there sometimes.
Burritos as big as a newborn!
Everything at 4 Brothers is incredible! FYI for anyone planning to go, it is not a place for a quick bite! They take their time and service is attentive, but relaxed.
That‚Äôs a bold statement.  I have this bookmarked on Yelp and will decide for myself
I had brunch one morning when they had a live Soul band‚Ä¶ 
I can honestly say it was a delight for every single sense.
I love their chilli.
Thank you for this! My boyfriend lives near the area and we're always looking for date night spots. Gonna try to see if we can get in this weekend
Sophie‚Äôs is awesome.  Theirs steak frites are WOW
Oooo just added this to my list and VERY excited to try
Go when it‚Äôs nice weather! They have a back deck that overlooks the water!
They also make the best orange chicken I've ever had
I‚Äôve been meaning to try Nemo for years. Thank you for the reminder
I haven‚Äôt been there since they moved from Stanhope. Pass by it everyday. Need to stop in again.
i was honestly happy that espos got bought and that the new ownership mostly kept the same old school vibe that everyone who is from around here grew up with. that's unfortunately extremely rare in this day and age.
Espos vodka rigatoni oooof chefs kiss
Thank you for this! I‚Äôve been looking for good Viet food in the area!!
Broad St Diner, whenever I feel like it, I drive 50 minutes just to have their sandwich or burger. It's so good and the portion great.
Kabab Paradise is great.
+1 for Kabab Paradise. My wife and I are always on the lookout for good Chicken & Rice, and theirs is top notch!
2nd Broad St Diner - they‚Äôre fantastic and when it‚Äôs nice out, we‚Äôll get takeout meals and go eat them down by the picnic tables at the waterfront

Also Keyport Fishery - grab a fried fish platter and go eat it by the water. The best
Taco stop is so good!
> Taliercio's Ultimate Gourmet - Red Bank

They get so much hate on social media for having sandwiches that are ""too big"". It's so dumb.
Taliercios catering isn't what it used to be. It's still good, but it used to be better.
This doesn‚Äôt speak to their food but Taliercio‚Äôs in Red Bank is known for being big MAGA supporters. They used to have a sandwich named after Kyle Rittenhouse.
Can confirm this is almost a weekly craving for me and my wife. Marcy has not missed on anything we‚Äôve ordered there. Love the azteca soup.
We drive there just for the chips and sauces. My husband adores them!
100%
Great food with a side of a mid afternoon rager
honolulu hawaiian, the hawaiian bbq place in the same strip there is really good, too.
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Binh Duong has been rated best Vietnamese in NJ and still flies under the radar
> El Aguila Dorada - Bayonne

Some of the best Salsa Verde I've ever had, I haven't been in like a decade! Need to make the trip!
Binh Duong is fantastic - I was going there several times a week after returning from a trip to Viet Nam and missing the food so much
I guess I gotta go back to Binh Duong, had a rough experience about 9 years ago because my server had no idea what I meant when I said I was vegetarian and couldn‚Äôt eat what they brought me  when it was the wrong dish lol and the person ringing me up wanted me to pay for their mistake. I didn‚Äôt even get to eat.
They catered our wedding!!  The pear purse pasta was ü§§
Their pizza is pretty mid though.
best pizza ever!
Mancini‚Äôs burrata pie is out of this world
I have pretty severe lactose intolerance.

Their artichoke pizza is 190% worth the absolute hell that I live through after eating it.
Is that place still open? I thought it was going out of business.
El Tule is so good. Best fajitas I‚Äôve ever had, great ceviche, pozole, and lomo saltado.
I second Swiss Pastry Shoppe.
What do you recommend getting from Brownie Points?
Usually go to Pinhos but have been curious about Swiss Pastry since we moved to Union county.
Pandan room has always hit the spot, sooo good. And thank you for mentioning the claridge, I‚Äôve seen some unique films there.
Eaten from here many times, but never got this dish. Will definitely be trying next time!
I live pretty close to there but have never been, I'll have to give it a try.
One in Denville too
I love Veggie Heaven, but idk if I‚Äôd call it underrated. The Teaneck and Montclair locations are both super popular and well known.
So many good meals there over the years ü§ûüèº
Their cake has been a family holiday staple for literally as long as I can remember
I don't know about their other stuff but they make the best challah bread in the US.
Definitely putting it on this list for the kids‚Ä¶ looks nice.
I really can‚Äôt see myself doing anything there since I have no kids or local friends to go with, but I work in point and it‚Äôs just nice to know there‚Äôs people out here that aren‚Äôt maga üò≠ maybe I‚Äôll find a reason to go sometime, so thanks for the tip!
I wish this place got more recognition! Cheesecake is in the name for a reason too, it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve ever had. The flavors they come up with ooooo. I think about their banana pudding cheesecake like once a week lol. They are always doing fun new stuff over there. Great savory food as well.
Oh yeah. I went there for lunch one time with my mom and their broccoli rabe chicken sandwich was very good. I loved the cheesecake too
Love the belly buster!
Nostalgic, I hope they stay the same for all of eternity
The chips and sauces are bomb.
Ooh I‚Äôll have to go here! I live only a few minutes away.
I would hardly call it underrated with a famous chef at the helm.
Happy to see La Tentacion show up here. So well deserved and if you have mixed food moods you even get the option of pizzas that are also incredible. Such a great spot.
Yes yes üôå to La Ingrata‚Ä¶ so good.
This happened to me and Mi Pueblito in Kearny. Luckily they added a second location
Lol all the way down there? There's plenty more room for patrons in the resturants.¬†
Literally passed that 2 weeks ago! Missed out.
Ended up at mangia pizza‚Ä¶ it was outstanding too though!
Is that the place in island heights with the giant cinnamon roll?
Where did Red Bank diner go? It's still there.
Bamboo leaf is soo good!
Haven‚Äôt been in years, but never had a bad dish here
OMG the chicken with red onions & sliced almonds on pita is to die for. Used to get for lunch at old job years ago and still think about it often but don‚Äôt work nearby anymore or live close.
We also liked Hooked Up Seafood.

Next time you are in the area, check out Fish & Fancy over in the Villas. We‚Äôve never had a bad meal there in 20+ years.
Yessss
The best! First place I thought of. Now I need a turkey sloppy Joe üòä
*crying in Essex county* this sounds like a dream
Unfortunately, the original owner died. It's not the same.
There‚Äôs amazing Indian, Korean, Chinese, and Italian all over morris county. The Home Depot plaza on 46 in Parsippany has multiple great Asian restaurants.
Vreeland Store does have the best Mac and Cheese.  Red Barn is awesome.  I'd also add Tree Tavern and Berta's Chateau to this list (and Polski Smak since it's next to Fat Moe's)
Teglias is a great addition, great place to grab a creative slice for a fair price and it actually is excellent
I‚Äôve passed it without knowing, I‚Äôm usually on Horseneck Road and I see it‚Äôs just past the corner by Plymouth but I never go down Plymouth and didn‚Äôt realize it was there‚Ä¶ definitely have to stop and try it sometime.

Yea good one! Plus they have fresh food
Listen, we can make sinkhole happen anywhere..
Well,  if i see or hear of one I‚Äôll try to find your comment again. I wish there was a comprehensive list. Maybe Edible Jersey has a list published..
I think they‚Äôre the original or close to it. I used to go there . They‚Äôre great! Each shop has a different selection too modeled after customer requests.
She sure is a sweetheart.
The owners of this place what Trump bumper stickers on their cars.
Oh neat, I‚Äôll have to try it once the sink holes are not so impactful to that area! What aspect is similar with the Roost?
Aww , you‚Äôre welcome. If you‚Äôre in the market for new hair products DIP is from phenomenal. I‚Äôm not an owner or anything I just love their product. 
So much good stuff there. It‚Äôs nice bc it can use what ever jars you want.
Yes, there‚Äôs a wonderful shop in Tom‚Äôs River : https://onestopecoshop.co/

She doesn‚Äôt have the art swap.

However, this creative lady https://www.propagatestudionj.com/

Is the one connected with Sparta and also a new location in South Jersey (Woodstown) for the art swap. Check those out.

We‚Äôre getting a refill shops around more and more but gosh not easy to find in a general search.
Ummmmm hmmmm several years for sure. I forget I‚Äôm sorry
No problem!

Check out their instagram to see all the delicious food!

https://www.instagram.com/jerseygyros?igsh=MXJseTcxcmVoZmk2Mg==
Check out A Taste of Greece in Rivervale.  Really good
Understandable. It is pricey compared to other options. Quality is still there and I get a decent portion despite the smaller portions. (Based on getting food about two months ago)

Sometimes I get the larger boxes and sometimes smaller, guess depends. 

Either way, I still recommend them. I just get the chicken gyro sandwich(since fries are put in them) or just the Prasani salad.
Get the fries well done. They are so amazing. I‚Äôm sad the windmill by me closed(in brick)
Then you argue over whose mom makes the best biryani.
Leave them 1 star review because your mom made better Indian food.
If you don‚Äôt mind hole in the wall, Sher E Punjab. If you want a waiter, Moghul.
Yea gives the name of a road instead of an actual restaurant
It‚Äôs so good!! We moved from that area as well down to Somerset county so don‚Äôt get there as much anymore unfortunately. 

Perfect spot to sit outside in the summer and eat.
Lol happy to hear! Report back and let me know how it was. 

Can easily miss it coming down 46 if you blink a few times‚Ä¶
üî•üî•üî•üî• you ever been?
Right!?!?  I think we've had everything on the menu at least once and never been disappointed.  So glad someone else has experienced this place.
They opened another cafe in the same place in Stanhope.
Is that the place in the small strip mall next to a Nathan's? I've been to the Nathan's and the pizza parlor (which has some good home made empanadas btw) but I never went in to the Kabab Paradise.  I'll have to check it out next time I/m up there.
Taliercio‚Äôs in Red Bank is known for being MAGA supporters. They used to have a sandwich named after Kyle Rittenhouse.
OMG Honolulu is out of this world. I‚Äôve literally had coconut shrimp delivered and it‚Äôs still crispy. Magic.
it is outrageously good, same owners own Saigon Pho in E Hanover.  You know you're in a good spot when you walk in and you half expect frank reynolds to be at a table leading a game of russian roulette.
I have a few favorites for when I visit my mom in Brooklyn but, as far as classic, Brooklyn-style pizza in CNJ goes, I‚Äôm with you‚ÄîMancini‚Äôs is fantastic.
Ooh, will have to try!
Greatest testimonial that‚Äôll never make it into their advertising.üëè
It is still open. Was there recently.
Their menu has minor changes depending on the day (check their  Instagram for updates), but their donut-muffin hybrid ""duffin"" is usually solid. My favorite is their creme brulee duffin, but it's not a permanent item. Their brownie cakes are always good.
I love the Veggie Heaven in Denville
Excellent!
There are way more of us than there seem!
FACTS!
Something tells me you had the Hawaiian.
Yes and giant whoopie pie
Definitely check them out great lunch spot
I was so nervous to see this but I just checked the owners facebook and she posts anti Trump stuff and is very into environmental activism, maybe it was just a customer!
You must be looking at the wrong car because she is very anti Trump.
What‚ÄΩ No! I haven‚Äôt seen that! Bummer. I‚Äôll check again when I drive by!
It has a sustainable refill store in the back
Thank you so much for the info!
Thank you!
Solid recommendation there too!
Thanks, liked sher e Punjab
Because once you're on Oak Tree Rd, you'll understand.
theres 4 different restaurants on that road, i assume theyre telling you they are all quality
Hi Amber
my wife got the katsu delivered and yeah it was still hot and incredibly crispy by the time it got to us via delivery. the loko moko was also super delicious.
Bing Duong is some of the best FOOD in NJ period. They recently took over the laundromat next store and doubled in size.
I grew up in EB and now live an hour away but anytime I am near I ALWAYS stop at Mancinis because nothing comes close.
Where do the liberals hang out? I only have my mom and my niece and I work as a server/bartender so I‚Äôm wary to pry cause I don‚Äôt want to give people a reason not to come to my job‚Ä¶I‚Äôm from Pennsyltucky so I‚Äôm used to it but it‚Äôs hard these days!
We had that, and some other specialties in a large group‚Ä¶ chicken bacon ranch was a hit for me‚Ä¶
Oh I love that roll! Didn't know about the whoopie though! Yum
Okay! Same with us.  The vibe was completely
Opposite and her Insta show nothing of support for Trump!

This Railroad Could Cripple America's Economy,"Building great infrastructure should be bipartisan.

It's really scary how bad the  infrastructure is in the US.
But infrastructure is boring! ¬†And I won‚Äôt be in office when the project is done, so nobody will clap for ME.
Thanks for the reminder!
I will disagree with this. Not a huge fan of Christie but the ARC Tunnel was a bad deal for NJ. We would have been on the hook for any overages which was bound to happen. Estimated cost of the project was  $8.7 billionwith the feds/NY paying $3B each and Jersey paying $3B + overages. 

The new tunnel they are building costs $16B double the original amount. Lets even say the total cost was $12B for the original tunnel, that would have cost us an additional $3B. 

That's like going to a restaurant and someone says I am only paying $15 and orders a lobster. 

Finally the station was in the middle of nowhere
I wonder if we could trick Trump into helping the country for once by pointing out that he could just have his name be on every single project in the new infrastructure revitalization plan? ¬†Dozens of Trump bridges, Trump highways, the Donald has Great Hair power grid, the Trump is so Strong subway, the Greatest Golfer Ever, Donny Trump hydroelectric dam and so on.
The ARC was bad. Problem is, Christie just did nothing about it for years instead of working on a replacement, and set us back 10 years."

Interstate 80 is a federally mandated highway and at some point the Feds should step in and help like when 95 collapsed in Philly. 

Although that was a lifetime ago...
No fix required. Only peasants drive cars. Helicopters and private jets are unaffected. Plus NJ is boue and needs to be punished.

[deleted]
Is this going to affect other roads? I mostly drive 46 and 23.¬†
It seems like such an undertaking and I have no idea. I‚Äôve heard people talk about an overpass being a solution
But they already have TWO drilly things! Two! Can‚Äôt have more than‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ with 6 lanes and the shoulders‚Ä¶ and the median closed‚Ä¶
Sinkholes üï≥Ô∏è they‚Äôre the new drones.
Kind of off topic and may be inappropriate but have they explored the mines? Maybe some interesting artifacts are down there.¬†
Maybe OP has some drone takes too?
The feds have already stepped in....thats why im saying this is a pretty large issue. I mean you have a series of mines collapsing under 80, thats a really large geological issue. Im no engineer but I imagine fixing this would require idk....digging down to the mines or somehow filling the mines below the earth?? You cant exactly build a bridge over the area because then youd have a larger issue than a sink hole. 

I mean I guess theyd have to put piles down further than the know deepest mine in the area??
Feel like this is a temp fix. I wouldn't be shocked if they have to elevate that section.

These mines are collapsing due to the earthquake last year. Feel like that knocked things loose, and erosion started to happen.
This is different...this is like a massive geological problem vs a small bridge
Lol¬†
Absolutely, yes.
An overpass? Where a sinkhole could swallow up the piers holding it up potentially? Those piers would probably need to be pretty deep then, and fairly close, but I‚Äôm not a civil engineer. I wonder if other parts of the world have dealt with something similar, and how they worked around the issue
If its IEW on this, I used to pull machines for them. Those drill machines are like a few million so I wouldnt be surprised if they only had 2....and theres not many places that rent them out. Those drill rigs are also pieces of shit that break down CONSTANTLY lol
Doubt it....old abandoned mines that old are super supr dangerous to explore
Did you know Chris Christie shut down a beach for the public and then went to it?!
They will have to inject grout to fill the sinkholes, and use GPR and other geophysical methods to determine the location and depth/volume of those as well as any remaining void spaces that haven't become sinkholes yet so to determine the amount of material needed and the cost of the remediation. Usually this is an extremely expensive process as you need a lot of grout to fill up a sinkhole, and if the topography is mostly limestone, it will continue to erode as time passes despite the grout, meaning it is only a solution on the scale of an average human lifetime and not in any way permanent.


The wiser decision would have been to avoid placing critical infrastructure anywhere but for solid ground, but there's not much we can do now except for rebuild the highway so that it dodges all known weaknesses. Depending on the severity and number of these mineshafts turned sinkholes, relocating the highway entirely around them may actually be a cheaper solution than grout injections, but only a detailed analysis combining geophysics, engineering, and economics can really tell that tale.


I'm sure what we actually will get are a series of inexpensive half measures that do little other than keep the road up just long enough for the current batch of politicians to be out of power so it becomes the next man's problem, as is tradition.
I'm no engineer either but the easiest and cheapest alternative would probably just rebuild 80 around the problem area if possible. 

The people of Western PA have been dealing with shit like this for decades.
Maybe but I‚Äôm no engineer or geologist so I can only go on what the plan says. Op was ready to take up torches and pitchforks over not being told what‚Äôs going so I thought I‚Äôd share the public resource
Yeah idk I‚Äôve just heard ppl speculate about it but no idea if it‚Äôs even feasible. It kinda gives me a headache trying to imagine how to fix it lol
Remember Bridgegate?
I don't think they really had the tech back in the 50s to do this.....

I mean we're dealing with mines that predate the country so documentation isn't the best.
It's a rather LARGE problem area....they don't exactly know where a lot of the mines are because they date back to pre-revolution
I also don‚Äôt know how deep a tunnel in certain sections would need to go in order for it to be totally under potential sinkhole sites, and if that impacts interchanges
Even before digital geophysical mapping was widespread, they used to do large scale coring regimens on a new job site to accurately assess subsurface conditions. All GPR does is fill in the gaps between and helps reduce the number of core samples you need. Sometimes they still take hundreds or thousands of cores on big projects, mostly because the old heads in charge don't trust the newer methods. But that tech is old, way older than the 1950s, and even by the standards of the day it would have been downright irresponsible of them not to do a comprehensive subsurface investigation before undertaking such an important project as highway construction. And the records were there, I've seen old maps that show where the mineshafts were. They either just didn't care or didn't think it would be an issue until long after they died, so it was just build first and someone else will deal with the consequences later.
Yeah no clue. It seems like a logistical nightmare. And I doubt there‚Äôs enough gravel/concrete in the world to fill in the entire mine so I feel like any fix is just a ticking time bomb until the next collapse
Now I wanna see what their methos are....maybe they were given a time frame for how long the mines would last and being that The Jetsons just came out and it was all ""age of the future"" in the 50s maybe they figured wed having flying cars by now lol
I wonder how much some parts of 80 may need to be realigned to try and go through the parts with the least possibility of mine-induced sinkholes developing, while trying to not demolish homes or businesses, or any farmland out there
Yeah honestly back in the day, social responsibility wasn't really a thing. It barely is even today. The EPA wasn't even around until Nixon made it in the 70s. And it was the space age/atomic age, so maybe they really did think this society was going to be exploring the stars by now and didn't think something like this would genuinely still be a costly or difficult problem for us to solve.
Too bad we don‚Äôt have flying cars yet üòî
Yeah like...this whole project was being developed post war at the height of economic outlook. I wouldnt be surprised if the crews were like ""Were not going to even need highways in 2020!""
Maybe by 2347, who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Impact of those sinkholes on nearby municipalities?,"Basically, have certain places gotten either helped/hurt due to the locations of the sinkholes that have suddenly opened up throughout, particularly, Morris County, in recent days, like, say, downtowns such as, for instance, Boonton/Denville/Dover/Montville/Parsippany, or foot traffic at the Rockaway Mall?

I live in Rockaway twp  and it took me 35 minutes to get home today from taking my daughter to dance in Denville. It‚Äôs a 4 miles drive.  Usually takes less than 10.
Theres back ways to get to rockaway mall, but I imagine there has to be some loss of profit and foot traffic by people opting to go short hills or the bergen county malls instead of dealing with all the detours

the places that are hurt dramatically outweigh the ones that are not

the ones that have got a traffic boon are jammed on some random back road that people are avoiding unless they absolutely have to, so it's not translating into profit

The seller should keep his old plates because he needs to bring them in and get them destroyed. You could use them but if I was selling a car, I wouldn't give them up.

NJ11 Calculus,"What happens if NJ11 is vacated?

1. NJ11 seat goes vacant as of January 2026, likely for 3 to 4 months.
2. It is vacant until the special election takes place.
3. Special election determines who takes over the seat for the remainder of 2026.
4. There will be another election for the 2027-2028 term in November.

What about the special election?

The most important part of this is who runs. 
Whoever it is will not have the brand that Mikie Sherrill has in Montclair: less recognition, less funding. The candidate will not have much run way.

In 2024, Sherrill ran against Joseph Belnome for NJ11 rep re-election. 

Who? 

Belnome, who grew up in Newark and lives in Belleville, both in Essex, was a first time politician. He‚Äôs a building inspector by trade.

He raised $95k and used $140k of his own money‚Äî$235k in total.

Mikie spent $5 million in the same cycle. That‚Äôs 21x what Belnome spent.

The end result was 56.5% Mikie versus 41.8% Belnome: a 14.7% spread. 387k votes cast. (Remember these figures.)

Upon winning, Mikie ‚Äúcalled District 11 ""purplish,"" and said, ""I think sometimes it‚Äôs a tougher district than people realize.‚Äù‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs interesting.

NJ11 voter registrations essentially reflect the 2024 result. 

Dem: 217k=57.5%
Rep: 160k=42.5%
Total: 377k registered versus 387k votes last year. 

What is intriguing about the figures is that the Unaffilicated essentially sat out. 
In NJ11, there are 210k Unaffilated.

So, what if there is a special election in NJ11?
Turnout tends to be far lower for special elections, and this is expecially the case compared to 2024 figures since last year was a highly contested presidential election.

Based on the NJ10 special election in 2024, turnout was around 15% of regular. 
So we can assume about 60k voter turnout. Let‚Äôs assume they vote along the party line. 

Dem: 34.5k
Rep: 25.5k

Difference is then 9k. This is about 4 percent of 210k unaffiliated.

Normally this might be considered safe‚Ä¶.but...

But what if Elon Musk spends $1000 per unaffiliated voter conversion. 
That would cost him $9 million (he needs 9k+ to flip). That‚Äôs a small sum for him.
Also consider that the candidate doesn‚Äôt have Mikie‚Äôs name recognition or funding.

This is why I think Elon Musk can flip that district for $10 million. ",0.33,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jj1fkn/nj11_calculus/,4,1jj1fkn,2025-03-24 20:45,"I'd say don't count chickens cause this is a larger theoretical of Sherrill taking primary and the election, and while NJ 11 did gain parts of blue leaning Essex  and I get people think that plus Sherrill being in office for awhile means it's a sure thing, but one cannot overlook factors like the larger swathe of Morris that has been reliably red for a good long while.

I'm saying this as somebody who interned for past failed Democrat candidates in that district, even if you wanna remove the star power of elections without Rodney Frelinghuysen, I think it is a little foolish to assume that things are guaranteed to never flip going forward.

You're also right to point to participation and just past results Sherrill won, it wasn't that much of a landslide or that absolutely nobody voted for the Republicans that ran. Also I agree, special elections can definitely be something people blow off. I also think people overlook normally Republican leaning voters who specifically *did* vote for Sherrill especially occasions of more than once. 

 I guess my point is knowing what I've first hand witnessed and pounding the pavement going to everything in congressional election campaigns etc, I think people are underestimating any ease of a safety blue element to carry the next Democrat after Sherrill, there's a lot more  in play.
First of all, comparing results from a red wave presidential election to an off-cycle special election is not apples-to-apples. You are controlling for the change in total turnout, but not for _who_ will turn out. A scenario where Sherrill is elected governor implies a better electoral environment for Morris & Essex Democrats than last November.

Second, it would cost way more than $1,000 per voter to flip every unaffiliated voter in the state. Harris for President just spent about $1.5 billion in four months leading up to the last election, if winning elections were just about pure spending then Democrats would be in terrific shape.

Third, literally nothing could be better for Democratic turnout in New Jersey than Elon Musk spending millions of dollars to try and flip a blue district.
Agree. Just going over a what-if scenario.
Musk doesn‚Äôt need to flip every unaffiliated. He needs about 10k voter out of 210k.

Red wave or not, Belnome was a no name rookie who was outspent by 21x vs a 3x incumbent."

Seeking Legal Advice: Expungement Filed Twice but Still Appeared on Background Checks for 14 Years... It was finally removed last week.,"Hey everyone,

I'm posting on behalf of a friend who has been dealing with a frustrating legal issue that has impacted their life for decades.

Back in 1996, my friend got in trouble and served 6 months in a county jail. In 2011, they filed for expungement, but a background check later revealed that the record was never removed. They refiled in 2012, assuming it would finally be cleared.

Fast forward 14 years, and a recent background check still showed the conviction, despite the expungement being filed twice. My friend had to stay on their attorney about it, and only after persistent follow-ups was the record *finally* removed.

The problem is that for over 30 years, this has severely affected my friend‚Äôs ability to get good-paying jobs, and it feels like they‚Äôve been living in a nightmare. Now, they‚Äôre looking for legal advice to understand their options.

* **Where should they start in terms of legal recourse?**
* **Are there grounds for a lawsuit or damages due to the error?**
* **What type of attorney specializes in cases like this?**

"Anyone else seeing cases of a weird, ""mystery"" illness?","I'm in North Jersey. Last week, was going about my day and got struck with a headache, very bizarre head pressure, and sudden and strong dizziness. I had crazy brain fog, was constantly dizzy and fatigued for about four days straight. No amount of rest eased the exhaustion. Today is the first day I haven't been staggering around like I'm on a ship in a storm. Flu and covid negative (3 covid tests!) and no other real symptoms aside from *very* mild chest tightness for one day. 

Just found out a coworker might have the same thing‚Äîdizzy, head pressure, fatigue, and a family member is starting to come down with it too. 

I realize it could still be covid even with 3 negative tests, but am wondering if anyone else is seeing or dealing with this. Symptoms for all three of us seem to exclusively be fatigue, dizziness, and head pressure. No sore throat, fever, sinus issues etc.

The thing is, I have NEVER had a migraine before in my life, and aside from the pressure I had no other symptoms (running nose, congestion, etc).  FWIW my Apple Watch tracked a big spike in test heart rate during that time too.

Went away last week essentially overnight.
I‚Äôve had the same and turns out I have RSV. I don‚Äôt have children or work with kids, I work from home so I have no idea where I picked this up. I‚Äôve been super ill for two weeks.
i'm going through the same thing and just had an EKG because the chest tightness was triggering some anxiety and i spent the weekend at home because I got kinda dizzy while at my kid's basketball game Saturday morning

it's also allergy season though
Had something similar a couple weeks ago, especially the extended head ache/pressure part, not really fatigue but did have some body aches and chills but never any fever which was weird. Also had quite a bit of chest congestion which I‚Äôm just now completely over. I assumed it was gonna be Covid because it was going around some family and friends but all tests came back negative for Covid and flu. Never even got any meds just taking mucinex and Tylenol.
Have you had Covid in the past ? These symptoms could be long COVID . Many persons that have hd covid experience the symptoms you describe .
[Covid is known to attack the vestibular system.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurology/articles/10.3389/fneur.2023.1134540/full) For what it's worth, I got spontaneous vertigo-nystagmus 12 hours after my latest Covid Moderna booster in November 2024. I went to an ENT who DX'd me with acute labrynthtis, which gave me two months of those ""ship in high seas"" symptoms. It eventually calmed down and turned into BPPV, which I'm currently treating with vestibular PT. The point is, when I was telling friends and family around NJ about the vertigo attack back in Nov. 2024, everyone knew someone who had the same kind of illness you're talking about, and all assumed it was Covid, because again, Covid (and the Covid vaccine) has a longstanding track record of attacking the vestibular system. The fatigue and head pressure are related; your central nervous system gets slammed with vestibular issues. If it persists, go to an ENT (but make sure to choose an ENT who specializes in vertigo!)
That started with me about two weeks ago and then went on and off getting better until this weekend where my throat was so sore and scratchy I went to Urgent Care for a strep culture and COVID/FLU test.  All came back negative, but then I completely lost my voice for 24 hours.  Today the voice is back, but now it seems to have turned into a head cold with stuffy/runny nose, ticklish throat, and tons of sneezing.  Hope it resolves soon!

Physician here.

Do you have true vertigo, besides just dizziness?

Any associated tinnitus? Decreased hearing acuity?

See Dix Hallpike test. Diagnostic.

Or better still, the Epley maneuver. Diagnostic as well as therapeutic.

Excellent videos are available on YouTube, link to one good source:

https://youtu.be/DEkkhBP71aE?si=Ct0twwy9YIimD74n

(I am not affiliated with them).

See the video a few times, take notes. Preferably get a friend or family member to help.

The diagnosis will be clear and relief can be dramatic.

This, by the way, is what physicians follow too.

Covid. 1/2 the fam tested positive the other half didn‚Äôt. All sick. Longer incubation period. Used to be 2 days this was five days
I was literally talking to my coworkers about what could be going around. I had this weird thing that I almost thought I was having a seizure or something last month, and it was right after I started feeling like I was getting sick. Next day had terrible head fog, weakness, nausea, dizziness. I got better after about a week, and this weekend I started feeling like I was getting sick and had the same thing.
I had this and ended up being Flu A. Might‚Äôve been too early to show up. It was horrid
My mother woke up yesterday with a feeling of ‚Äúspinning‚Äù in her vision that lasted for a few hours. She read that it could be from an inner ear issue.
Dude this is me right now, wtf?!
yes this was me last week!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Apparently, according to my ENT a COVID strain is going around that shows negative on the home tests but shows positive on the PCR. My whole family got it, and the only reason I know it was COVID is I had one of my children tested at the doctors. Only my home test for myself showed a very very faint positive line one night. The rest were all negative.
not exactly the same symptoms but I had a weird illness last week and tested negative for literally everything at the doctors
I had a sinus infection once. It was headache in the back of my head so bad I couldn‚Äôt hardly see. I was so dizzy. I had just given birth and was still in the hospital when it started. They were treating it like a migraine, but no meds helped. My primary realized (5 days after symptoms started) it was a sinus infection. They can be strange.
Last week I had fatigue, nausea, and a massive headache bordering on migraine all throughout the day. I do have allergies so I‚Äôve been attributing it to something being in the air that day. I felt almost back to normal the next day, just a little headache and fatigue and no nausea.
Got Covid a couple months back now, same symptoms as you. Head was like a vice grip. I tested positive tho.
Did you suddenly stop (or start) a new medication?
I just had a catscan bc I‚Äôve been having a weird head pressure I can‚Äôt describe with dizziness. It‚Äôs been here and there for weeks. Definitely been fatigued too.. but who knows if it‚Äôs related??
So I had / have the same thing, my daughter brought home fifths disease from school. It‚Äôs parvo virus. I‚Äôm on day ten today and finally not feeling completely awful.
Its the flu . And those rapid tests are not accurate.¬†
Two weeks ago I had something and tested negative for everything. Not dizzy but a ton of head and sinus pressure, tonsils swelled up, bad headache and crazy fatigue. Lasted about 4 days and was gone. Very weird feeling.
My daughter and I just had this.  Horrible headache and pressure.  Migraine in our eyes. Completely exhausted.  Brain fog.  Then disappeared a couple of days later!
If this was more than one person in a shared location experiencing similar neurological symptoms, we‚Äôd want to rule out:
	‚Ä¢	Carbon monoxide exposure (especially if symptoms appeared while indoors)‚Äîthis causes headache, dizziness, fatigue, and cognitive slowing.
	‚Ä¢	Mold or other indoor air quality issues could also cause neurological and respiratory symptoms.

Otherwise - I‚Äôm guessing: 

Adenovirus, enteroviruses, or rhinoviruses may present with neurological symptoms, especially in the form of vestibular neuritis or viral labyrinthitis, which can cause dizziness and fatigue.
	‚Ä¢	Some viruses target the inner ear or brainstem, causing balance issues and cognitive symptoms without major respiratory illness.
Yeah that happened to me last month, mid-Feb.  Just as you described.  I had to take a day off and the weekend to recover.  About five days total with the dizziness and headache.
I did post yesterday because I did have every symptom that was mentioned and I  still have bad days.  I was reluctant to say how horrible it was and some of the different methods that I tried.   I did asked my Dr before I tried these.  The first one I tried was swimmer ear drops which I had because my husband suffers from that when he swims.  I put a few drops in each ear and a cotton ball to keep it in.  I was amazing how it worked.  I know that it sounds crasy but I was so desperate.
Same symptoms. Had it in the winter also and again lately. It's not allergies for me. Personally I think it's another covid variant.
The old Covid tests may not pick up new variants. Be sure to wear an n95 mask when possible. Covid, even mild infections can cause long term damage
Last Monday I started feeling dizzy and huge brain fog, then I got a horrible stomach virus (only bathroom stuff no puking) my daughter got it she puked once but was on the couch til Thursday my other daughter got it as well.. Thought we were done with it then my husband starts throwing up at work on Sunday.
Sounds like you have a crazy Sinus Infection.
I had this last week, multiple negative flu and covid tests. I also had a bad fever for three days, when I finally felt better my husband caught it
Great.   That's how I'm feeling today.
I‚Äôve been recovering from a cold/flu I started in early February. I have never had a cold/flu last more than a week and a half. This has been hell.
This was me. I had a lot of sinus pressure, fogginess, and exhaustion. I also couldn't sleep at all. Even though I was tired. And strange headache. Wasn't my usual headache. I also would get dizzy especially if I turn my head quickly. And I had chest tightness and I felt short of breath. And it wasn't covid. I did not have covid.
Last week I had symptoms of fatigue and pounding headaches on Monday that turned into a really bad sore throat later in the week. Tested negative for covid (there's a strain going around rn btw) and it wasn't strep. But by Sunday I was back to 100%
I have similar issues each fall and spring. I do nasal irrigation and it seems to help with the dizziness. I think if you had the flu or Covid you‚Äôd have a fever? Hope you feel better soon.
I‚Äôve had a dry and persistent cough and irritable stomach.
Huh, had brain fog last week. Short of breath at times (I assumed it was anxiety attacks), and occasional headaches that were on and off.
So I've never had chronic headaches or migraines before. However, a bit over 2 weeks ago I tested positive for strep. I started on antibiotics but developed killer migraines for 3-4 days straight. Symptoms included light/ sound sensitivity, closing my one eye because of the pain, brain fog, and dizzy/ losing my balance. I was miserable. I definitely know it wasn't sinus or allergy related. Eventually my eyes started swelling so I assumed I may have had an allergic reaction to the antibiotics? Over the following days the swelling went down, and the severity of the headaches gradually decreased. But I'm still having lingering headaches. Hope my experience offers at least some solidarity. It really sucks
i had this the other day! it started off with a tingling in my throat and then i had a migraine for the whole day and it went away like 2 days later. it was very strange
I had something like this back in January. The exhaustion comes back a few days after it ends. It took 2 weeks to feel better.
I had the same thing this week!!! I was so confused because I didn‚Äôt have any other symptoms but I did indeed feel sick with the same sinus pressure and head fog. So weird
not sure if it was the same thing but a few weeks ago my friend was incredibly sick with a 104 fever for several days straight + flu, covid and strep tests were all negative
I‚Äôm on day 7! No one else in my family got it! So that‚Äôs weird!!!
I‚Äôve been feeling lightheaded and dizzy periodically. It was more pronounced maybe 1-2 weeks ago. Also, I was very fatigued but I was also on a hell work schedule so I figured that may be the cause. Last night, my wife complained of pretty serious headaches and she‚Äôs not much of a complainer
Have y'all tested for COVID? That sounds like the new strain.
Weird question but have you and/or your friend done Botox recently?
Sounds like me when I had covid a few weeks ago.  My whole family was sick, including my husband, but he never tested positive. I did.
I thought it was just the time change. I hate Daylight savings cause I always get those aforementioned symptoms every year. I'm just now finally acclimating to the stupid hour change...
Funny you say that because one of the boxers I know at my boxing gym in Staten Island said he‚Äôs been feeling flu like symptoms for the past few weeks and is negative for flu or Covid, doctors couldn‚Äôt figure it out
Lunar Eclipse & full moon? ‚ú®Ô∏è
I have this right now. Headache, dizziness, nausea, brain fog. I feel like I'm hungover but haven't had a drink in 6+ years.
There‚Äôs been a couple pretty strong geomagnetic storms that have hit the planet. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs definitely what caused it but people forget space weather effects us all
Does your job have functioning CO detectors?
I am just getting over this. I‚Äôve missed 4 days of work and my weekend job too! I went to Dr on Friday and he gave me a z pak bc there was definite signs of sinus infection. I kept falling asleep like no notice, watching tv and next thing I know it‚Äôs a couple hrs later and something else is on. Mainly extreme fatigue, head pressure that I thought at first was a migraine. Headache felt like the Covid headache but it was negative
I had similar things when I moved before 3 months. As soon I would wake up, heavy head and can‚Äôt focus on anything, I just wasted days laying in bed. I thought it could be the water so I changed it. I don‚Äôt know if it was the water or something else but I eventually got better
Usually ends up being covid or RSV despite the tests.  Sometimes a few days into it the tests start being positive.
Similar back in January but it came on after having Flu-A. The congestion turned into a sinus infection which turned into a middle ear infection. The ENT said it's common to have those symptoms with the ear infection. Thankfully after almost two weeks on antibiotics everything went away but it was definitely odd and not typical symptoms I've had before.
I had something two weeks ago that hit me like a brick wall.  My diarrhea was straight up liquid for 4 days, roughly every hour.  I was dizzy and could barely stand.  Considered going to the hospital every night.  On the fourth day the diarrhea went away and resperstory symptoms showed up.  I then lost my voice and had a terrible cough for the next three days.  The thing is, when the cough showed up I felt great.  It might just be that I felt great in comparison to the previous four days.   Three or four negative covid tests over the course of the week.
First drones, they sinkhole blocking the major highways out of the area, now a mysterious illness.. Seems like the standard alien protocol for invasion.
Are you going to get a respiratory pathogens panel done?
Rhinovirus
I'm in Middlesex and 2wks ago had the worst headache in my life. Also dizzy and spicy. Neg covid didn't leave the house for 3days
I was sick recently!!!! And before this time I was also super sick 3 weeks ago.
My heart goes out to everyone,   I know how terrible this can be.  If I find out any kind of information I will share it.  All my thoughts and prayers to everyone
Metavirus. Cases are very high
what is with this sub and everyone making a post each week 'omg i got the flu/covid - so bad!!!!""
It‚Äôs allergy season so I bet that‚Äôs a big part of it
Sorry for your troubles.

I Woke up in the middle of the night with a headache (I rarely get headaches), took a Tylenol.

By midday today it was gone. Hopefully I am in the clear.
Oh that‚Äôs an illness?  I thought it was my allergies because we had those couple nice days.
My 10yo son actually just recovered from an illness that matches this. He tested negative for covid and flu. Had to miss a week of school cause he literally couldn't get up. He would just lay in bed all day and didn't even have an appetite. He kept complaining about his head and feeling sea sick. No congestion, no sore throat, 

But it took him out like the flu usually does

I had a thought of bird flu? But the other members of our house never felt like my son.

So it truly has been a mystery. Many of my sons classmates missed school as well.
I have had all of these symptoms.   They started after I had my 2nd covid booster.   I never had covid, but after the 2nd booster I  did experience extreme dizziness.   Some days it was so bad I couldn't get out of bed.

My doctor put me on antivert which did help.  He told me never to take another booster because the next reaction could be worse.

I feel so sorry for you because it really has changed my life.  I can no longer read because it will bring on an attack.

I no longer text, but I wanted to respond to you.  I have had to find ways around this.  On days when my ears start to feel fuzzy,  I will never drive.

Most important you have to stay hydrated.   My Dr has me drinking at least one gallon of water a day and it has really helped.

Please feel better and only do what you can.

My very best to all.
My son and his family all went through something similar. One of them tested positive for flu A, or so they were told. 7-10 days until they felt somewhat normal again. Idk‚Ä¶
Granted, I have chronic daily migraines, but earlier this month was something else; even excedrin (my only savings grace in life) wasn't cutting it. 

It was those days where we had some overcast stormy weather, going from one day around 70-71 degrees and the next day in the thirties, which normally would set off my migraines, but never had like this before.
Allergies man. You are probably just getting old. They never bothered me until my 40s.
Congrats. You had a strain of the flu.
No one thinks the Covid vaccine was the trigger?
As a woman who has been to at least one doctor in my life,  I can assure you - that was just anxiety
It what my doctor calls seasonal allergies
I had this too and I never get headaches
Huh, interesting. Other people are mentioning allergies, sinus infections, etc that don't fit what I mentioned, so this sounds close. Wasn't sinus pressure though, just sudden pressure in my head, then days of braing fog, dizziness, and feeling like I could sleep for a week straight. No cold or flu symptoms. Very odd. Glad it went away for you. Seems to be on the way out for me now thankfully.
Omg I went to the ER two weeks ago for nausea, feeling hot but no fever, and horrible headache. I never had a headache last for a week. After all the testing, I think I may have allergies. Maybe the trees idk, but I'm feeling better after using allergy meds & saline solution.
I had this too I thought it was just allergies.
I work with preschool aged kids, so RSV makes the rounds. Did you have significant respiratory symptoms though? I had nothing but a weirdly tight chest for a single day.
Back in November, my niece brought RSV home from Florida. It took me over a month to get back to normal. I did not get any respiratory issues, but I had all the rest. Not a fun december for us.
Normally I do deal with allergy issues this time of year, but this def isn't allergies. Sorry you're going through the same thing. Hope it passes quickly!
I've had covid, but last infection (that I know of, confirmed with test) was a year and a half ago. Would be one thing if it was just me, but two other people coming down with the same thing within days rules that out in my mind. I'm starting to think based on input from others that it's covid for all of us but just not showing up on tests or having the typical symptoms. Very weird, but hopefully we get over it quickly. I'm fairly recovered, with my coworker and family member only just getting sick.
This is good info; thank you! The dizziness is thankfully much less today, but it was rough. I was holding onto walls while I was walking around the house. I figured it was covid, even with the negative tests and unconventional symptoms and erred on the side of caution and hunkered down in my room for the most part. And with my coworker and a family member now having the same exact symptoms, it sort of confirms to me that we probably all have the same thing. Very odd.
I read that long Covid  can exacerbate/ cause pots. I had a terrible bout after having active Epstein bar. my son has been having a very hard time with dizziness and fainting these last months. Something must be targeting these symptoms.
Thank you so much for this info. My mom was in the ER yesterday for almost exactly the same symptoms and they weren‚Äôt able to identify the cause. They ambulanced her from an urgent care to the hospital for a CT scan, which didn‚Äôt show anything, and then gave her a prescription for a vertigo med that helped a lot. 

The funny thing is, she‚Äôs had vestibular issues for a while now (diagnosed) and has a script for some kind of vestibular fluid test that she never followed up on. She‚Äôs gonna follow up on that now after yesterday‚Äôs scare. 

Her dad, my grandpa, died from neurological damage from trans-ischemic attacks (mini strokes), which were mostly undetectable with imaging. That‚Äôs where my brain was heading until I clicked on the article you shared and it all made sense. Thank you from a stranger for giving me a little peace of mind. üôèüèª
I've had mild vestibular issues since late 2020, before my first dose and well before my first (and so far only) bout with COVID. Usually a few days of increasing tinnitus in my left year, followed by a few hours of intense vertigo, then it goes away for many weeks/months. Hearing test, VNG, head MRI all fine. Diagnosed with vestibular migraines ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Spouse has had positional vertigo since early 2020, seemingly brought on by a stressful family situation and exacerbated by lockdowns (much stricter ones, in a foreign country).

Boss has had worsening migraines over the last few years as well. Not sure when they started, but I'd say they're severe/debilitating at this point.

I think we're all a little messed up in the head tbh.
This has been so helpful to me. I‚Äôve had similar issues for years, way before COVID became a thing. I never knew it‚Äôs a proper diagnosis and thought my parents were just saying I had vertigo in the same way they say someone with anxiety has problems with their nerves.
I have been going¬†through pretty much the same thing including the negative strep test, except I didn't lose my voice. But I have badly swollen lymph nodes in my neck which hurt and my tonsils are all swollen.¬†


Because upper respiratory infections can easily go down into my chest and trigger bronchitis or even pneumonia (been there and done that) with my asthma I'm on heavy duty antibiotics to keep that from happening and to deal with the lymph nodes and¬† tonsils.¬†


But otherwise it's the same stuffy head with a runny nose, bouts of sneezing, lots of post nasal drip, throat tickle that makes you cough thing. One of my siblings is also currently battling this with bouts of sneezing, bouts of coughing.¬† Totally sucks.
I‚Äôm experiencing something similar. I have an itchy throat, runny nose, and constant sneezing. 

Normally I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs allergies because I do get spring time allergies with all the pollen‚Ä¶except there‚Äôs no pollen yet. I‚Äôve been taking Zyrtec but it only works 50% of the time. Yesterday was so bad that I took 2 Benadryls before bed because the previous night I woke up at 3am with the itchiest throat and non-stop sneezing for 2 minutes.
That's honestly what I've been thinking it is. Just because it's so unlike a regular cold or flu, and covid comes with all sorts of weird symptoms. I've heard the rapid tests aren't all that reliable and that many people aren't testing positive until like a week into being sick.
So weird. I almost *wanted* something to come back positive just so I knew I wasn't losing my mind. But since two others around me are dealing with the same symptoms, it's safe to assume it's some strange virus I guess.
I had fallen flat on my face and it did damage my sinuses.  I was put on antibiotics to clear up the infection.   Then I looked on Amazon and found this black mask that you put over your face.  It is electric,   you spray your face and then put this on.  I have to say it really improved my sinuses and it did help with my dizziness. 

I hope that this may help someone.  All my best to everyone and don't forget to keep hydrated.
No. It seems to be a weird virus going around by me but no one knows what it is and tests come up negative.
Could it be flu without any of the typical symptoms for all 3 people who have it? (Genuine question) No fever, sore throat, cough, etc? I've actually never had the flu before‚Äîthat I know of‚Äîso that would be a first for me.
same exact symptoms for me, plus glassy eyes, lasted for a week.. I started taking allergy meds but I don‚Äôt feel back to 100%
Yeah, my coworker and I sat together for 4+ hours at a work training last Monday (17th). I started feeling the dizziness, fatigue, and brain fog Wednesday afternoon, and she started with the same symptoms Sunday evening. My family member has no association with where I work‚Äîbut I was with her around the time I was feeling sick‚Äîstarted feeling ill yesterday also with the primary complaint being fatigue and brain fog. 

A lot of people are telling me to assume it's covid that hasn't been picked up by any of the tests. I suppose in the end it doesn't really matter, it's just been very strange.
I didn't have any sinus related issues or symptoms though, so it's weird. Especially since two other people around me now have the same thing. The fatigue was absolutely crushing.
Yikes! I'm so sorry to hear that. I've heard a few stories from others similar to this. Just weird, lingering illness that hangs around for months. I hope you bounce back soon.
I've never even heard of this and had to look it up. Can it just cause balance issues and fatigue? Says it's similar to cold symptoms but myself and the other 2 people didn't have any.
Yep, this sounds like what I had. No typical cold or flu symptoms aside from being bone-tired exhausted and dizzy/unbalanced with trouble concentrating. Glad your son is recovered!
Sorry this happened to you. It happened to me, too, 12 hours after my fifth (!!) Covid booster back in Nov. 2024. My initial attack was acute and lasted two months. I had an acute labrynthitis DX, and then VNG testing revealed I had BPPV, which I'm having treated right now with vestibular PT, which is not fun. The whole experience has been hellish and there is no cure
What symptoms did your family experience?
These aren't allergies. My seasonal allergies are itchy eyes and stuffy nose. This was something else‚Äîthat others around me are getting with the same exact presentation. Just insane fatigue, dizziness, and brain feels like it's encased in a vat of molasses. Current conclusion is covid. Thankfully seems to be on the way out for me.
No.  I was never vaccinated and just had this. Daughter same.
If you are female of a certain age this could also be perimenopausal related.
If not, my guess if allergies with trees starting to bloom. Bodie change every few years, so just because you ‚Äúnever before‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt start now/in the future.
I‚Äôm also experiencing similar symptoms today.
yeah, it started as a tickle in my throat and a bad headache, next two days were unbearable migraines and sore throat. Then the wet, hacking cough set in with the green mucus where I couldn't even breathe in between coughs and was throwing up from coughing so hard and the post-nasal drip constantly going down the back of my throat. That lasted about 10 days. Now, my ears are finally popping and clearing, but the cough and mucus are still there, I am hopeful that by week 3 I will be able to breathe again. I had never even heard of RSV before this, I can totally see how little babies and older folks die from this, there were times where I thought I might need serious medical intervention because I simply couldn't breathe, it was scary.
Holding onto walls, absolutely; that was me during the acute phase. Known triggers are caffeine, salt, dehydration, stress, and lack of sleep, so try to be conservative with those while you're healing. It's a terrible thing to go through, hang in there and I hope you heal quickly!
I'm sorry to hear about your post-EB POTS and your son's challenges. POTS is common for those suffering from Long Covid and other bad viruses; it's all over the Long Covid forums. Maybe your son would benefit from visiting a Neurologist? I see one now for my vestibular injury and I'd be lost without them.
I'm so sorry to hear what happened to your mom. It must've been so scary for your family and traumatic for her. When I had my spontaneous attack, the only thing that kept me out of the ER was a surplus of Zofran. I will say that during the 2-month acute period that followed the attack, there were a couple moments that had me wondering if I was having a stroke because a lot of those vestibular-neuro symptoms overlap. Great that your mom is following-up and I hope she's onto a quick and easy recovery. 


If you want some anecdotal reassurance, if you search the [Covid19positive](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive) sub and the [covidlonghaulers](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/) sub for ""vertigo,"" ""dizziness"" or ""vestibular,"" you will find tons of similar stories.

Hey, I'm preparing for a new ENT doctor visit and came across this blurb on vestibular neuritis (which is what I suspect I actually had, as opposed to the ""acute labrynthitis"" DX made by my former ENT). Anyway, it said this and I thought of you:


>Vestibular neuritis has some of the same symptoms as stroke, so your doctor needs to carefully rule out more serious conditions.


[You can find the document here.](https://balanceanddizziness.org/disorders/vestibular-disorders/vestibular-neuritis/)
I'm sorry to hear you've had vestibular issues pop up, but it sounds like you have a level head about it! I never had any sort of ear-nose-throat issues in my life so this is all very new to me. I never had Covid and haven't been sick since before the pandemic started. Glad your MRI was clear; I have mine later this week, ordered by a Neuro :< I also have tinnitus, bilateral, which came about with the post-vax spontaneous vertigo attack, and it hasn't subsided since. 


I went to a quasi-ENT for the initial DX (of acute labrynthitis) so my treatment was waylaid and delayed. I see a new ENT in a week. My VNG, which came three months after the initial DX, said left side BPPV and my hearing test said no hearing loss :D I'm now four sessions into vestibular PT to wrangle up the loose crystals and it's still not working; one ear gets cleared and then it pops up in the other. I hope your spouse has had better success in getting their crystals cleared!
I'm so sorry you've had vestibular issues for so long. Vertigo is an absolute beast. Please find a good ENT and a Neuro if you haven't yet! They will order tests to determine which type of vestibular disorder you have, and then give you a good treatment to better manage your symptoms.


In the meantime, there are some great vestibular subs on Reddit to poke around: [BBPV](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/), [vestibularmigraines](https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/), [Menieres](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/), and [PPPD](https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/). Good luck and take care!
UGH YES and the post nasal drip is the WORST.  I've gone through at least a box of tissues today alone.
 I‚Äôm not a scientist but it‚Äôs possible maybe there are strains that aren‚Äôt detectable with the common tests atm. My office has had this kind of persistent cough going around, and the constant feeling like you‚Äôre about to get sick but you feel fine for most of the day. A few of my coworkers have it as did I a few weeks back.
Feel better!
My kid brought something home. Flu pos. Then I got it a few days later, different symptoms, also flu pos. Then a few more days later my wife gets it and she won't test pos but has the same symptoms as the kid.

All i know is we got sick. Call it what you want but everyone was sick¬†
It was very weird.
Same as OP described above.
Yes thank you. I am menopausal & looked up if migraines could be an issue. I do get seasonal allergies but hadn't had head pain like this in about 30 years. I had the worst sinusitis while going to school in California. It's like my body wasn't used to the different flora & fauna.
I hope you feel better!üôè‚úåÔ∏è
Thank you!!!
What I was getting at with my 3 anecdotes is the possibility of it being stress-induced. But the BPPV and labyrinthitis diagnoses suggest it's not... at least that's my layman understanding, I'm not an expert.

Sounds like crystals *may* be my spouse's issue, though the lack of tinnitus gives me pause, and the correlation with stressors is strong. We'll see how PT goes and what the VNG says.

It's probably not crystals for me, as:  
- hearing test and VNG were normal;  
- I've had TMJ issues in the past;  
- it seems to be heavily correlated with environmental factors like drafts, temperature extremes, and noise; and  
- it doesn't seem to be related at all to position.

Have you/has your doctor reported anything to VAERS?
When you get nasty post nasal drip and you need to spit the junk out paper towels are the way to go. Save your tissues for the sneezing and runny nose.¬†

Ok, I see. Everything was reported to VAERS. A month after the report was filed, they wrote back asking for the batch number of the vaccine and that's the last I've heard from them

Is there any health insurance option in NJ for individuals that has out-of-network coverage? Any angle we're missing,"Starting this summer we'll need individual insurance in NJ for myself and my wife. We've always had company policies up until now. However, I'm having trouble figuring out how to get adequately insured, regardless of the premium we're willing to pay. Seems to be a uniquely NJ thing since friends in other states don't have this issue.

While no one wants to pay a lot for healthcare, we would rather pay more for better coverage. The problem is that none of the public options available in NJ seem to have *any* out-of-network coverage. We've never encountered this before. Even years ago when we were on an HMO, they still had an out-of-network option that covered with a higher deductible and lower co-insurance amount than the in-network. But all the public plans in NJ specifically seem to be ""EPO""'s that *exclude all out-of-network coverage*, leaving people partially uninsured for an open-ended amount of expenses. This doesn't work. First, we travel a lot and can't be uninsured if anything happens when we're visiting another part of the country, or need to by special trip insurance every time we go domestically. Second, anyone who has ever dealt with emergency or in-patient care knows that you can't really control what is in-network. You could go to an in-network hospital and have most of the on call people who see you, that you have no say in, be out-of-network. The ambulance could be out-of-network. Etc.

So what am I missing? Is there really no way for an individual family to get traditional healthcare coverage in NJ any more unless they are employed by a business? At any price? Crazy that even the most expensive options don't offer this.

And is there any angle? Can we get business insurance even if we are only a couple with small self-employed income? Are their any associations someone can join to get group coverage in NJ? I tried a few like our alumni association and for NJ they all referred back to the public options as GeCoveredNJ.

direct train from hackettstown to NYC. One stop, direct only. 

If you can get to hackettstown to nyc in 30mins. You'd split the morristown commuters by half of them driving out to commute in because itd be easier.  ease the load on the other train lines. 


Then a new line from hammonton or somewhere in the South that is direct and 1 stop only. 


Get all those far out places easily accessible to the city. Then a bunch of summit and Maplewood etc people will move further out and still have access to the city. Or even quicker access to the city. Allow and force development of those rural places. All the people with home equity would drive up housing needs in the west and south. 


Basically disperse the high density populated areas around NYC. Let people that want to live and work in those towns live there, and let people that just want quick access to NYC move further out.


But we're talking billions of dollars here
How about making all those years-vacant high rises that they keep building for no reason available as income-adjusted housing?
How about high pay and a cap on what landlords can charge for rent

California recently enacted a setup where municipalities that refuse to build the affordable housing the communities obviously need are forced to pay millions for the privilege, similar to the ACA ""tax"" on the uninsured. In the end, this makes NIMBYism unaffordable for the collective, thereby increasing their odds of okaying the construction of new units, rather than bleed millions just to not have new neighbors who don't make as much money as them/are not hoarding wealth.
A lot of uninformed answers here. What do people consider ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù? Like government sponsored housing or something middle class people can afford/obtain?

There is a major supply issue. Demand has reach astronomical heights due to quality of life, political climate, proximity to NYC, etc. There isn‚Äôt enough space and a lot of New Jersey is fully developed. People will continue to want to come so long as it is a great place to live. Unless some of those things change this problem won‚Äôt have a straight forward solution. It will be a combination of small solutions.

Banning or limiting corporate homeownership won‚Äôt have the impact in NJ that it would in the south or midwest. Maybe 5 at most of every 100 homes may change hands, which won‚Äôt be much, but still a little dent. The state should be sponsoring cleaning up some of the brownfields to incentivize new builders to use old developed land. That will make a small dent. Plenty more of these types of solutions will help.¬†

People also need to be patient. Plenty of other markets are cooling down so people will be incentivized by cheaper prices elsewhere to not make the move to NJ.¬†
Option 1 - get rid of all the jobs and prices will plummet. 

Option 2 - make other states like NJ and folks will move there.
Core problem is NIMBYs. If every township was mandated to build more housing the problem would be alleviated. I've seen developers try to build 10 story apartment buildings with many affordable units, but the Nimbys will say, that won't fit the towns vibe, we don't have the infrastructure to support that, there's not enough parking, it's ugly, let's wait 10 years to see how the first building will impact the town before building more, bla bla bla. Then the building gets talked down to a 3 story building and takes 5 years to build.¬†
I spoke to a builder recently who knocked down a small bunaglow and put up a McMansion. He said he'd love to build smaller homes but the zoning rules prohibit it and it's also not profitable. So first we need to change the zoning laws. Setbacks, lot size, ADU's, all of it. Then gov't needs to put their hand on the scale to incentivize starter home construction - maybe a McMansion tax on anything over a certain size, and maybe subsidies or tax credits for smaller homes. Call it the ""New Jersey Starter Homes for Families"" bill or something cuddly like that.
You don‚Äôt lol, this is a very desirable place to live. Prices will always be high, especially in north Jersey within commuting distance of NYC.
1. Tax land for starters. This will mean not only will empty plots of land owned and held by banks and other businesses be taxed, but also empty apartment units. It will incentivize landlords to keep rents low and for property managers to do something with their land. It will also push against those in commercial real-estate who own these large business offices but have only 5 people working there.  This means all those strip mall centers designated for business that aren't creating any revenue and taking up space will have to either also develop, bring business, or sell. 

2. I know very unpopular, but as a teacher this has made the most sense to me personally; consolidate the school districts to more regional zones as opposed to town lines make it county wide. This will mean our school districts will have to actually make merrit based education the new standard for high schools. The state can make NJ Transit subsidized for students enrolled in a state/public school so no additional costs for the school or town to put towards their own bus charters (unless needed for special services and for grade schools). Major cities across the U.S. do this and on a larger scale the rest of the world like Japan and much of Europe does this for their students. This will incentivize home developers further since now there will be a greater demand to build since people aren't as isolated to local zoning laws.

3. This last comment touches on our next point. Create emergency zoning laws. We can't outright abolish or make flexible the current zoning laws of every Township or county, however if we declare some sort of state of emergency for housing the state could help towns reach development quotas as well as bring in more business to much of suburban new jersey across many downtown areas. Its simply not realistic anymore for NJ to have these quaint ""small"" downtown aesthetics; we are the most densely populated region in the United States, if you want small town vibes move to Sussex, Warren, Atlantic counties, or better yet move out of state to Pennsylvania or elsewhere. We are crowded, we have to adapt our infrastructure to accommodate that. If NJ is going to also have larger corporations like Netflix set up shop here as well, we need to literally start building a vertical infrastructure, not wider otherwise we will face the same issues our costal counterpart LA (California in general) has faced for the better half of the century, we are already approaching that at break neck speeds and seeing some of that already btw. We don't need to live in the fantasy of NYCs shadow anymore let's start building our own new modern metropolis for people to live out their dreams, we could become the new remote work capital of the U.S. if we build the housing for it. 

4. Let's not just punish developers and those living in small towns, let's instead offer a tax credit to those directly impacted by the development. I would hate to be a home owner and have a 6 story complex and garage built right across the street from me and all the traffic and potential pollution it comes with. Let's give immediate impacted home owners (direct neighbors) a tax credit and see if we can have utilities discounted for state residents and owners (note if you aren't a state resident or have it as a primary residence then I don't think you should get these benefits), the benefits of this program could be for life with the original owners and then reduced with each sale to prevent abuse or inflated house prices in those areas. Speaking of non residents I think they should be paying their fair share if they are going to be living here whether it's owning a home or renting, that said let's try to keep a very minimal tax on non resident renters for new development trade off would be if the building has a pilot program they bear the cost of tenants utilities up to a certain rate (that way we don't have some tenants abusing some utilities in excess). 

I feel like creating better infrastructure and removing state and local development restrictions will help developers along with the additional tax revenue can be used to provide housing grants for low income individuals/families as well as for smaller contractors to work and help with these developments.
Bulldoze the golf courses and the secondary vacation homes.
I recall a planned local affordable housing development being called ‚Äúthe projects‚Äù because local cultists think any community involving HUD was attracting ‚Äúlow lifes‚Äù.  Developers get tax credits in return for verifying income and renting to people earning in the 30-45k range. Locals always complain about the lack of affordable housing and then literally complain about it when it‚Äôs offered. Without some sort of assistance from either the public sector, or a wealthy family, home ownership and even affordable housing is out of reach for many. It‚Äôs sad that some people think that any subsidized housing is a negative thing.
Too many people of wealth are buying houses to use as rentals.  There should be some adjusted propetrty tax fee for people who own multiple homes that they do not reside in.
Increase density in places that can be upzoned (including making it easier to do things like building a garage apartment), increased property taxes on single family homes that aren't a primary residence, and maybe some incentives for builders to build starter homes instead of nothing but 5000 sq ft McMansions on every open tract of land.
Strip zoning laws, hire more permit officers, give grants to companies that want to get started in home construction.
üôã Builder/GC here

We need more houses to be built

And not big or ""luxury"" homes in high end townships

We need basic ass 1200-2000 sqft starter homes on like 0.1, 0.2 (ish) acre lots

We dont build them anymore, anywhere and thats why prices are so high, you have a ton more people chasing way fewer houses and it drives the prices up
New Jersey building more housing would increase housing stock thus decreasing housing pricing.

People who own homes don't like that.
Change zoning to allow higher density housing (ie 2 family)
Get Thanos in here to snap a couple fingers
Build more single family starter homes  3 bed, 2 bath, garage, modest backyard. Create more small walkable towns with bus services and reliable shuttles to trains. 

Sigh‚Ä¶These arent hard things but we live in a country with unregulated real estate and property laws, corps get to buy out their hearts galore and developers are too lazy to actually make things to serve the community. They want quick cash and tax breaks with building on already overpopulated areas and making soulless ‚Äúluxury‚Äù apartment buildings that are basically fancy dorms with huge price tags. 

I beg people to watch netflix‚Äôs black mirror 100 million merits.. that is literally where we are heading.
#1 Issue is zoning. Each town has outdated zoning laws and master plan maps that were created 30 or more years ago when NJ had 8 million people. We need to reduce the number of townships, construction department needs to be on county level. Zoning maps need to allow for mixed use developments. Townships should pre-approve vacant lots which would allow smaller builders to build quickly. Right now if I buy a vacant piece of land it can take up to 2 years before construction starts, it will never be less than a year. All those carry costs are added to the price of the house. If I can buy a lot and start construction in 3 months it would be a different story 

#2 issues is that people want bigger houses. We could build an 800 sqft home and sell it for less than 300k but nobody wants to buy small homes. People want at least 2000sqft which can't be done for less than $600k to $700k.
If you have a law to enforce every company has their 50% office workers work remote 100% of time. Then you will see NJ housing prices go down. And we know governments against this because remote work means NJ lose residents/tax.
levy additional property taxes on out of state nonresident homeowners

levy additional property taxes on homes that sit vacant for more than 3 months per year (this would decimate the housing bubble on the shore)

levy additional property taxes on corporation owned residential housing

tldr - tax the motherfuckers that make this place unaffordable to live in. make it just as unaffordable for them as it is us peasants. make it undesirable for them so they leave and us peasants can have a chance again.

Build upwards and don't let it sit empty.
As a former mayor, I‚Äôm going to say we probably need to allow accessory buildings in back (or front) yards, allow for conversion of single family homes to two-family homes and to build up and not out.

We also need more middle-class (ie, not luxury) apartment and townhouse complexes with three and even four bedrooms.

We definitely need more good public transit and even microtransit.
System is broken, where I live builders sue the town due to affordable housing obligations‚Ä¶. Then build 200 units 180 are regular prices units 20 are ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù. This kills the town‚Ä¶ kills the school system‚Ä¶. Kills anything green. But the folks running the township which may have jobs in the realtor business benefit. They push Pilot. They should allow multifamily. So if I want to build a second floor to rent‚Ä¶. And that would lower everyone cost. Or just built affordable units.
Show us a master plan for the next 5,10, 15 years. Don't just say we're building affordable housing and that's that. What is the additional tax base going to provide? More teachers or higher pay? Revitalizing  the dead downtown strip? Social programs? Small business incentives?
expanding supply is the only way to make any progress. Multi-family housing has to be an option as well.
‚ÄúMake housing more affordable.‚Äù Lmao. Literally everyone in my generation who was born and raised in the nyc/nj area are all moving out because of how expensive this state is. We all get taxed out the ass and I can‚Äôt afford to live here either. I cannot wait till I can finally leave this shitty state and have actual property and not pay 3K a month to live on top of other people like rats in a barn. 

Enough of the rant the ‚Äúreal‚Äù way to fix it is to build more housing, but democrats in this state love to pat themselves on the back and say they are sooo pro housing until the housing development is in their neighborhood. The other way to make it more affordable is to lower the general cost of living, this states taxes are fucking outrageous, and most of it goes to bloat in schools, that guess what, I‚Äôm never going to use because I can‚Äôt even afford to own a house in this state, much less have kids here!
Density and legislate against corporate real estate and excessive property ownership by individual landlords, i.e: mom and pop with an extra unit? Fine. Some scumbag nepo baby with dad‚Äôs properties buying up more? Throw him in a pit and fill it with dirt. Unfortunately all of our politicians are also landlords.
Move to east bumblefuck pennsyltucky 

#
Your question implies that anyone‚Äôs opinion matters more than the fact that has been demonstrated over and over again with evidence: housing density = affordable housing. Any lot in NJ with even a half acre of land that isn‚Äôt being used for farming is being severely underutilized
We need to build more housing. The uncomfortable reality that democrats need to face is that the amount of red tape that they throw up is getting in the way. To be clear, regulations about safety make sense but we need to upzone and remove nonsense rules such as build off requiremnts, height restrictions, etc. Austin recently saw rents DECREASE after changing their building regulations. 

No amount of housing vouchers or setting aside ""affordable"" units will fix the problem of 100 homes for 101 people.
1. Prevent towns from using NIMBY policies to meddle with housing plans, outside of rational dispute
2. Cast an audit on foreclosed homes, then hire a workforce by the state to make any housing repairs. These houses will be for sale at discount by the state as a short term solution. We would negotiate with banks for discounted purchase at auction, or an ethical incentivize deal (i.e. low percentage royalties for a temporary time of 5-10 years as an on ramp for the banks to acquire new assets)
3. Work to make changing property classification as a more fluid process, taking to account hazards from prior use and occupancy for safe habitation of new occupants.
4. Execute a plan over the course of five years to build half a million affordable homes in the state of New Jersey centered around walkable mixed use properties. Plan them close enough to transit hubs to make it easier for families to access major metropolitan areas without vehicles. No vehicles necessary and lower mortgage/lease payments will incentivize younger families to move in as they work up the money for a car, a larger home, etc
5. Ethically incentivize nonprofit groups to donate structural resources (labor, materials, etc) to build new homes, and local community groups to organize building. This is not to use force or coercion to build cheaper home by both quality and quantity, but to mobilize as many builders as ethically possible to dramatically ramp up production
6. Work with union leaders and businesses to draft franchise expansions, primarily focusing on small businesses making less than $5 million dollars a year, whom could qualify for a grant to expand to any of the housing developments built under Step 4 to help small businesses expand operations, and to help promote local purchasing

And this was all on the top of my head
Build more housing. Get rid of single family zoning. Build tall, build luxury, build build build.¬†
As towns with the classic suburban single-family detached house vibe fill up, the only way to continue adding housing to feed the insatiable demand of the NYC area is to build up, as in multi-family/unit housing. The challenge is that doing this often changes the characteristics of the neighborhood, from the amount of traffic to local town culture, and everything in between. For a variety of reasons - some more ethical than others - people already living in such neighborhoods often don't want that and go to great lengths to stop or at least stall it. When you limit supply like this against insatiably growing demand for real estate in the NYC suburbs, costs skyrocket; that's basic economics.

If you're single, find someone to cohabitate with. Seriously, if you're not interested in dating, another single roommate will do. Because so many households are dual-income now, the cost of living for a given household has increased accordingly, and single people have competition from 2-income families. Basically, in most urban and suburban northern New Jersey, you have to be rich (concerning median individual incomes) to be able to afford to live by yourself (on a single income).

If you're already married or otherwise cohabitating, then you're going to have to do some research into neighborhoods that best balance your vibe with your budget. They're not as common as more expensive ones, and you may have to pound the pavement old-school style to find maximum value. Go to neighborhoods of interest, find out the local social spots, and ask around what's available at what prices. Forget the commercial Internet, which often targets the widest possible audiences (think out of state, or even out of country) to get the maximum possible dollar for whatever it is promoting. Someone's gotta pay for all those crazy affiliate marking commissions, right?

Good luck!
High density housing with walkable town centers. 

The myth that every retiree in Ocean County needs their own house is absurd. Put condos around the perimeter of Holiday city, drop a Lidl within walking distance of the condos, and free up a couple of hundred houses for small families.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way. These big landlords only make money by raising rents and selling properties. And I get it, it‚Äôs a business. They raise their value by raising rents. Unfortunately that‚Äôs the pattern. 

This is the problem everywhere. One day it will not be enough money, but the demand is there so they are getting what they are asking for
For homes to be cheaper there must be more of them. 
Who will build them? 
If we hinder privately owned, then we do, ie the government. I‚Äôm all for that, but you are arguing for public housing. 
I want big tall apartments and miles of townhomes, duplexes etc. Build apartments on top of strip malls. Build businesses facing the street. Build more apartments on top of them. But that‚Äôs all probably gonna be private ventures no?
Following because im a social worker
Change zoning
Kamala Harris wanted to introduce incentives to stop corporations from completely taking over and wanted to give first time homeowners a grant of like 20K or something. She lost but if we could still implement that here somehow I think that could work. Oh and put a limit on how many freaking condos go up a year (I‚Äôm sure there is a cap but still) those are directed at yuppies that work in manhattan and is forcing a form of gentrification on us. I understand that it helps put more taxes into the state but still, help us first ykwim
I think building more homes in underdeveloped areas and giving some kinda incentives will decrease congestion of the most populated areas and move jobs to the new areas .. houses are being built in the most congested areas where the most jobs exist is creating a huge competition which drives the prices up.. there is a lot of empty undeveloped land that can be used and eventually more jobs will shift to newer areas ..  just my opinion
The state needs to incentivize companies to be in NJ. Get banks and tech companies to build campuses in mid to southern Jersey. Barclays for instance has a campus in Whipanney but it‚Äôs in hyper congested north Jersey. Centralize these types of things atleast. If it was in Monmouth County then more people could access it within an hour. 

It gets risky when you‚Äôre the only gig in town. Say you put a high tech campus in Vineland. You get a job there, buy a house, then lose your job. You have to move because there‚Äôs no more high paying jobs. 

Long story short the state needs to bring high paying jobs here. The Netflix compound in Fort Monmouth is a start.  The housing will follow
build up in Newark and other urban areas where there is actually infrastructure to support that density. it's dumb to be doing these things at scale outside of those areas

enforce existing laws on zoning, immigration, illegal dwellings, to free up some units etc

it's always gonna be bandaids. Most of the state is commuting distance from one of or both NYC and PHI, there is a lot of $$ and demand in this area with not a lot of open lots that aren't protected green space. and the last thing we should be doing is destroying open space for some shitty section 8 crap
Cancel the credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. That would make it unpalatable for most NJ residents to work in other states. Residents who need to work in NYC will move out of NJ and demand for housing drops. Then maybe NJ will fight harder to make our commutable cities into job hubs.
Sell to people who are actually buying to live in New Jersey and not people from New York just buying a second house. Or idk sell to people who live in nj and want to live in nj. No offense against New Yorkers but nj is just becoming New York.
All the new mixed use buildings in my town have their commercial space rented.  But these spaces attract businesses that tend to lean more towards consumer services (gyms, salons, banks) or restaurants.  These are things which Amazon can‚Äôt easily replace. 

Large scale warehouse spaces/supermarkets are their own thing and really aren‚Äôt needed smack dab in the middle of most residential spaces.  These are best left in less desirable places like along side a highway, although I have seen some grocery stores that utilize a smaller footprint and can exist in a downtown location.
Here are two key challenges I saw on a project like this recently in my area:

NIMBY - People are often for it, till it's built near them

Tax Breaks - Developers are often given tax breaks to build.

in my area for example, the nimby crowd pushed a number of narratives, but the one I heard often was around tax breaks... It's likely not true, but the narrative pushed was...  Tax breaks the builders got meant a couple dozen families in condo's wouldn't be contributing towards the taxes in town. Those who have lived in the town were subsidizing these new low income folks. In particular, many of these new families will have kids, who will go to the school, but won't help pay for it with taxes, leading to more students per classroom and further depressing educational outcomes.

Stop subsidizing senior citizens.  NJ has many welfare-type programs where senior citizens get money from the government to stay in their houses.  If an old person chooses to live forever in their 5-bedroom house then we can‚Äôt force them out.  But there is no reason that the NJ taxpayers should subsidize that decision. Get them out into assisted living and free up the houses for younger, larger families.
Easy. Remote work. Government should incentivize companies to offer fully remote positions and then offer low interest loans to office buildings who renovate the space into apartments and condos. 

Folks who are fully remote can move away from high density areas and open up supply to the folks that can't work remotely. Brings the cost of homes down. There are tons of cheaper places to live in NJ but right now it would have long commutes.

State subsidize home builders to build new homes and land with restrictions that only first time homeowners are allowed to purchase and not available to anyone as an investment property. Pass strict laws with harsh punishment if people break the law on their applications. State would run checks to make sure  purchasers qualify. State would generate money from anyone who owns a second home in the state by higher property taxes.
If you want ""affordable"" housing, you either need to make more money or move. It's NJ. I know a single woman who works as an EMT bought a single-family home, three bedrooms on two acres, by herself. In Michigan.

And the problem with affordability isn't NIMBYs, or Boomers, or zoning, or parking regulations. It's the high taxes and utilities costs that are an ongoing, year after year, putting a drag on profitability for building owners. Most apartments were built years ago when building costs were lower. But the rents are still sky high because of the costs for school superintendents, police chiefs, fire chiefs, city and county business administrators, and all the union pensions that we have to pay. Our town pays the Medicare part B costs for all retired workers. And some of their wives to.
Build more moderate income housing. Less flash, less cash. No need for granite and hardwoods, just build units at this point. And more variety than just apartments. Some people want to actually BUY a place. Build condos and townhomes near transit. Every TOD development in NJ is exclusively apartments. Trapping young people into $2500 1BR apartments in Garwood and Metuchen is not going to help them save when it‚Äôs time to move up to buying a home, which the majority will undoubtably want to own one day. A condo can be sold and equity produced. Give people a fighting start.

And if you really want to get creative, implement a sales tax like every other state and use that for school taxes to reduce the property taxes without losing the income they produce for the districts. Let the out of state shoppers at our malls pay for it instead of saddling the homeowner.
Greater density.
I've never seen a case where the government raises taxes on a property and then lowers them

What happens when pieces of property are taxed exorbitantly and it's sold? Do people really think taxes will get lowered? That's not how government funding works.
Build baby build!
Build more houses
Just build more housing. That‚Äôs the only answer. It‚Äôs a supply/demand problem
Land use tax 

Statewide permitting and pre-approved designs of ADU‚Äôs.
No ugly mcmansions please. What happened to sensible homes with a decent yard? Not everyone has money nor do they want a huge family
Keep building that train to Scranton. There's so much housing stock over there and getting NYC access is going to make it and towns along it's route viable options.
>This problem

As a homeowner who currently greatly enjoys our VERY quiet community (with a VERY low vehicle traffic on surrounding roads) and an undisturbed view towards the densely vegetated area out of my bedroom window - I don't see the lack of ""more affordable housing"" as any kind of ""problem"".
Stop treating homes as a financial investment, I say this including people living in the homes, not just companies and landlords. Be okay with losing money on the resale, like you are with a car. We don't plan our retirement financials on our car holding or increasing in value, we should do the same for homes. But if homeowners bank their future financial plan on their home prices going up in the future, nobody will try to lower them other than non-owners (who then don't want their home value to be lowered once they finally manage to buy a home) How many home owners do you know that would not be upset at selling their home for less than they bought it for?
Start with statewide rent control. Raising rents by 11.50% year over year is not sustainable for low or middle income households when raises in salaries or fixed incomes don‚Äôt even come close to 11.50%. STOP THE GREED!!!
Deport new yorkers.
Get rid of all the warehouses and put single family homes
Replace the poors with richer folks /s sorry!
Kick out the yuppies!
Remove permiting. Or reduce the permiting requirements considerably to facilitate building affordable housing for working class people.


Remove requirements for property, e.g. parking, setbacks, and single-family zoning to encourage densification of housing.


Invest in public transit, trains and buses, across the state. Make it reasonable and affordable to commute from Toms River to NYC in an hour. Wildwood to Philadelphia.


Penalize contractors who only build ""luxury"" units. Incentivize people to sell their McMansions housing only 3 people and subdivide into three affordable homes.


Implement a land value tax.


But none of this has a snowball's chance in hell because NJ is NIMBY AF. Millburn as an example. NJ's tradition of full serve gas and no other options despite 48 other states with fewer brain cells knowing how to pump their own gas.
Rent control
Land and desirable  area to build - this is the reason low inventory.  People want to live near where they grew up, but these areas have limited new build areas.  People do not want to live in a high traffic zones or too far away from family and friends.
- Boomers selling

- lower interest rates

- down payment assistance 

- some smaller home options for singles, dinks, and small families

- incentives that attract positive community investment and participation.  If you keep your property maintained, contribute positively, and your kids are good in school and the community you get credits toward your mortgage and taxes.  Conversely, if you're a problem on the community and your family is making things worse, you get financially penalized.
Make local zoning inclusive.
Remove renting and vacant buildings must be auctioned and filled in a year. Also annex small wealthy towns. Rich people should live and pay taxes with the people they hire.
Stop building so many damn condo complexes with 10 affordable units and the rest of them market price, all it does is fill up the schools and fill up the roads and fill up the pockets of developers and the politicians who are making deals with these people. 

Build regular three bedroom two bathroom houses. Not the stupid giant white and black monstrosities. Not the tiny shared wall units. Nobody wants that. The way this country is going the millennials are going to have to house their parents so we need a place to do it that is not a tiny urban affordable condo.
Unless there are regulations limiting what can be charged in some manner (maybe relative to salary, or zip code, etc) no landlord will just agree to taking less money.
Eliminate corporate rentals for single/multi-family homes, enshrine mount laurel into law and not allow towns to sunset properties, pass legislation requiring banks to approve mortgage's if the total per-month cost would be 50% or less what the applicant has paid in rent per-month for a year, extend all benefits to part-time employees so that companies are no longer incentivized to keep people on minimum hours thus making pay go up and giving more people enough money to live (not really housing but...ya know), get rid of at-will employment and have all jobs have contracts so that they can act as collateral against home loans and rental agreements.
[deleted]
Probably going to get down voted but hot take: make more money, NYC is right there waiting for you to grind it out in a corporate job rising up the ladder.
Make people get paid more and make the businesses make less
there needs to be some financial incentive for builders to start building smaller starter homes again. I'm not sure what it is, but some sort of either taxes to disenctivize mcmansions and/or credits to build smaller might tip the scales. Builders will build whatever makes them the most money and gov't needs to step in an push the needle a bit sometimes.
I agree with this, but another issue is that starter homes don't really exist anymore. We bought our home as a starter home 10 years ago for $430k. Zillow says it's valued at $980k today. So if we were looking today with the starter home budget we had then, our house wouldn't be an option. 

How do we make sure there are starter homes, where people can buy something modest and have enough extra each month to put away for home repairs/renovations?
I'm seeing a decent number of new townhouses at least I don't want to share a wall with someone else again but it's cheaper at least
starter homes in my town are all getting flipped on the inside and being resold for like 2x the price they originally bought it for, so it‚Äôs not just that we need more starter homes, they need to be less expensive. a 2 bed 1 bath house shouldn‚Äôt cost $500k to buy
Because there is no other option for developers. Towns restrict the amount of multi family housing that can be built anywhere so when you‚Äôre stuck with only being able to build single family housing you have one option - build a bigger house.¬†

Developers need to make money off their purchase and they‚Äôre not going to do that by building starter homes. Hate it all you want but it‚Äôs the reality.¬†
Good luck convincing any developer to mak e less than. 30% on their builds, particularly when they have a years worth of backlogs. Unless it's heavily subsidized by the municipality ain't gonna happen
The problem is that smaller homes are not cost effective from the builder‚Äôs perspective to build.

I don‚Äôt know how we fix that.
Agree, but unfortunately those McMansions bring in more money and in NJ politics money talks.
Mixed income developments, radial networks of services and goods.

Neighborhoods with single, multi -family homes and apartments. That are connected to our infrastructure in a way that does not require additional expansion and stressing of our Network. You can look at cities like Calgary in Alberta and see how bad their network planning is. They kept building neighborhoods and now every service is stretched thin.

We shouldn't have that problem in Jersey but just building new housing in places where people don't live is not a solution. People don't live there for a reason and we don't need to have our services stretched even more. 

But we also need Transit. I know we're not good at it. I know it's not great. But it's a chicken and egg situation. It doesn't get used until it's great and politicians don't want to invest in something that doesn't get used. But that's the thing about a service from the government is that it doesn't need to generate revenue. It just needs to be good. And then it will be used. 

Property is just way too expensive and part of that is going to be stemming from property tax as well. If apartment owners rent their locations at a certain value at or below a market rate. They could be offered a tax incentive. I don't know the feasibility of this but we have to drive the bottom price down.
The word is NIMBY. People who claim they're ""all for"" the housing until its in their neighborhood. Its also always some nonsense answer like ""our taxes will go up"". When that is not how it even remotely works. 



People who live in apartments PAY TAXES. They pay it directly with their sales tax, and indirectly through their rent. 

  
To add to the other response you received, allow people to expand their properties with backhouses.
Also, prioritize public transit and walkability, otherwise the increase in housing will cause  perpetual gridloc
> Just build shit. Lots of it. For people at all income levels. Period. 

We wasted 80 years overbuilding far-flung suburbs. 

So last year there was flooding, this year its sink holes - all so some New Yorker can put a McMansion in the Pine Barrens? 

Nuts to that. 

Build SMARTER than the past. Have restraint. Common sense. Invest in good engineering & good infrastructure.
They are building commercial buildings in Fort Monmouth on Oceanport Ave. They should put apartments on top that middle class people can afford. Not the 3k a month luxury apartments or the affordable housing that is income restricted but average apartments for people who make 60-100k a year. Those kinds of places are non-existent.
This is the only way to solve it , you build. Every one wonders why no one does any thing but when some one does try and do something home owners come out of the wood work "" b-b-but the value of my house !"" no matter what side of the isle you stand on , building is the only solve to the problem.
As far as number 3 is concerned. Any commercial/industrial property that hasn‚Äôt been occupied in a decade should be sold and re-zoned for residential or mixed use.  I have seen many unused commercial properties that haven‚Äôt been touched for who knows how long just rot away.  Clearly this land can be used for something else.
Any reading you recommend on #3? I‚Äôve heard people say this before but I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around how that works
Just build more housing
And somehow doing #2 will make the landlords not raise rent to compensate for these new taxes?
I think number 1 should be incredibly curtailed (as in implemented). I think allowing corporate ownership of residential property to the extent it‚Äôs allowed is wild. I understand like owning apartment buildings and those sort of large scale developments but single family homes should not be a hotbed for corporate flippers. Idk the solution tho since how do you legislate the distinction say between a corporate owner and an individual who sets up a corporation to own their home for any variety of legal reasons. Idk if that‚Äôs a large concern tho; maybe just legislate the same protections for individual homeowners as would a corporation.
All three are excellent ideas
For homes to be cheaper there must be more of them. Who will build them? If we hinder privately owned, then we do, ie the government. I‚Äôm all for that, but you are arguing for public housing. I want big tall apartments and miles of townhomes, duplexes etc. Build apartments on top of strip malls. Build businesses facing the street. Build more apartments on top of them. But that‚Äôs all probably gonna be private ventures no?
For #3 - a land value tax.¬†
Ban corporations from owning homes is better.
Private owners will just increase rent to compensate.
This is probably the best answer. But no matter what, at least in my opinion, nj will never truly be affordable as long as it‚Äôs desirable.

NJ did receive 12 billion in infrastructure money
Right now it takes about 2.5 hours to get to the city from Hackettstown. Would greatly spread out people having accessible trains that far out. Also you could have it stop in Hackettestown, netcong, mount olive, hopatcong, and Mount Arlington then express to the city which would cut down traffic and increase people moving out west. Unfortunately the train is not electrified on that track so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever happen.
the first line is one of the few interesting thoughts about transit ever in this sub.

rail is trash because once you're outside of bergen, passaic, etc you are looking at a haul. Someone coming from Hackettstown or Dover is well over 1.5hrs each way just for the train ride

you could add a million more stops and lines out that way, if you're consistently over an hour frm NYC/PHI it is never going to be heavily used
I have enough property to build another entire house and I‚Äôm not allowed to. It‚Äôs such a waste of land. We could see so many ADUs hit the market within a few months if we approved it.
If that was the case then places like Hoboken, NYC and Jersey City would be cheap
Oooooh is that why NYC (the densest area in the US) is so affordable?
They also have the builders remedy just like in NJ which basically allows developers to ignore the zoning laws of towns haven‚Äôt built enough affordable housing¬†
So you're telling me people like a thing and that thing isn't cheap no matter how many artificial tricks are tried?
Option 2 freaks me out; there are too many states that are ass backwards. I'd hate to leave this area.
As far I'm concerned, a lot of NJ towns are mandated to build apartments with affordable units. In my town, Scotch Plains, that's all people have been complaining about because we were told from the state to do this. I don't mind building apartment buildings with affordable units, it's just half the time the units aren't even affordable, and also...they want the towns to have X amount of affordable units but the towns barely have enough space for these buildings to begin with. 

https://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2024/10/28/nj-affordable-housing-obligations-by-town/75807216007/
Zoning is not the issue. If he can build a McMansion, which takes up more space, then building a smaller home on the same lot should be no problem. ADUs can help housing shortages, sure, but he could have renovated the small bungalow and simply built an ADU in the backyard if that was the case.

He just wants more money.
‚ÄúState of emergency‚Äù? Why the fuck do we have to do that? Pass a normal law thru the normal democratic process. Elect YIMBY politicians.
Because demand is too high. We don‚Äôt have enough space to build out so we need to build up.¬†
There are a lot of people who can‚Äôt afford a $800k house but nobody builds new small houses here.
Stop letting developers shirk their tax responsibilities with bullshit PILOT programs that only line their own pockets and those of the local politicians while telling existing residents ‚Äúsorry we have to raise your property taxes yet again, wish there was something we could do‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The only real answer.
‚ÄúThe schools in NJ are fantastic. Your child will get a great education. ‚Äú


They get the same education for most middle class areas.  My kids and my cousins children in Denver and my other cousins children in Idaho (moved for a new job) for way more money than he made here, in  Cor de lene for a hell of home on on a large property, for 700k. absolutely beautiful there. Of course our schools are better than some poverty ridden town in Arkansas or Mississippi, but it‚Äôs expensive to live in general. NJ isn‚Äôt full of fantastic schools they lie to us and people want to believe 
 It to justify the insane taxes. 


I remember before we had our kids we paid Paid 8 grand a year in property taxes on a townhome we purchased back in 09. I remember being so pissed. Signing on that for zero property and a fishbowl that bored neighbors would just casually stare up at you from outside, as your sitting on your sofa watching the game. Luckily we bought our home and a foreclosure down at the beach before  these psychotic prices. I would not be able to afford or find a home I wanted and afford 13k a year in property taxes.


I feel your pain, and everyone who wants to stay here but are priced out but there will never be an 2008 level crash in our lifetime and it‚Äôs just going to continue going up. Prices may be going down in the damn poconos  or Texas and Utah but they will never go down in this state again.
Knowledge workers should be allowed to work remote at least most of the time;  it isn‚Äôt 1953 despite what is happening in DC.
It is true. Look up PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) programs. That‚Äôs exactly what happens. Developers pay an upfront fee to the town that in return exempts them from paying any property taxes for anywhere from 10-30 years. These payments do NOT have to be shared with the school. It‚Äôs basically a slush fund for politicians‚Äô pet projects while the property taxes of existing homeowners continue to skyrocket to absorb the costs of educating the children that enter the school district. 

It‚Äôs a huge problem. I know you‚Äôre not allowed to point this out without being called a NIMBY but that‚Äôs not what this is. I have no issue with a developer building apartments in my town. But if they are going to make money building the apartments then they need to bear a certain amount of responsibility for the money it‚Äôs going to cost existing residents.

I‚Äôm absolutely sick to death of the bullshit narrative pushed that if you question this in any way, you‚Äôre just a rich nimby that doesn‚Äôt want poor people breathing the same air. Meanwhile the developers are getting sweetheart deals, the politicians are getting big fat payments for whatever vanity projects they want and then they all point to the residents who‚Äôs taxes just went up AGAIN and say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want you in their fancy pants town.‚Äù
The rich don‚Äôt eat their own just us.
We don‚Äôt need more housing.  We need the housing we already have to be affordable.  Airbnb, massive corporations holding property values hostage are much more important than building new construction
That has happened with the pandemic and has led to skyrocketing prices in the lower density areas. And considering NJ is lower density than NYC, I'm not sure how much that would help NJ, nevermind how it would affect housing prices in very rural areas outside NJ.
Most people's ""wealth"" is in their home value. 

Over 50% of Americans attach their financial well-being to their home value because they do not own other assets nor financial assets.

Why should someone be okay taking a loss on an appreciable asset?
[deleted]
The answer for how to make life better for the middle class shouldn‚Äôt be, ‚Äúbe alright with losing money on the resale.‚Äù
Ah yes take a loss on an asset that can appreciate in value and/or bring income in the form of rental property. Just give away free money‚Ä¶ you know what I think grocery stores should also take a loss on the product they sell, discount them to less than what they bought it for.
This has proven not to be a positive solution for society
Lol then where you supposed to live if you can't afford to buy a home if renting is illegal?
[deleted]
Lololol
What business‚Äôs? I assume you think that when they say we are going to tax the businesses you think they mean the billion dollar companies funding their political agenda. No they tax the little guy trying own a small business and raise a family who than gets priced out by big box billion dollar companies and corps.
This is (part of) the answer.  In addition to building more starter homes, towns have to not fight the additional homes.  Some combination of sticks and carrots from the state.  Builders would build, but some towns are a real PIA in allowing new homes.
Even in my town 980k is not close to the most expensive but it‚Äôs way bigger than a starter home
More density¬†
I know it‚Äôs wishful thinking
Not a NIMBY, but tax abatements make it so the apartment buildings pay very little or no taxes for a certain period of time. State taxes (sales tax) is different from local funding (property taxes) that goes towards the schools, town and county. Under the current scenario taxes would increase unless something is done. I wish the state would address this at an adequate level to remove a talking point from NIMBYs.
In lots of towns, the tax levy of an additional housing unit (especially apartments) doesn't offset the added burden placed on the township. Schooling is the majority of my taxes, and adding new apartment units has a direct correlation to increased load on the already at-capacity school system. That in turn means new capital projects to expand schools which is... More taxes.

You don't actually understand why more housing means increased taxes, but it's actually true in a lot of towns. I agree that more (affordable) housing is what's needed, but you can't ignore the real problems created by it in our current system. 

To be a little more constructive, id love to see townships merge and services consolidated. That's how you reduce the cost of running a town and how creating more housing becomes a net positive tax revenue stream.
Found the NIMBY!¬†

Really though, you‚Äôre just talking shit. No new housing, no density, but also we must keep New Yorkers out of the Pine Barrens (?) and we must have ‚Äúrestraint‚Äù! Tell me next that we need to sue to stop all development because they cause shadows. Thank god you‚Äôre in charge of nothing.¬†
God I would love this. So many eyesores all over the place.
Guess it depends on the commercial/industrial property, I don't think anybody wants to be living on top a bunch of buried chromium or something. Some of these places aren't rezoned and redeveloped for good reasons.
The problem is that cities and towns insist on that much commercial space.

Most places are now extensively overloaded with smaller commercial space because of zoning requirements written pre internet.  People don‚Äôt shop in person nearly as much as they used to, yet the amount of smaller commercial spaces has grown exponentially.

So builders make them in places knowing they will sit empty and residential above is where the money to subsidize it + profit comes from.

People forget that every Amazon item you get used to be a trip to a random store. The average home gets something like 5-6 packages a week. That‚Äôs 5-6 less stores you visit every week.

We need to substantially cull commercial spaces, especially smaller ones.  Or alternatively put a heavy tax on e-commerce transactions. Something like 20% + sales tax.

People like the idea of quaint streets with cute stores‚Ä¶ that *other* people patronize.

What we‚Äôre short on is larger commercial spaces with things like loading docks. We don‚Äôt have enough grocery stores in a lot of places and the lack of competition isn‚Äôt good for prices.
You write off the rent as a loss. Sometimes it winds up being better for the owner financially to hold a piece of vacant property and say, I‚Äôm losing on $10,000 a month in rent than it is to rent it out for the $2,000 it is actually worth.
Fees for landlords who just keep vacant buildings waiting on a payday.  For es them to sell or rent it
Also consider that property taxes are usually based on how many rooms are in a house (more bedrooms = more taxes). So therefore if someone has an empty lot then the taxes will be lower. But the empty lot provides zero value to anyone who lives in the area.¬†

Not all of them are empty lots but many are intentionally underdeveloped.¬†
you can't because it's straight up wrong and these idiots are parroting it lol

there isn't a write off that exits for having a vacant property
This is the only solution. Screw everyone's feelings. Just need to build build build. Have a competition to see who can build the most homes.
Doesn‚Äôt solve anything if the new housing gets scooped up in bulk by a corporation.
Are single family homes even owned to a large extent by corporations?
High density*
I really like the implication of ""I haven't seen a doctor about this but this can't be the way everyone else thinks, right?""
A lot of it is going to the Gateway which would improve train service for everyone¬†
Demand still outpaces supply in those areas.
Now imagine how expensive it would be if it had half as many units¬†
It can be both the densest area in the US and still not dense enough. It all comes down to housing supply and level of demand of people wanting to live there.
NYC builds almost no housing. That‚Äôs why Hudson County is expensive.¬†
You said it better than I. It must be a principal of some kind.
I haven't been following this closely but I recall many towns have been resisting and fighting it in court.¬†


Personally, I'd like to see old buildings get town down and start seeing developers build taller.
They have plenty of space to build apartments they just hate change¬†
Are you suggesting that people who buy properties and resell them are just trying to make money?¬†

What??
>State of emergency‚Äù? Why the fuck do we have to do that?

First off you forgot the ""quotes"" which was meant to emphasive the figurative imperative of the housing crisis. 

The rate of new housing and housing availability being far below expected demand, the massive influx of people into the state whether they become permanent residents or are transient workers/landlords/etc despite what the state data shows more people moving out of jersey is not greater than the amount people and business moving here. Numerous towns petitioning against what actual residents probably want (130+ towns suing the state over affordable housing). 

>Pass a normal law thru the normal democratic process. Elect YIMBY politicians.

New here? NJ is one of the biggest NIMBY states and always has been for generations for both parties mind you. Remember Jim Crowe? NJ was in favor of segregationist policies and more so even exercised such segregationist and discriminatory practices in recent history as well. When the civil rights act was passed many local and state politicians across many now integrated cities tried to work against civil rights policies by dividing neighborhoods through red lining and redistricting for school and bus zones, which NJ has a dark history in as well in places like Newark (and surroundingneighborhoods), Trenton, Jersey City, and Paterson to name a few . 

So no electing YIMBY politicians is not realistic and would take too long, passing legislation in this state is borderline corruption and takes forever to go in effect unless it lines politicians' pockets. Executive action could be taken to reach a fair compromise with the state's ongoing legal battles against these towns protesting. Let the towns pick the developers and the state determines a budget for the project. 

We have tons of talented, educated, and creative people that are being forced out of this state simply because it's become impossible to afford to live here unless you come from a family that is the top percent of household income. Even middle class families who have been established here and have adult children are struggling in this housing economy.
In our town, the developer of the most recent apartment complex secured a 15-year tax abatement. How many other developers skate their obligations because of overly generous local politicians? I'd bet way more than just the one developer in my town.
[deleted]
Born and raised in middle class Essex County and I can‚Äôt agree more on the ‚ÄúThe schools in NJ are fantastic‚Äù rhetoric. It‚Äôs a laugh to keep from crying. My kids are in a totally different state where the taxes aren‚Äôt even close to what we were paying in NJ and the school system that they‚Äôre in now surpasses in quality. Nj is a rip off when it comes to quality QOL. No one goes to the city or the shore that much for what‚Äôs expected in taxes. Housing will never be affordable because too many people are think they‚Äôre ‚Äúmissing out on NJ‚Äù.
Hybrid schedules seem to work best in my experience. 2 days in the office to connect and collaborate.
Pandemic was temporary remote. No one was making long term decisions so they wouldn't move that far away. Plus interest rates really drove the prices up. 

Long term remote and people move to middle America where homes are very cheap. It'll drive the prices there up but itll spread Americans out.
If their financial plan isn't based on their home value, it's a lot easier to take a loss. We should make it so people can plan their financial well being around their expected income and not just their home in retirement.
> Cars are inherently depreciating assets so that‚Äôs a loss that can‚Äôt really be controlled other than trying to extend the lifespan of your beater as long as you can

Why's that inherent and not just the way it happens to be? Have you seen prices for some classic cars? They definitely go up from the original price they were purchased at. The rate that homes inflate here isn't inherent. If you look at other countries where people don't move as often, and/or have family live in the home for longer, you don't see the same pressure to sell at a gain, you just stay in the home you have. Instead of downsizing from a home that is too large and selling because there aren't as many people living in the home, you can simply keep more people living in the home. If you plan to live in the home for life, you don't include the sale of a home in your retirement financials. You are right, it is hard to ask people to sell at a loss when that's been the normal plan for so long. I'm suggesting to more often consider not selling.
The question wasn't how to make life better for the middle class? It was how to make housing more affordable? But you are getting at something, this would be most beneficial for the lower class. The people who don't yet own a home.
I'm not at all suggesting giving away free money.  Also income from rent is definitely not free, you are offering a service, only shitty landlords offer nothing for the rent they collect. I'm just saying buy a home for shelter, don't rely on it to return a profit. The whole point is to prevent them from appreciating in value, that's how you keep homes affordable.
You can allow people to live in your house for rent but apparently selling your house to that person is impossible. Perhaps the reason they can't afford it is because someone is making a living on those people.
Hard disagree, for my already stated points. Do you even have any idea how many condo complexes have to go up in any given town for them to meet the required affordable housing amounts? It‚Äôs insane. Check out which town politician is friends with which developer.  All the while people are clamoring for single family houses because thats what most people want. 

There needs to be new laws made in that if a town is forced to build these condo developments and add to the population, the schools need to be made larger, the roads and infrastructure needs to support these extra people. 

But that doesn‚Äôt happen. Building more housing is a shortsighted Band-Aid if everything else is ignored.
All of them. All businesses should be making less money and people should be getting paid more. The money needs to be split up more. There is no reason the owners are getting all the profit. There is plenty of money to go around. Everyone always says if you raise wages the business with just raise the prices. It‚Äôs untrue. In the 60s and 70s businesses were doing just fine and making money. Wages just haven‚Äôt kept up with prices. People just need to get paid and the government needs to step in and say they can‚Äôt raise prices. It‚Äôs just greed.
Ding ding ding. Lower prices will attract ‚Äúthem‚Äù and we all know how that conversation goes. Towns fight affordable housing because it‚Äôll lower existing home values and racism.
Too simple. 

Look at Hudson County or Brooklyn. When you build more housing, prices rise. 

New Housing is usually going to be the most expensive housing in a given area.
Found the CHILD! 

Tell me you've never done a runoff analysis for a construction project. 

Or been stuck in traffic trying to get *to* that project. 

Yes. McMansions in the Pine Barrens. Usually designated senior housing. 

It doesn't bring your local prices down.
Obviously it would have to take into account any environmental factors should they exist.  But there are a ton of light industrial buildings and commercial properties that have little to no ground pollution that can be razed and replaced.

Not to mention if you let a building decay long enough it‚Äôs bound to become a hazard to the local population.
Yup. Think of it like this. You have a strip mall with 5 spaces available (for simplicity they're equally sized). You find 4 renters willing to pay $10k each but can't fill the last spot at that price. The theory is if you then rent the last space out for $7500, then when the first 4 leases come up, they'll demand lower rent (4 x $2500 = $10k). So its better to keep that last spot unleased and write off the ""loss"" for tax purposes then to risk having to lower the other rents.
go point us to the legislation that allows you to claim a loss for a vacant apt, we will wait
[deleted]
It‚Äôs 6%
no lol

your random uncle with one apt and an LLC to manage it is counted as a corporation in every one of these stats. that is what most of those SFH 'corps' are

by and large corps are not into SFH. Apts, condos, yes.
Please no
It‚Äôs rampant. Where do you think the ‚Äúnimby‚Äù narrative came from?

In my town there have been 3 or 4 apartment complex built with these PILOTS in place: And oh, how funny, 3 or 4 school bond referendums to keep up. The most recent was 90 million. That‚Äôs just this one; all together I think it‚Äôs like 200 million on the backs of taxpayers to expand the already crowded schools. 

But if you object? ‚ÄúShut up, NIMBY! You just don‚Äôt want poor kids in school with your little princes and princesses! Why do you hate poor people?‚Äù It‚Äôs infuriating.
No, the politicians that run the towns love them. It‚Äôs an important distinction. I don‚Äôt know a single resident that thinks they are beneficial or a good idea.

Edit: Aaaaand cue the downvote without a response. If you can give a single reason why a developer should be able to not pay taxes on a commercial property and shift the burden to homeowners, feel free to share with the rest of the class.
Yea I would be fine with two days. Just not the same two days for everyone. And also, force management to use that time for actual in person interaction instead of just trying to hear ourselves on headphones.
people absolutely made long term decisions in the wake of the pandemic. So many people bought and sold homes during that time.  That was a big reason prices jumped so much. People also changed career, and retired as a direct result of the pandemic and the changes it brought.  Those are long term decisions.

> It'll drive the prices there up but itll spread Americans out.

Yea and I'm saying making NJ homes cheaper at the cost of making more rural state homes more expensive isn't a good solution. It's a self centered one.
You're missing the point of what I'm saying, for most people their home value is the largest asset they own -- whether due to ignorance or financial illiteracy, whatever -- traditionally, Americans have been guided that their home will always appreciate in value (which is generally true).

Most people foolishly believe they can retire by downsizing at retirement and living off a 401k (if they're lucky) and/or social security. But that's their situation to sort out at the end of the day.

From what you've written, i interpret what you're talking about as wealth redistribution from the lower classes who've used housing as a tool for upward socioeconomic mobility.
houses aren‚Äôt priced on a whim they are priced based on how much a buyer is willing to pay
The idea that homes shouldn‚Äôt appreciate in value is incredibly naive. Maintenance, improvements, and inflation all drive costs up, and expecting homeowners to just eat those expenses indefinitely without building equity is unrealistic ‚Äî and frankly, a bit entitled.

Maybe ‚Äúfree money‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the words to use but it is passive income which is way better than working a physical labor 9-5.

Affordable housing is important, but freezing property values isn‚Äôt some magic fix ‚Äî it would just discourage investment and leave communities stuck with neglected, deteriorating homes.
uhhh, yea.  it is often impossible. the person you are renting to might be able to afford something like $800 a month but can't afford or get credit for a $400,000 sale or whatever.  and the seller can't pay off their mortgage if they sold the home for only $800 and not something closer to $400,000 or whatever market price is.
You clearly have never owned a small business that you solely ran on on your own.
Sounds like those in my western Monmouth town :(
> Towns fight affordable housing because it‚Äôll lower existing home values and racism.  

My town has been building housing meaningfully in the near decade I've been here. Streets are much less safe, traffic enforcement seems to be down, water pressure is lower, and my gut feeling is that fire engines are rolling more often, but I don't have data on that.  

I don't personally oppose housing, but it isn't lost on me that existing residents experience some meaningful degradation. Now, a proactive town should probably build sidewalks, bike lanes, and safer streets, but that money is going to come from residents.
Part of the problem with the affordable housing situation is that towns rebelled so hard that they didn‚Äôt start building any and now they are responsible for building at lot all at once when realistically their infrastructure cannot handle a huge increase in residents. Public schools, sewers, even roads can usually accommodate growth on a slower timetable, but many towns are at capacity and will have issues supplying services to large developments. It would have been much better if towns got over their selves and started slowly incorporating growth when I was mandated decades ago.
New housing didn‚Äôt cause high prices. High prices caused new housing.¬†

There is a significant amount of research that shows new housing helps lower rent in the area. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs market rate or subsidized.¬†

I guess where I'm skeptical is just the general trust of ensuring things would be squared away in the right way. I used to do a lot of cleanout stuff and there's tons of seemingly innocent places that look like a dream to make something of it, but then you find situations like the former industrial laundromat business was breaking up parts of the basement foundation and dumping chemicals in holes dug out and covering them up.  Also tons of places that still very much have asbestos in some way shape or form.
It's probably even simpler than that. The cost of the building monthly just needs to exceed what you are able to get people to agree to pay for it. You don't even need to have the least expiry or others on the plot. You can just say the property is worth 10K in taxes but I can only get people who are willing to pay $7,500 because the location's not great the building is old etc etc
Usually done for folks/companies who own several buildings but yeah preventing empty housing is in the interest of the municipality.
Right now they lower taxes if it's not rented out so we can just end that at least
Is that like currently or as purchased by. The problem isn‚Äôt that a corp owns a single family home and like rents it out. The problem is that they‚Äôll buy and then flip as a million dollar home. They are more able to offer all cash and out bid individual buyers. And generally they‚Äôll target lower cost homes in higher priced areas.
You want apartments to be built. Trust me. Not everyone specifically wants a single family home, they do want *a home*, however. Build enough alternative homes like apartments and townhouses and row homes and give people options, and suddenly the existing stock of single family homes have a lot less competition ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt used to have bidding wars on 70 year old 2br starter homes in lower middle class towns, they didn‚Äôt used to be unattainable for people in their 20‚Äôs and 30‚Äôs. The housing crisis is never gonna end by just building more single family homes in the most congested state in the country¬†
Ha, I have my theories. But it is real. You're not crazy nor in the wrong for thinking it's bullshit. I'm right there with you.
Pilots give more to the town but nothing to the school budget it seems like a scam to me also
Why not? Rural state homes need people. There are some towns and cities that will even give you free land. And that's just the US. Tons of places around the world that also are begging for immigrants. 

Want prices to go down? Ok. Two options. Lower demand or increase supply. My option does both. 

Otherwise you can find creative ways to increase supply in an already very dense state. Good luck.
No I understand what you are saying, I'm not trying to suggest it would be an easy or quick or simple transition to move away from the guidance that people should buy a home as a financial investment in the future. I'm not naive about that. But I think it's a difficult cultural transition we need to make.

> i interpret what you're talking about as wealth redistribution from the lower classes who've used housing as a tool for upward socioeconomic mobility

You'd be interpreting incorrectly.
Also based on what a seller is willing to take. I'm suggesting people be more willing to take a lower amount. They should consider not only what the buyer is willing to pay, but also who the buyer is. So many people saying make it illegal for companies to own single family residences, but if they are the ones offering the highest dollar or most convenient sales, would these same advocates take that offer? I'm suggesting they don't need to make it illegal to choose not to sell to them. They can intentionally choose to take a lower offer putting their beliefs over their profits.

But yea what you are getting at is what I'm saying needs to change. Dont make the amount sold for the most important thing to consider when selling the home.
> Maintenance, improvements, and inflation all drive costs up, and expecting homeowners to just eat those expenses indefinitely without building equity is unrealistic ‚Äî and frankly, a bit entitled.

Lol, I'm saying people SHOULDN'T feel entitled to anything. You are the one saying people should feel entitled to an appreciated value. But I mean there are many other products where we expect to just eat those costs indefinitely and not have an appreciated value to show for it. Motor vehicle ownership, home appliances, more often than not that's how it works with the things we own. As they age and deteriorate, they become less valuable. 

>Affordable housing is important, but freezing property values isn‚Äôt some magic fix 

I didn't suggest freezing housing values.

>it would just discourage investment and leave communities stuck with neglected, deteriorating homes.

I don't think it would. People would still have sufficient motivation to maintain the homes they live in. People don't want to live in run down shacks.
And you think the market price will stay the same if no one can afford it?
Ah I guess. Pretty obvious people are getting exploited and something has to change
Wrong, nerd! 

There is zero reasearch that says Brooklyn rents are cheaper than they used to be.

""More density"" = new construction = higher prices per unit. 

""just build"" = senior & luxury housing = higher prices per unit.

You're a homebuyer not a non-profit property Developer!

That‚Äôs a defeatist attitude. It‚Äôs never gonna end‚Ä¶so let‚Äôs make it worse by not building homes. Wtf
Well I‚Äôm being downvoted so I‚Äôve obviously pissed in someone‚Äôs cheerios, lol.
It is a scam. A lucrative one. Every time one of these conversations pops up on Reddit they get flooded by a bunch of randoms who seem to think building skyscrapers in fucking Middletown is ‚Äúthe only answer‚Äù and I get downvoted to oblivion for pointing out that PiLOTS are nothing but a grift by developers and politicians but strangely enough nobody can ever provide me with a clear response as to why this is not the case.
Many rural state homes don't need more people competing, the local market is sufficient to find a buyer. These are also rarely the places people wealthy enough to already have a home in the dense places want to move to.  I'm referring to places where home prices are skyrocketing.  the places offering incentives to move there usually aren't the places remote workers have been moving to.

Also I absolutely don't think the solution should be encourage people to emigrate abroad. If that isn't your suggestion, I don't know why you are bringing international homes into the conversation.
Functionally, I get where you're coming from, but the reality is that housing as an investment is generally true for most people. It is hard to break a perception when the reality foots with expectations. Factor in sentimental nature of homes, sunk cost fallacy, ever other thing under the sun -- that's one hell of an upward battle that'd take 50 years to move away from
good luck convincing sellers and realtors and everyone else involved taking less money. 
So the person who‚Äôs willing to take on a PoS house and restore it, clean it up and upgrade it isn‚Äôt allowed to recoup the money and time he/she put into the property? 
i mean a better way to approach it is transparency. It should be disclosed who‚Äôs using the house as a primary residence
You‚Äôre contradicting yourself. First, you say people *shouldn‚Äôt* feel entitled to anything, yet you‚Äôre the one suggesting homeowners should just accept ongoing expenses with no return on investment ‚Äî as if they‚Äôre obligated to lose money. That‚Äôs not rejecting entitlement; that‚Äôs just shifting the burden onto homeowners.  

And comparing homes to cars or appliances is a weak argument. Those are consumable goods ‚Äî they‚Äôre designed to wear out. Homes are fundamentally different; they‚Äôre long-term investments that require upkeep to maintain value and livability. Pretending they should follow the same rules is just oversimplifying the issue.  

As for affordable housing, if you‚Äôre not suggesting freezing property values, what exactly *are* you suggesting? Because without value growth, homeowners have little incentive to improve or maintain their properties. Sure, people don‚Äôt *want* to live in rundown homes, but plenty of people neglect maintenance when there‚Äôs no financial reason to care. Wishful thinking doesn‚Äôt change that.
No, but I think someone will be able to afford it. Do you think nobody will be able to afford a home some time soon? If nobody else, I think corporations will
>¬†There is zero reasearch that says Brooklyn rents are cheaper than they used to be.

Now imagine how expensive it would be if they built nothing.

I‚Äôm sorry you dislike empirical evidence because it conflicts with your feelings.¬†
This is a good report. I really wish it broke it down by housing type - you can infer that a lot are multi family housing because Hudson and Camden counties are at the top. MFH tends to be owned by a company rather than an individual due to the cost required to invest in it.¬†

Also interesting to note that a lot of the shore counties are on here. The report says that institutional homeownership is 2x the state average so I‚Äôm guessing those are primarily vacation rentals.¬†
You're misreading. We need to build homes, but we need more dense structures than single family houses. Build more apartment complexes, build vertically, centralize a lot of residents right near a town center in walking distance of the places they need to shop and work at. That would truly be more affordable housing.
Reading comprehension at an all time low
Yup I was reading the local Asbury Park paper the other day and its just a money grab for the town they even mention the kids lol. I think we need more affordable housing but we need to do it the right way. And I'm sure the fair tax value should be much higher than the PILOT they are proposing ( its a 6 house proposal or a 90 apartment proposal being debated) .

""The total taxes for these houses would be $278,000 a year,‚Äù she said of the six-home tax structure. ‚ÄúThe city would get $95,000 a year, and the school would get $140K.

So with a PILOT, the city would get $313,000 a year toward taxes, way more than the 95‚Ä¶ and we would have 18 affordable units, which would provide housing for families who send their kids to the Asbury Park School District.‚Äù

Lol ok what's your idea to bring home prices down?
>i mean a better way to approach it is transparency. It should be disclosed who‚Äôs using the house as a primary residence

Isn't that already done.  I'm less familiar with NJ laws but the other state I'm familiar with, that's required with every sale.  But what effect would that sort of transparency have on home values?  You seem to think (and I would agree) people don't consider the buyer's use when deciding on a selling price. The reason that is disclosed is for tax purposes.

> So the person who‚Äôs willing to take on a PoS house and restore it, clean it up and upgrade it isn‚Äôt allowed to recoup the money and time he/she put into the property?

Sure they are allowed to, I'm not suggesting they shouldn't be.  I'm saying the people selling to them should consider their offer in relation to offers from people who want to live in the home and maybe consider that as a factor in deciding which offer to accept. Not just who's offering the most money/easiest closing deal.
>You‚Äôre contradicting yourself. First, you say people shouldn‚Äôt feel entitled to anything, yet you‚Äôre the one suggesting homeowners should just accept ongoing expenses with no return on investment ‚Äî as if they‚Äôre obligated to lose money

I'm not sure what contradicting you are pointing out. What am I claiming people are entitled to?

>As for affordable housing, if you‚Äôre not suggesting freezing property values, what exactly are you suggesting? 

People not treat homes as financial investments.

>Sure, people don‚Äôt want to live in rundown homes, but plenty of people neglect maintenance when there‚Äôs no financial reason to care. Wishful thinking doesn‚Äôt change that.

Sure sime people do neglect homes, but that still happens currently. That wouldn't be a new phenomenon. You also act like flippers, purely resale profit motive people would do a good job of it. People living there long term, even until they die have more reason to invest in a house than someone planning on selling it.
Why would a corporation buy it if they can't rent it?
You mean the 1980's? Things were rather cheap. 

When I lived in NY, Jay-Z was tearing down 10,000 homes to build the Nets stadium.

All those Luxury developments along the water & Flatbush were vacant.

My neighbors were evicted. The apartment sat vacant for months. 

Tell me what ""evidence"" you're referring to?
You‚Äôre saying an apartment is a home. It‚Äôs not.
Yes, they conveniently leave out the fact that 90 apartments would absolutely significantly increase school enrollment, but since none of the money would go towards the school budget it will inevitably increase property taxes for everyone else. And that‚Äôs just one apartment complex. In order to meet the guidelines being set for affordable housing that number will only go up. 

So of course the people who just want cheap apartments in their very specific desired locations think this is great, and those of us who actually own our homes continue to bear the brunt, but are the assholes if we dare suggest that the corporations building and profiting off of these ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù homes shoulder a bit of the tax burden.
you can see my root comment to OP for my take
your original comment is implying that every seller should take not the highest bid and it should be OK to lose money on a house and sell for less than you bought. I absolutely know zero people that would do that. Seller should do whatever they want with whatever information they have. Seller should not be mandated to do what you are suggesting.
Fair enough, kinda loosing track of the hypothetical you presented. Still, even discounting them, i think someone would be able to afford a home.  The population is generally always growing and even if it doesn't, there is always outsider populations that would be willing to move in for the right price.  People would be willing to buy a second home at the right price.  I don't think a teenager getting kicked out the house at 18 with little to no job experience and no credit will be able to compete with others like I just mentioned.  If you are living paycheck to paycheck, do you think people like this would ever be able to afford a home that's not a rental? even if renting was illegal?
No you‚Äôre not understanding my point.¬†

How expensive do you think it would be if they built nothing? Do you think it would somehow be cheaper if there was less housing in Brooklyn?
That is the stupidest NIMBY shit I‚Äôve ever heard, wow that is IMPRESSIVE. I guess all 9 million residents of NYC are homeless and so are like 3/4 of Hudson County. Tragic!¬†
Man you made me go search for that atrocious idea? Make people ok with losing value on a home lol. What a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation. 

Sellers don't set the prices of homes. Buyers do. Go ahead and list a home less than what you bought it for. Then watch as hundreds of offers come in and send you bids for over asking to the point you end up selling for the price you should have listed originally.
>your original comment is implying that every seller should take not the highest bid and it should be OK to lose money on a house and sell for less than you bought.

I wasn't implying every seller shouldn't take the highest bid, but I was trying to get at more than simply the bid amount should be considered.

> I absolutely know zero people that would do that.

Sure, and we have a cost of housing crisis. We can't keep doing things the same and expect home prices to somehow be lower. I realize what I'm suggesting is a big cultural change.  I think that's what is needed.  

>Seller should do whatever they want with whatever information they have. Seller should not be mandated to do what you are suggesting.

I didn't advocate for any mandates. I'm suggesting what people should do and consider when buying and selling.  I offered a suggestion for how to make housing more affordable.  If people care about making housing affordable, don't prioritize selling housing for as much as possible. if people choose to sell for as much as possible, don't bitch about expensive housing when you are part of the problem. If you lament expensive housing as a non-owner then suddenly just care about increasing your value when you finally become an owner, your ""fuck you, i got mine"" attitude is part of the problem.
I think it is the duty of the government to provide shelter, food, water and opportunity. Otherwise they will be a drain on society with crime then we will pay more to keep them in prison for their life. I am not saying anything nice just enough take advantage of an opportunity.
Housing cost is a function of median income, not demand. 

When the built the luxury towers in Downtown Brooklyn they sat empty because people didn't have the *income* to live there, but there were plenty of homeless. 

So I used 1980's Brooklyn as an example. Full capacity, but lower incomes = lower costs. 

But you could also you Center City, Philadelphia. Or Newark until the last 5 years. Queens until the last ten. These places all had almost 0% vacancy. And cheaper than Brooklyn.

So, sure. Jersey should not build NYCHA buildings. But also we cannot build only luxury housing. Because all we'll do is compete for those Brooklyn trust funders. The same number of normal Jersey residents will still need housing, and we didn't build it. 

""supply and demand"" is so fucking shallow. The world doesn't exist in a vacuum. Peope migrate & economies shift. 

We need more housing for the income levels experiencing housing shortages. 

Not ""build everything everywhere"". We've been doing that since my Grandfather bought his first house.
Apartments are where you live when you can‚Äôt afford a home or are so rich you don‚Äôt give a fuck.

Mind boggling that you are justifying underbuilding and high demand with ‚Äújust get an apartment‚Äù Out of touch
Lol no, sellers do. Buyers choose to but it or not. They are the ones creating the real estate listing, not buyers.  sellers accept the offers, buyers make bids.  buyers only set the price in practical terms when your only concern is to sell for as much of a profit as you can. I understand the fundamentals of the situation and I'm saying the fundamentals should be changed. If I sell my home, I'd turn down offers from people who don't intend to live in the home. I'd be setting the price and the price includes living in the home, they don't get to dictate that price to me.
best of luck to you
okay, but why not have the government provide shelter and allow rentals if people do want something nice? And you kinda left off the part about the government providing shelter to everyone with your initial suggestion.

Also who will be a drain on society when you say ""they""?
>Housing cost is a function of median income, not demand.

This is so wildly wrong I cannot even begin to explain the issues with it.
And you‚Äôre a teacher?! No wonder kids can‚Äôt read anymore. I can‚Äôt keep replying to someone who can‚Äôt comprehend a simple paragraph. Have a great day, I‚Äôm out.¬†
Shit why stop there? Sell the home for a can of soda. That'll fix the problem with housing in NJ now that you gave your house away for a can of Pepsi. 

If a home is worth 500k based on comparable listings and the seller puts 400k, they will get bids for 500k plus. Real estate agents are actually doing this right now and pricing homes under their value to cause bidding wars. Sure the seller can say no to the 500k bids and accept the 400k. But then they will sell the home in 6 months for a quick profit. If it helps, every bid will pinky promise they will live in the home though. They have no legal obligation to listen to you though.
don't wish me luck, wish people trying to buy a home in NJ luck
Its common sense. 

Finance bros have convinced your generation that ""supply & demand"" requires ""supply side economics"" to justify deregulation.

Its sad. 

When you mistake ""build the kind of housing people can afford"" for ""never build anything anywhere"". 

NJ needs more starter homes. More apartments. Less senior housing. Less McMansions.

The Developers & Financers arguing against this are using supply side economics to justify deregulation. They are not advocating policies which will lower rents. They make money off of high rents & convincing you to allow them to build McMansions & Luxury Senior Housing in your town. Thats where the profit is. Building more of the same suburbia.
>If it helps, every bid will pinky promise they will live in the home though

You do realize a home sale involves a contract, right? Why pinky promise when you can write it into the contract? Your suggestions are intentionally obtuse and insincere. They will have a contractual obligation to not sell the home for a specified amount of time.
It's a waste of time. Buyers that want to live there won't sell for a few years anyway to get around taxes. And buyers that don't plan to keep it, will just rent it a few years.
>Buyers that want to live there won't sell for a few years anyway to get around taxes

Good, that means I sold to someone who intends to live there for a few years and not a flipper or a landlord intending to rent it.

>And buyers that don't plan to keep it, will just rent it a few years.

Like i said, I'd sell to people who intend to live there and prohibit use as a rental in the contract.
Lol good luck. You would sell for tons under value and for what? You haven't changed a thing.
Why do you assume I'd be selling for tons under value and not only a little under value or at value? We don't know who would be bidding in the hypothetical sale.  I would be changing the opportunity for the home buyers placing bids on my home, that's certainly something.
Because your demands arent normal and would scare away buyers. No one wants to work with a seller like that.
You don't think I would find a buyer, who would be buying a home for tons under value as you expect, that would be willing to commit to living there for a minimum of a few years? Shit, i'd do that for a home tons under value.
You would. But for under the value of your home. Why? I don't know. Makes no sense .
Okay, so you agree, there are people who would be willing to work with a seller like me.

>Why? I don't know. Makes no sense

I just explained why I would do it, to do my part to make homes affordable for people that need a home to live in. To push back against a culture that perpetuates ever increasing home values. And buyers would be willing to work with a seller like me because they can get a home that is more affordable. I understand if you wouldn't buy or sell like this, but i don't see what you are having trouble understanding about the rational for either myself or a buyer in this situation.
I don‚Äôt buy a word of her BS. You shouldn‚Äôt either she sounds utterly insane. It‚Äôs nonsense, every bit of it.
It's like cutting off your arm to protect against global warming. It makes no sense that you are punishing yourself to give one person out of millions a good deal on a home. It doesn't change anything. When your neighbor goes to sell their home, the agent will just ignore your sale when deciding on what price to sell the neighbors home at. 

The thread is looking at ways to fix the issue on a large scale. You are looking at ways to fix it on one sale. Lol.
It's not at all like mutilating yourself for global warming.  It's like giving up some money for global warming.  People Give up money and donate to charities all the time in the name of fighting global warming. Are you against people donating money to charity to improve problems with the world? Why not let people do that if they choose to do so? What part of giving up some profits is like dismembering yourself?

I'm suggesting we need a cultural change, I'm talking a very large scale solution. I'd understand if you are criticizing it for being too large scale and ambitious rather than too small scale.  Not just me adopting this philosophy, i'm saying everyone should and we should set up systems to encourage others to do this.
There is no system. No process. At best you can spread the word to everyone to do it and everyone would just ignore you because why would they agree to losing money? Even if everyone agreed to just taking 100k off all homes, demand goes up. There would still be no homes. There would still be a housing crisis.
Right, I'm saying we need to come up with a system and a process.  You don't seem to understand my initial suggestion. spreading the word isn't the best we can do.  For example we can have the government offer more support for people in retirement so that people retiring are less reliant on the money a house sale or rental generates. I'm not suggesting everyone simply agrees to take $X off all home sales. that's something you just suggested.  Again, it feels like you forgot what I suggested. i am suggesting we transition away from counting on home ownership as a financial investment for the future. I'm suggesting we try to be more okay with not selling a home for a profit. The laws of supply and demand are only applicable if we assume people are trying to maximize the amount they sell a product for.  You also are overlooking the other way to achieve that without selling at a reduced profit or loss.  you can also just not sell the house and continue to live in the one you are at.  before you try to mention that reduces supply, it also reduces demand by an equal amount. people don't sell their homes and decide to be homeless.
I can't keep spending my day explaining this. So much wrong. So little grasp of the problem.
we can both understand the problem adequately, and feel different solutions are best. I'm not sure why you think I don't understand the problem."

My suggestion is to drop the Advantage plan and go straight Medicare Part A&B along with a Supplement. It cost more but you have better coverage.
Submit an appeal to UHC.
If your doctor opted out of Medicare and your plan does not have out of network benefits, you‚Äôre SOL.   
  
Any health insurer can only include in their networks doctors/hospitals that are eligible to participate and, since your doctor is not eligible to participate in Medicare you are not able to get Medicare coverage for him.
If he doesn't take Medicare then they won't cover it. Not sure why you thought different? Its like any other health insurance. You have to go in network.
Doesn‚Äôt help OP because the doctor opted out of Medicare. Plus OP can‚Äôt change until open enrollment at the end of the year unless the government grants him a special enrollment period. That doesn‚Äôt apply here.
I don‚Äôt know of any doctors that don‚Äôt take straight Medicare, I know many do not participate in any of those Advantage plans because they pay Pennie‚Äôs.
OP said their doctor opted out. It‚Äôs not unheard of though only a small number have done so and most have thriving practices where wealthy patients pay cash. Orthopedics is a field where good doctors can pick and choose. But, none of this changes what OP said unless they come back and say they were wrong."
Strange sound Red Bank NJ 4:30-6:00am Monday March 24th.,"I woke up at roughly 4:45am to what I thought was a delivery truck idling outside my bedroom window. I checked outside and saw nothing. I live close to a firehouse, thought maybe they were gearing up the trucks. But it was silent and no trucks in sight. I heard my neighbors walking upstairs, so I figured maybe they heard it too, or perhaps got a new appliance that was causing the noise. ‚ÄòTwas no such appliance. They were up because they heard it and thought it was coming from our apartment downstairs. It was one of that sounds that no matter how loudly you play rain sounds, or put a pillow over your head, the sound cuts right through.

NJ Map of Average Household Carbon Emissions,"Blue is less, red is more. Apartments apparently save a lot of energy.",0.83,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jisjtd/nj_map_of_average_household_carbon_emissions/,130,1jisjtd,2025-03-24 14:54,"You could overlay where are the wealthy areas of the state and come up with an identical map.¬†
I guess it should basically be no surprise at all that Colts Neck, Holmdel, and Millstone Township are the 3 worst in Monmouth County.
Apartments with lower floorspace is less than half the equation. [Transportation is 37% of energy consumption](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/) in the US, compared to residential uses (lighting and climate control) being 15% and commercial being 13%. 

One good way to think about this is the Ford F-150 Lightning's advertised ability to power your house off the grid for 3 days. This is the amount of energy in the battery required to move the truck 300 miles, which means the average house consumes about as much energy per day as a F-150 Lightning will burn in 100 miles. The amount of energy burned by a ICE car is similar (actually slightly less because the engine and fuel is lighter than a battery).

Of course density means less spent on transportation because everything is physically closer, converting car trips to walks or public transit rides.
Urban density is energy efficient. They require less energy per housing unit and people also burn less fossil fuels because they can get more places by foot or transit.
From this cool org: [https://coolclimate.org/](https://coolclimate.org/)
Wouldn't it be nice if houses were small, more efficient, and affordable?
Some kind of county overlay would be nice.
What is white? No data?
Larger houses, plus don't forget about things like wood burning fireplaces.¬†


You can see part of Western Connecticut and there are red areas that are less densely populated but a lot of the houses up there have fireplaces that are used all winter long. I've heard of them actually having nighttime air quality warnings a few times over the years due to wood smoke.¬†


There are families in my neighborhood with fireplaces who use them at night much of the winter and it's very common for my neighborhood to smell smokey at night.¬†
I knew Bridgewater was bad for everyone...
It would be a lot less if we had trains going the length of 287, 80 etc. Not everyone is travelling to NYC, Newark, or Trenton. Or at least have a bus route that connects the NJ Transit terminal nodes.
Post a link to the source or this is just some gpt bullshit
This is honestly so surprising. I would have guessed the more rural areas would be clean! I'm curious to see a breakdown by use, because I'm also guessing the carbon emissions is brought by the reliance on cars üßê

I'd bet the blue has more to do with higher retired populations when you get to South Jersey. If you don't have anywhere to be, you don't go.
Heard in NJ: OH NO THEY FOUND US. Time to move!
this has very little to do with housing size.  This map mainly represents work commutes and you omitted the study data.

blue areas are all job centers or vacation/retirement homes that don't have commutes (jersey shore/upstate).
It's interesting that Teterboro is low. 


I guess airplanes don't count
This map is interesting but there‚Äôs so much data missing.
Overlay it with the towns/counties heavily voting MAGA and you'd probably.....NOT be surprised by the results.
The blue areas also seem to be locations where there's access to things like better public transportation.
That doesn't track. Look at Manhattan and NYC. It has more to do with density. Heating and cooling is much more expensive for single family homes.
I'd give it like a 70% correlation.

https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Income_by_Location_in_New_Jersey.png
More likely density. Urban areas can more efficiently deliver utilities to households and make trips without personal gas vehicles. Additionally, multi family homes are more efficient to keep heated since the units insulate each other from the outside.
It's not quite the same. The biggest factors are housing types (apartments good, houses bad) and transportation (transit good, cars bad).
It has to do more with how walkable the area is! Rich towns like Summit, Morristown and even Montclair are not blue. But areas with good walkability and public transit are (e.g, Newark, Jersey City). To be fair tho, living in the most walkable and transit rich areas of the state will do cost you a fortune lol.
ah yes the notoriously broke ghettos of bergen county, manhattan, and cape may are bright blue here
It doesn't work. I did a couple of spot checks and it doesn't line up.
Who do you think lives in the top right of the map?
BP created the term ‚Äúcarbon footprint‚Äù to pass the responsibility of emissions to consumers as opposed to actually trying to fix anything

Transportation is a big part of it too. But it can't just be electricity. You have to include heating with gas and oil. NJ has real winters unlike the West or the South.

Household emissions. *Household*.
I also don't like the choice of colors. Seems like it's intentionally made to be political.
reddit moment!
Exactly. When I lived in Hudson county I barely used my car because I could either walk, take a bus or use the light rail to get around.
I am suspicious there is some weirdness in this graph.  While there is public transportation in those areas, there is also ridiculous traffic in those areas.  I wonder how exactly they calculated these values.

It may really be ""less emissions per person"" but not necessarily less emissions overall.
In Salem county?
They have better transportation options.¬†
Income does not mean generational wealth. Income means new money.¬†
Summit outside of the small downtown is not walkable.. many residential streets have no sidewalks¬†

Energy isn't just electricity, energy is everything from gasoline used to fill up cars, natural gas used to heat homes, and includes electricity used in everything from cooking to lighting. Energy is the catch all for every time humans make something move which was previously stationary, or heat something up which was previously cold.
Only if LOTS of open space was preserved for all to enjoy (and for animals to live) and not completely filled in with more houses stacked on top of each other.
Little boxes on the hillside... Little boxes made of ticky-tacky... Little boxes on the hillside... Little boxes all the same...
Perhaps or not.  Yes, on access to public trans.  Maybe less urban environments is what we need.  Maybe more urban for some.
Totally agree.
No shit. I was referring to the 3 areas around ""central"" jersey...one of which has an orange dot in it.
That makes sense. Thanks
Them and Edison (at least the southern portion) seem ok. Might be all the solar panels in Edison, idk
close enough
I think it's just an interesting side effect of where the borough boundaries are. Teterboro has several giant sources of emissions ( the airport, the 2 big box stores, the accompanying strip of smaller businesses), but literally 71 people live in it (as of 2023).
Even so, it's probably misleading because of the density of housing.  I suspect those areas still generate more house emissions overall, just not more per household.
I get it. I guess I'm saying that using Household as a metric doesn't really make sense when you have communities that are almost entirely Walmart, Costco, and the airport
I think it's meant to be red-green colorblind friendly.
I don‚Äôt mind the colors, it‚Äôs basically a heat map. But what are emissions being compared to? My house, for example, runs a high electricity bill but we don‚Äôt use any combustibles. We‚Äôre 100% electric, cars included, therefore we‚Äôre more *efficient* than a similar home running gas heat and two gas vehicles.
Explain? Not sure i understand.
It's per capita.
It‚Äôs emissions per capita. Which matters MUCH more than total emissions.
Agree. Ft Lee has lots of GWB vehicle traffic and higher density, so it shows up as blue while Englewood Cliffs and Alpine, both low density and moderate vehicle traffic areas, shows up as deep red.
My assumption there, is the parts closer to the city yes, public transport. The parts more south are are just not as densely populated as the rest of NJ. Same for Cape May, it's been a minute since I looked at the details but they are both usually dead last in population of all NJ Counties usually by a large margin. Like everywhere else is well into 6 six figures while those are both under 100K
All the more its not about wealth.
Income also means new money earned off old wealth (interest, dividends, rental income, fees, etc.).

The better measurement may be Net Worth excluding Home Equity.
Cape May?
It's also just commuting. Those dark red towns in Monmouth County have a lot of people that commute to those blue areas, while the people that live in the blue areas are already where they work, meaning even if they do drive they drive less. The traffic is so bad in those urban blue areas because of all the people driving in from the more rural or less dense red areas.
yeah all the jersey shore and upstate NY has great transportation
The fact they changed that song, instead of leaving it alone over the life of the show, was criminal
the map very clearly illustrates we need more urban environments (w/r/t co2/ghg emissions)
I think those are just very pale blues and reds
Inland seas s/
Yeah, I take issue with Hillsborough being that low. It's a driving town.
Its the sea man
That would make its emissions show as very high, not low
The comment I replied to mentioned airplanes. Airplanes are not household items.
You may be more efficient than your gas/oil neighbor, but if you live in a suburb, you‚Äôre not ever going to be truly efficient. The (environmental) costs of getting goods from cities to suburbs are significant and, if isolated in a vacuum, single-handedly erase the gains you‚Äôve made by switching to electric cars. 

But yes, switching to electric is good since you‚Äôre already there (sunk cost fallacy).
But are you. The emissions aren't coming out of you pipes, but all that electricity is powered by something. If you think it's all solar and wind power. Well you should look into things a little deeper.
he's saying you're too dumb to understand the map lol
OK, so we should definitely develop the rest of the state to be urban and industrial like those blue zones around New York and Philadelphia.   Who knew plowing down the environment could help the environment.
That's because per capita, Ft. Lee probably has less cars to people. Why? Public transportation is way more convenient. Or if they did have a car they most likely have a shorter commute to their job. Yes, Ft Lee is loaded with cars crossing the GWB or taking the Turnpike daily, but they mostly aren't all originating from Ft. Lee. They are commuting from counties further out and therefore the carbon footprint gets associated with that county in which the vehicle originates. A car travelling further spits out more emissions during an hour commute than it would for a 30 minute one. So distance plays a part as well.

You are incorrectly conflating this map with traffic.
Lots of biking and walking¬†
this person is a moron haha.
Far hills, Bedminster, basking ridge all have deeded open space like upstate NY. So it has to be something else.
No problem.  I would build it if I could.
If the boroughs added in the emissions of businesses, yes. It would be misleading, in a worse way, if it were calculated per household with the added emissions.

I'm saying that the *total* emissions of a given borough would be a better indicator of what is actually being produced
Man those goal posts are really getting their steps in.
I‚Äôm not ignorant to how we generate our electricity. But yes, I‚Äôm way more efficient than a home burning oil/gas.
Oh, I see. Well, he should have just said that instead of making an asinine, vague, passive-aggressive statement that could have been interpreted no fewer than 20 different ways all whilst hiding behind his ill-perceived internet anonymity.
Few different things at play here   
1) The simple math of 30 people on a single bus are going to toss way less pollution into the air than the 30 of them in their own cars. Even less if they can easily walk somewhere.   
2) The high traffic we associate with those areas are tied mostly to the entrance/exit into places like the city or large venues. People from more than just that one county are contributing to that traffic.    
3) Yes suburban sprawl and the idea of suburbia absolutely can cause more emissions if every person is forced to drive to get groceries/doctor/etc. all the time.   
  
Cities are pretty efficient given how many people live in them. But the argument doesn't need to be ""knock everything over and put up large skyscrapers"" but rather re-imagine the suburbs so they are not based on the car and from the perspective of them being easier/better public transport, more walkable/bikeable communities, invest in local businesses, etc.
Yes. You are correct. Everyone SHOULD live in cities. The suburbs are what plowed down the environment. Cities are EXTREMELY more efficient and significantly more environmentally friendly because they take up less space (less driving, shorter delivery distances, lower energy waste)‚Ä¶ this is common sense.
it's work commutes.  

Blue is either job center, very close to one like bergen county, or areas with lots of vacation homes and retired people not commuting like the jersey shore.  Red = far commute, which is why it's all over the more far flung burbs and rural areas that don't have many jobs locally.
It needs to be per capita or household to show any significant differences between boroughs, and represent the actual lifestyle of the residents in that area, regardless of (ignoring) what businesses are or are not located there. 

That way, if the people of Teterboro use private jets, it‚Äôll show up in calculation from their lifestyle, and if they don‚Äôt then it won‚Äôt, which is a fair representation of their actual carbon footprint. The private jet carbon footprint should be attributed to wherever the private jet users live.
nah, it was a good response to a stupid comment
Just another minor point to add to this but fewer people driving means less space allocated to parking lots. Parking lots are so incredibly wasteful and not only make areas much uglier but also contribute to flooding and decline in animal populations. Even during peak parking times in the past such as Black Friday most of these large lots would not fill to capacity, nevermind today with online shopping reducing traffic even more.

Additionally fewer vehicles means less dedicated space to vehicles on housing lots. Less space for garages and driveways means more space for living. It's obviously not feasible for all people in all families but even a home with a garage and driveaway reducing dedicated capacity to one vehicle means keeping one in the driveway and turning the garage into another room, be it a bedroom or workshop or rec room or just storage so you're not living on top of each other's junk.
work location is by far the biggest determining factor for this map. most people dont have 45m-1hr commutes for groceries nor go 5 days a week for groceries, they do for work

the biggest job centers are typically in or very near urban centers, that explains this thing to a t.  That is way more of a carbon hit than housing, groceries, etc.

if housing size or groceries were a major factor, a lot more of the $$ burbs in bergen or hudson would be red.
...lawns to mow, gardens to till, dead trees to cut up, driveways to plow. I'd also wonder if farms count towards this. Lots of family's with farms in those red areas, and plowing fields and harvesting uses a lot of fuel. Best to just pave paradise.
No. It wouldn't. 71 people+ private plane emissions is more than, say, 1,000 people with no planes.

I'm not sure how you could capture lifestyle in a per household no business map anyway. People live their lives inside and outside of where their actual boroughs are.

And the fact that Teterboro is almost entirely business *does* reflect lifestyle. Somebody had to vote to keep the public transit connections crappy, give permits to the businesses, build another business instead of housing when one is knocked down, etc.

The existing map *sort of* correlates with density, (Hudson County looks fairly blue) but misses where a lot of the emissions are actually coming from, which makes the map a lot less useful if we want to track emissions across the state.

Edit:  the above comment originally began (paraphrasing) ""an emission map would just be a population map."" That's why my comment starts ""No. It wouldn't.""
I could see farms skewing the data a bit, particularly ones with cattle/livestock.
You capture lifestyle by polling people about their lifestyle. That‚Äôs how these studies are done."

Used to be Wawa. But not anymore.
Quick check has real iced coffee, better coffee, better breakfast and they put the tomatoes IN the sub.
As someone who has lived/worked in both scenarios, and now lives right around the part where it changes from Wawa to QuickChek (Somerset County), I can definitively say that Wawa is far superior. And it's not even close.
Quick Chek is better and they're a NJ based company.
Quick check 150% !!! Wawa fell off
Well the wawa by me is always crowded, chaotic, and the food gave me food poisoning twice. Also the sandwiches are small. The QuickChek up the street is way better and if it is busy theyre able to complete your order pretty fast
Wawa is where you go to grab a halfway-decent wrap or sandwich, mainly coffee, and feel like a civilized person. QuickChek is where you go to shoot heroin in the bathroom. Both serve very important roles imo.
Ha! I was just having this conversation yesterday after a day trip to middle Jersey. Wawa is my preference bc it‚Äôs not my norm as we're in the north (and those pretzels, which also came up in conversation bc not everyone in my family understands my enjoyment of them lol) but my brother made a good point: QuickChek gives you free red peppers on a sandy, but Wawa gives you free jalapenos. So there you go.¬†

They're both corporate trash

None, honestly.  Look for a family owned place that has quality food.

Only thing I like at Wawa are the fresh pretzels. ü•® 
I‚Äôm a QuickChek lifer, since I grew up in a town that had two locations.
Wawa used to be WAY better, but as they've expanded their quality has gone down a ton.

So today if you want a low quality sandwich thrown together by somebody who ran out of fucks to give *years* ago, I don't think it really matters which spot you go to.
Wawa¬†
I went to a QuickChek once and my card was skimmed. Obviously that could happen at Wawa, but that definitely soured me on QuickChek.
wawa is better but not enough for me to drive the extra 5 minutes lol
Wawa everyday and twice on Sundays
Depends on what you want. I'd rather have breakfast at QC, except for the taylor ham/pork roll on a bagel. If I'm getting lunch, most of the time Wawa wins that. Snacks go both ways. Sometimes I want Wawa mozzarella sticks, sometimes I want chicken fingers from QC.
Wawa has gotten considerably worse over the last decade. I used to work there for 9 years and opening those bags of deli meats and the smell that would come out was not what you'd want deli meat to smell like. Just whatever chemicals they use to preserve that stuff in a plastic baggy, sometimes you'd get a nice chlorine-esque whiff. Plus the QC across nearly every store I was at (moved on from being an associate to helping open stores) plummeted. Mostly stemming from associates and a good chunk of managers just not giving a shit. 

I don't have anything to say against Quick Check since I never worked at one and only buy small stuff like snacks when I want something fast.
I think WaWa is better but there are more QuickChecks near me so that is where I tend to go. QuickCheck has a better rewards program because you get rewards on gas that you can use in the store. Last I got gas at WaWa, they don't do that.

WaWa sandwiches are better. They have a fountain soda dream machine. QuickCheck soup options are better.
I used to be a quickchek girlie back in the day but Wawa has won be over in recent years
Wawa has better coffee
Quickchek has better breakfast sandwiches
Wawa fo sho
Wawa overall. 

However, if I want a quick cup of soup for lunch, Quick Chek is the superior option.
Wawa without a doubt
whatever is closer for me - they both offer similar things with a few differences.

I have quickchek steps from my house and Wawa 5 min drive from my house. I go to quickchek 99% of the time and will go to Wawa when its on the way to/from home.
Wawa !!!!!!!
I'm a fan of chicken parm subs. Last couple years both wawa and quick chek have been taking it off and on the menu. Quick chek wins purely from not stuffing the fucking wrapper into the sandwich. Wawa stuffs it straight into the sandwich and every time I open it all the cheese comes with it. It's the dumbest way to wrap a sandwich.
Wawa.   Hands down.
*Definitely* Wawa.
I think it varies between each individual store. I used to work in the Holmdel/Keyport area and Quick chek & their sandwiches ruled in that area imo. I tried a WAWA around there at that time and wasn‚Äôt impressed. It was years later when I came back to the North Jersey area and now i feel the opposite is true. WAWA rules!
Quick check

Breakfast all day
Fresh bread/cookies all day cause they make it there
Wawa
Wawa, but even then -- my biggest gripe is that I can't order a BEC on a croissant.  I have to hope they have one in the warmer.  But those pierogi quesadillas... oof.  So good.
Between the 2, I pick quickcheck
I feel like Quickchek had it on lock for a few years, they just aren't the same anymore
Sheetz. I wish more were here.
Wawa, quickchek is fine but wawa is way better.
Honestly I didn‚Äôt know quickcheck was a chain. There was one near my hometown and it was like a temu 711. Not even on the same level as Wawa. Guess things have changed?
Wawa ‚Ä¶ their pepperoni and provolone melt on a bagel is the greatest
Wawa for sandwiches. QuickChek for coffee.
Wawa bread it too hard for me to enjoy. QuickChek has that soft bread I like.

Other than that, I probably wouldn't care which one I go to. Although I've noticed most QuichChek's I go to are pretty dead.
Taylor ham, as it's always been.
Both are good but honestly I choose wawa over quickchek because they do matcha lattes which are my favorite
After careful review of the comments, it looks like Wawa is the frontrunner.
Wawa. I grew up with only QuickCheks. Now have both. Wawa is infinitely better.
I've worked at both, I will never set foot in a quickchek again
Wawa has better grab and go options. I just went to QC  for free coffee Fridays. Then I find out in tiny print on the bottom it says ""must buy 1$ purchase""

Poor form QC.
[Randall voice] They both suck
I prefer Wawa, but QC is closer to my home with less traffic.
Wawa for sure
Wawa food is fucking disgusting I have no clue what‚Äôs wrong w you all eating it esp when we live in nj of all
Places. No excuse.
wawaaaaa
I like quickcheks sandwiches better because Wawa's have gotten lower in quality
No preference, both are good. We're just getting Wawas in North Jersey so it's a bit of a novelty still, but they are pretty much exactly the same imo.
PA immigrant, so Wawa for me. My driving skills have improved, before you say anything.
Wawa has the best food, and the only thing remotely close to here that can even be in the same discussion would be Sheetz (I don't know of any actually in NJ though). Sheetz has cleaner stores/ bathrooms and decent food, whereas Wawa stores are not always the cleanest but the food is better
WaWa no explanation needed
Both suck
Coffee bar - QC

Sandwich - Wawa
Wawa!
Wawa. It's not even close.
Wawa is more consistently ok, but a great QuickChek blows Wawa away. Unfortunately there are more shithole quick checks than there are wawas.  Though a lot of wawas are becoming pretty shit.

Quick Check has great soups and a larger selection of em. Wawa for everything else.
Wawa has better food that you order, but Quickchek has a larger variety of snacks.
First off I prefer Quikchek coffee but that's it. Generally Wawa stores are way cleaner. The food sucks at both but Wawa has a better game without a  doubt. Regardless I try not to go to either but a Wawa is nicer.
I wish both had more sugar free options. Quickchek has empanadas and Wawa has the best milkshakes.  Even with a restricted diet I‚Äôd say Wawa
Both are monthly budget killers. Avoid both.

But it really depends on the geography / region and what things you are looking for.
As a totally non-biased source I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a hit or miss. There are managers that really know how to make their workers not hate their fucking job and the clientele definitely plays a part in job happiness.
Bucee's is the supreme ruler but they don't like us up here. Wawa is the runner up and quikcheck is just looking in through the screen door...
i like getting gas at quick check lol but for everything else wawa is most definitely better
I love the Wawa pretzels. Reminds me of high school
wawa by a long shot quick checks cold cuts taste like they‚Äôre made out of deer ankles
Wawa and it‚Äôs not even a competition
The better one is whichever is closer when I'm hungry.
Wawa will always be king on sandwiches quick check always throws your sandwich together like a 4 yr old
WaWa 4E<3
Wawa.
Gross seeing all these people recommending wawa. Their food and coffee is garbage. Quick check has way better food. Their coffee also sucks though.
Wawa. Always cleaner, better organized, and their coffee and sandwiches are way better.
Wawa has given people food poisoning lol
Wawa overall but QuickChek for their Reese‚Äôs Cookies and Crumb Cake! My family went on a crumb cake kick for a while and we would try every local farm and family owned place.. I told them you gotta try QuickChek it‚Äôs so good and nobody gave a shit about my gas station recommendation. So I picked up 4 slices one night and shoved it in everyone‚Äôs face and they were all so surprised on how good it was!
Wawa frozen drinks and subs, soup. QC has grilled cheese and better breakfast sandwiches and coffee. IMO of course
Wawa is King.¬†
Call me crazy but I much prefer Quick check. The food is better and the clientele are less annoying/drunk during night runs.
Wawa! Egg n Cheese, and their Paninis late night ü´∂
Everything sucks now
Wawa for sandwiches but I used to love quick check salads also loved their wraps. Quick check has better coffee as well.
The bouncing souls wrote a song about quick check. They didn't write one about Wawa. All the answer I need to give
Wawa is so much better. i grew up around a quick chek and while i have to give props to the staff for staying up late and dealing with high and drunk teenagers, their food is so ass
Wawa for the win. Quick check is getting better quality lately, but the fact that to compete with Wawa, they started the ""crispy"" chicken sandwiches and they were the soggiest chicken i've ever eaten (from multiple stores, several times). Was proof enough that quick check wasn't worthy competition.
Wawa.
Wawa sandwiches are so much better, Food and selection is better. Quick check is ok in a pinch and it's also cheaper.
Wawa and honestly there‚Äôs a gap. I went to QuickChek often after work in maplewood religiously and when Wawa opened I just couldn‚Äôt go back. More variety and QuickChek is usually super understaffed
I grew up in Quick Chek territory. Now I live in a town that has both.
I always saw Wawa as ""special"" since I wasn't used to it. But now I see Quick Chek as ""Nostalgic"" since I'm no longer used to it. 
In all honesty, I prefer Quick Chek but recognize Wawa may be objectively better?
I just wish Wawa had self-serve iced coffee like QuickChek
QC has gone wayyyyyy downhill over the years.
They're both gross. So many good delis and restaurants to go to instead.
Wawa is the only and correct answer.
Man's talking conspiracy theories in them first sentences!
ITS TAYLOR HAM N AINT NO SUCH PLACE AS CENTRAL JERSEY! LOL

But Wawa tho and I had to wait a long time to get one close now I'll drive the extra 10 min depending on what I want.
Wawa
Wawa is overrated. I grew up with quickchek and moved to wawa land and saw the hype, but the quality of food has gone downhill by both places. It seems wawa has the nostalgic edge
Wawa sandwiches are infinitely better, and their branded iced tea is the best I've ever had.
I only had QuickChek until very recently and WaWa is definitely superior.
Who the fuck goes to quickchek? How is this even a question. In my town there was a Wawa and quickchek next to each other. Wawa is still rockin and quickchek shut down due to lack of business. End of discussion.
Quickchek has better cheesesteaks. 1000%. Wawa has better.. everything else lol
IMO, the good quick cheks are better than the good wawas. But wawa on average has better stores.

Neither are as good as they were 10-15 years ago, however. I wish we had sheetz. That's my favorite
Got a Wawa gift card bc i mobile ordered a sandwich and it had a load of plastic in it üíÄ
i grew up in central jersey (a real place!) and this used to be solely quick chek country, but ever since wawa came to these parts, i only venture into qc for a drink and a snack. i like wawa's coffee a lot more (at least the colombian coffee they offer, their regular is pretty weak dishwater), and wawa has the gobbler during the holiday season (this is the only sandwich i honestly order from either store at this point--neither one makes good sandwiches at all these days, it's all cheap meats and lousy bread. this isn't the 80s and 90s when they acted like real delis anymore). wawa remains my choice.
I used to be a QC truther, but then I got some sammies at Wawa and converted harshly. I agree that QC has better coffee, but I'm a snob with that anyways and only drink the home brewed stuff.
Wawa but there's some things I prefer at QuickChek.
I‚Äôm from south jersey and I gotta say quick check has always been better every time I have it
Bucky‚Äôs needs to come to NJ and show everyone how it‚Äôs done.
Both are good for different reasons!
Wawa is slightly better, but both are pretty mid these days.
Royal farms is better than both. You can get fried chicken, biscuit, and potato wedges for less than $10 lol
I go to both almost every day. Both are 24hr stores I frequent. But Wawa has a better variety of sandwiches.

The problem I have is that neither one of them is making breakfast sandwiches at 3:00 am.  

Both are miles better than 7 Eleven.
Wawa smells weird. QC doesn't.
Both suck. The one thing I miss from growing up in PA were the Sheetz
They‚Äôre both horrible quality for everything. Sandwhiches are tiny and expensive, gas is more expensive as well. QC is selling stores left and right too.
Both are fine. Wawa wins for me mostly for the nostalgia. Why do all QuickCheks smell like *that* though?
Depends on what you want and what you are getting. Mac and cheese is trash at Wawa. Deli meat is trash at Quick Check... I get Rockstars. They're cheaper at Walgreens than either Wawa or QuickCheck. 

Picking loyalty to just one establishment for no reason other than fanboyism is crazy to me, but to each their own I guess.
Having worked at a quick chek, all I can say is NEVER order anything from their deli case or buy prepared salads. You will die.

![gif](giphy|iumyeiZEFw2Sk)
Wawa's for the food, Quickchek for the coffee.
I don't care which one is better, because both are the same in some way. But Wawa has better shakes than quickcheck in my opinion.
Aside from food and drink, what about QuickCheck vs Wawa for their gas?
Wawa, Quickchecks‚Äôs quality has fallen dramatically since the pandemic.
Dude 7-11 is better than Quick Check cmon
Quick Chek has all day breakfast
Sandwich quality is about the same. I like that QuickCheck has the Portuguese rolls. I don‚Äôt drink coffee, so can‚Äôt compare. Drinks and snacks are about equal.
Neither. Heritages is the way.
Wawa gouging on the gas price 20 cents higher then other offerings
Qc was better when I was younger but Wawa has a better selection and quality.
Wawa but I go to Quick Chek more often because I live by at least 10 of them.
QuickChek for light roast coffee and their potatoes. Wawa for everything else.
I would say it depends. 

If you‚Äôre talking sandwiches/hot food, then it‚Äôs Wawa hands down. 

But having moved closer to a QuickCheck than Wawa, I will say that QuickChek‚Äôs bakery is far superior.
In my experience, Wawa‚Äôs air compressors are always broken and blocked by people waiting to charge their Teslas. QuickChek‚Äôs air compressors are rarely broken. 

As for the food, it‚Äôs all pretty much the same.
My last visit to a quickcheck observed 1 employee for the whole store mid-day, all the coffee was watered down.
QC for coffee, Wawa for baked goods
Wawa. I used to go to the local QuickChek and liked it a lot... years ago. But their sandwich quality and price have both gone in the wrong direction. As far as other product availability on the store, they seem to be about equal as it varies from location to location. But for prepared foods, definitely Wawa.
Wawa for food, quick check for rewards app
Wawa it's really not even close
Wawa subs and fountain sodas reign supreme. Quikchek could never.
Quick check has better baked goods but everything else I prefer wawa
Wawa is the only way to go. The food and drink are on point
Sheetz
Can only speak for coffee, Wawa is superior
What kinda fuckin question??
Wawa not even close
How is this a question? Wawa wins every time
How is this even a question? QuickCheck absolutely pales in comparison.
don't be silly, it's WAWA
Wawa
1) Wawa
2) Quick Chek

7-11s are all smelly. They all smell like old coffee and rotting fruit.
Wawa
depends on what you're in the mood for

i think quick check makes a better deli sub and better soups, but wawa has things like the turkey gobbler and their burgers aren't too bad after midnight

wawa has the fancy fountain soda machines

krauzers tho
Wawa only because the ordering system doesnt yell at you like QC lol
Both have cold sodas, ice dispensers, hot breakfasts, snacks, and (fuck 7/11) bathrooms. I'll take either anytime.
Wawa kinda fell off. Either is fine for me tho
I like both but personally quick check especially the gas station ones it‚Äôs more nostalgic
I used to like quick chek better but the one near me is fucking abysmal. Any time of day, absolute trash and everything takes forever and kinda sucks. I only stop in for drinks now. 

Wawa is fine, but I wish we had a Sheetz.
wtf is QuickChek?

Edit: oooooohhhhh it‚Äôs a north jersey thing
Sheetz. I wish more were here.
Your friend probably also calls it ‚ÄúTaylor Ham‚Äù. Case closed.
\^ This.  Wawa always had the better deli made to order sandwiches.
I actually think quick chek has gotten WAY better than it used to be.

But wawa is still better.
My first thought, verbatim lol
Agreed.
1000% !!!
QC also has better coffee. Other than that? Yea, Wawa
quickcheck and kings have the same soup supplier

just a fyi
You know ball.
This is the way.
Really? I actually think Wawa has pretty decent soup but I haven't had QuickCheck
Fun fact, Wawa‚Äôs soup is just Campbells
Came here to agree with this. I love Wawa for the smoothies and sandwiches but QC soup especially their chicken pot pie is still my favorite.
I fantasize about Wawa‚Äôs half lemonade half iced tea
I'm still devastated that they took away raspberry diet iced tea half gallons sometime in \~2021.
Very good Iced Tea but nothing beats Turkey hill.
Better than Clinton‚Äôs iced tea ?
I'm a QC guy, but I will give Wawa their iced tea; it's amazing lol
I read that as breaded iced tea lol
Sad upvote because no Sheetz in NJ. And yes Buc-ee‚Äôs is in a league of its own
  
\#MTO for life
Omg sheetzzzzzz
I used to live in Phillipsburg and I would drive across the bridge to get some Sheetz in Easton, PA. Once Sheetz expands to New Jersey, it's all over üòÇ
Comparing Bucees to wawa is like comparing Taylor Swift or Beyonc√© to your favorite local dive bar singer lmao
Sorry, Buc-ee‚Äôs is ridiculous.  100 pumps and a crowded building.
in terms of ""gas station food"" its:

Buc-ee's

sheetz

wawa 

quick chek

eating literal garbage from the anus of a vulture

7-11
I love Sheetz
No way sheetz is def not better than wawa. Bucees isn't a fair comparison either that's like asking whether costco is better than 7-11
I always heard Sheetz was so good and I was on a road trip in PA, so I stopped at one, off the freeway.

Not impressed.   

It was dingy, the aisles were narrow and crowded, the bathrooms were old and dirty.
I was going to get food, but the whole experience killed my appetite.

It had the ambience of an old off-brand gas station, not a legitimate competitor to Wawa.

Even the tiny old Heritages stores have better presentation.
There used to be a Buc-ee's billboard in NJ, basically telling you to drive to Florida. It made me wonder if they were considering coming up here.
Bruh thank you lol, people here acting like these are two wildly different stores lmfao. Like come on,  they are essentially the same damn thing these days. How can one possibly be so much better than the other
Yeah. I don't have to order iced coffee from the screen at Quickcheck. Wawa's self serve iced coffee is so sickeningly sweet.
Cumberland Farms would like a word.
Middle Jersey is a great term. Reminds me of Lord Of The Rings ü§£
Also, yes those pretzels are so good. Sometimes I'll get the quickchek pretzels and get really disappointed over how dry they are
Might be unpopular here but was gas been going down hill ever since they blew up in NJ
Another edgy anti-capitalist, who think they are the bees-knees. 

Bet you your response is going to be ‚Äúok, bootlicker‚Äù
They do.¬† But I questions the chemicals they use to flavor it.¬†¬†
Found the guy from South Jersey or central that doesn‚Äôt exist.
100% agree. Don't give me a pizza. Give me a better hoagie.
happened to my dad at a Wawa gas pump (in PA, but still)
Temu 711 ü§£ü§£ Dang. Which QC is this?? Personally, I feel like Wawa and QuickChek are on the same level as Walmart is to Target
There is totally brand loyalty for Wawa. I see a lot of Wawa parody shirts and people making memes. I don't see the same thing for QuickChek
Quick Stop beats out both.
Being from PA, I do wanna ask: Wawa or Sheetz?
No Jersey Sheetz that I know of. I prefer Sheetz stores' aesthetics and cleanliness, but I think their marketing is kind of cringe. Like it came in from the 90s Taco Bell or Doritos marketing departments üòÇ
They have it at mine in north jersey
Wawaland is now my new term for South Jersey ü§£
Whoa! That's crazy. I've never had the cheesesteak in either place but I figure the one more closely associated with Philly would have the better steak
So the gift card was in the sandwich?
Not until we get rid of full service gas. They can't afford to cover that many pumps effectively in NJ.
Love Buc-ee‚Äôs. Buc-ee‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt work in NJ unless we turnover the rest stops to them. (Not impossibile).

It is a Wawa and Cracker Barrel gift shop, in a building the size of a Costco. Buc-ee‚Äôs needs volume. We just dont have the road/space outside of the major toll road rest stop to support one.
I went to one of these places in one of the NJ Philly suburbs and it was a pretty good experience. I did like the fried chicken option.
QuickChek allows me to give the gas attendant my rewards number so I can earn points. Wawa does not in New Jersey.
I don‚Äôt know where you live, but in my experience, 7-11s are pretty bottom of the barrel. QC and Wawa are way better.
I feel this. I can give the gas attendant my QC rewards number, but Wawa only rewards gas purchases at out of state gas pumps where you do it yourself.
Never in my life had I considered getting a burger from Wawa but now I'm very intrigued
my wife tried one of their burgers and told me she instantly regretted her decision.
Every time I've gotten a QuickChek deli to order sandwich it's the most sloppy, barely thrown together mess, half the time missing ingredients if I don't immediately open it to check. So as much as Wawa sucks, at least I usually get the mediocre ingredients assembled as asked for and not looking like it was a toddler attempting to put together a sandwich.
Yup‚Ä¶ I just went to QC this morning, and the bfast sandwich was shite. Eggs were squishy and fake(r) tasting, meat was subpar.
This 100%  Wawa only!
100%. I used to think QC sucked ass vs Wawa, but QC coffee is far superior, and that‚Äôs usually all I really get from either place, so I actually end up at QC way more often. But for everything else it‚Äôs definitely Wawa - but that‚Äôs not to say Wawa‚Äôs quality hasn‚Äôt dropped dramatically since the mid 2000s though.
This here. Wawa's got much better food. QC's got better coffee.
As a non coffee drinker I acquiesce üôÉ
I used to live next to a QC. I miss their coffee so much.
QC has better breakfast. They use Thomas English muffins and Texieras Portuguese rolls. The coffee is also better and i like their rotating flavors.
We used to call it liquid crack. I used to drink a half gallon a day when I was younger.
I miss when it was $1.69 for a half gallon.
Turkey Hill blueberry iced tea was the flavor of my summers when I was a kid.
Are Clinton's iced tea still around? Haven't had one since hs and man were they good!
Never had Clinton's iced tea.  Don't recall ever seeing it.  Where was it sold?
I used to love Wawa's ice tea but I dunno at some point it changed and it started tasting like coffee and I stopped buying it.
Yeah Buc-ee‚Äôs makes every other brand look bad.

It will probably stay great until the owners cash out and sell to private equity. 

A couple of years later it will just be a shell of its‚Äô former self.
It‚Äôs disgusting. I will never understand the love of sheetz lol.
I would be shocked if there isn‚Äôt one in the next 5-10 years.
Or wawa has that fountain(?) for iced coffee and it's premixed with cream/sugar.

I'm convinced it's really milk mixed with something like ubet coffee syrup. Its absolutely horrid.
Haha amen.  Cumberland Farms is the closest to my house but it‚Äôs so gross I haven‚Äôt been there in 10 years.
I‚Äôm biased because I spend the vast majority of my time here but Middle Jersey is best Jersey
They‚Äôre such a distinctive texture, I love them. I didn‚Äôt get one yesterday as we were just getting lunch sandwiches and my husband was like oh no what‚Äôs wrong? Do we need to turn around so you can go back and get one?? Lolol
Would they be wrong?
![gif](giphy|3ohc0ScUjq8pPTB4Z2)
Hope he made out ok! I was lucky I got it, I had more money in my account than usual  because I was renting a new apartment, so I could have lost my security deposit and 1 month rent.
In bordentown lol I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs even there anymore. My memory of it is from like the early 2000s
Haven't been to a Sheetz very often but liked it ok. They seemed to have more hot food options than Wawa (though this is going back many years
Wawa? Is the cream and sugar already mixed in?
Philly will always be on top in cheesesteaks. They‚Äôve mastered their craft. Quickchek jalape√±o cheddar cheesesteak however‚Ä¶ UNREAL. Actual crack
Makes sense. They also pay their employees very handsomely.
The inside is pretty nice. All of their shelves are illuminated and it makes it more inviting. The chicken is on par with any fast food place
Burger is pretty solid. I really enjoy their quesadillas
they added them last year but they don't start making them til after 4pm
did she get one before midnight?

they taste fine if you're getting them at 1am
Quick check used to have decent sandwiches‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gone downhill last 10 years
QC‚Äôs monthly coffee flavors are excellent. Only exception to this was the New Years Resolution one which was AWFUL
I was thinking this exactly
They are gone and sadly missed by many.
I‚Äôm going to say North Jersey.
damn that suck to hear.  I haven't had it in a while- I guess I'll need to try it again, but lower my expectations
I‚Äôm glad to say I‚Äôve been to a buc-ees. We were doing a long drive and my wife saw a sign and said she‚Äôs heard of them being this crazy thing so we said we need gas anyways.. okay.
Thats what I'm saying. Wawa's only self serve option is that pre-mixed sweet milky stuff. If you want plain iced coffee you have to order from the screen.
But the north is so cozy! Everyone I know lives like 5min away!
No but seriously, any part of Jersey is the best Jersey
You‚Äôre lucky we can at least agree on Wawa.
It's probably not there anymore. They recently built a gas station Quickchek at the bottom of the hill that intersects with route 130. Super clean and modern.
Yeah lol that‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs not just coffee if that‚Äôs what you wanted.
Interesting, I feel like it‚Äôs the opposite. Quick Check to me has improved enough over the last decade or so and I feel it‚Äôs more or less on par with Wawa. 

I think all the Wawa love/QC hate being shared in this thread is a bit outdated & exaggerated. Both are fine to me, but I really don‚Äôt get how someone can claim Wawa is Gods Gift to Earth while also believing Quick check is pure trash. Like they‚Äôre both so similar now lmfao
So has wawa.. but they are still better than QC's

They have some police working the traffic lights on 15, sometimes they don‚Äôt . but imho they got to do something full time.
Coming home yesterday I said screw it im going the scenic route and hopped on 46 at exit 4, took it to 10 then 287. Took 15 minutes less than sitting in traffic.

This will be great with all the I80 sinkholes
What politicians and or news outlets can we reach out to about this? It would be smart to draw attention to the fact that they are returning 6K folks right into the heart of the mess when it is absolutely unnecessary. Maybe with some media attention and political pressure we can get the RTO for Picatinny extended until the 80 problems have been fixed. It took some folks I know 40 minutes to go 1 mile on route 15 the other day.

Edit: someone (not me) should post this to Route 80 rants so we can watch them lose their collective shit.

Traffic is already a nightmare with the sinkhole problem. If anything, working in-person should be pushed out to sometime after 80 is opened again.
My son and son in law both work there, they live in the Randolph/Roxbury area and are not looking forward to it.

My suggestion to the feds being forced to go to work in person is to always drive the speed limit as a form of protest.
It would piss people off and raze attention to the issue in a way that‚Äôs impossible to punish
Yup, and no exceptions for the sinkholes.
So basically you‚Äôre saying - you only had to go in 2 days a week but anytime you needed to be in person you‚Äôd go in anyways. It‚Äôs almost as if good workers can be trusted to get their work done the right way and don‚Äôt have to be forced for pointless reasons eh? 

Sucks for the added traffic but this is what we get.
JFC. Thank you for posting this.

I am already avoiding 80 at all costs, so will keep doing that until it's all back open again. So basically, until I retire.
I'm sure all the sink holes during this time will stop by then. üò¨
April Fools?
The sinkholes are causing lane closings on I80 and flooding the local roads with all the traffic. I guess your not in the area and never need to travel during Rush hours.
""Trump made traffic bad"" is hilarious. Out of curiosity, are 6000 employees reporting to the same office?
Oh so now these ‚Äúscientists and engineers‚Äù think you could help the roads by reducing traffic and weight during the repair period. Likely story, Poindexter.
Who does this help?
Just have your immediate supervisors implement a hybrid work schedule.
April 1st? Been back for a month at full force.
April 1st? Been back for a month at full force.
I don't think an additional 6000 people is going to make much of a difference given the total amount of daily traffic on these roads. I-80 near the I-280 interchange sees over 150,000 vehicles per day.
""THANKS FOR TRAFFIC TRUMP"" 

I swear the ""Thanks Obama"" meme is becoming the ""Thanks Trump"" meme...

You wanna know why theres a fuck ton of traffic on I80 and 15??? Fucking mine shafts collapsed under 80....
Give me a break.
do you realize how many cars pass through there every day lol. it's a lot more than 6k

also this is some questionable math because I am friends with a few people who work there and they've been in person full time for a while now

trump sucks but let's not make this about you disliking going to an office
Lmao - the agony of people having to work again. Bad trump bad!!!!!
Time to come to into the workplace like the rest of us. 

Turning this into a political thing is ridiculous.
SUE THEM!
Let's say the bottom 10% is milking the telework system. This is being generous. That's 60 employees half asking their job on our tax dollars. At least 3 days in office should be required - or, reduce headcount and leave hybrid schedule as-is. On another note, NJ traffic is a mess.
So you're saying you can't do work by being at work? You're going to do a better job through a zoom call? I'm calling bullshit, you're just upset the 5 year holiday is over.
edit: clearly you have your priorities.
46 is already a disaster around this area. Single lane in a lot of places, boatload of traffic lights, etc. It's really not fit for purpose.
Exactly.
Rt23 has had an extra hour of traffic every evening since this, my 90 minute commute has taken over two hours. Absolute madhouse until you hit Jefferson.
Yep. I left my parents, who live up 287 near the NY state border, at 6 pm Sunday. On a normal day, it takes 50 min flat to get home. I knew it was going to be longer with the detour, but it took close to 1 hour 40 min. There was an accident on the detour, so police and ambulance had to come take care of that. It was just a parking lot for awhile.
While I agree with you, honesty, there isn‚Äôt much that can be done. Even if they have someone there 24/7 the amount of traffic that comes through that area is ridiculous. No way they can detour all those people without there being traffic or affecting the towns around it immensely.
Yep. And not a single town cop assisting with traffic control. If I lived in one of those towns I would be mad. What are they being paid to do if not make sure that the whole center of town isn‚Äôt a parking lot?

Looking at you: Kenvil Police Department¬†
Just got to make sure my 5 bullet points, weekly emails, gives all the green flag trigger words to the AI trying to fire us; that they are feeding our responses too.
Good luck getting Trump and Musk to give even a tiny shit about that.
The point is to make them quit. They want them to suffer.
Does it benefit the worker in any way? If so, Trump and Musk are against it. Does it make the worker suffer and try and get them to quit? If so, Trump and Musk are actively making it SOP.
Lmao, I'm a federal worker and they keep on pushing the date UP to fuck with us. First was end of May, then mid April, and now April 1st. Won't be surprised if they force us all in tomorrow to be honest. 

They don't care about anyone inconvenienced, be it federal employees or not.
Trump will drive through in his motorcade to see the hole and have you sitting in traffic for 3 hrs.  He DGAF about your commute.

If it ever affects him getting to Bedminster for golf you might see action, or if someone on Fox blames the sinkhole on DEI maybe.
Trapped is exactly it. My town along 80 is usually quiet and traffic free‚Ä¶since the sink holes, my 5 minute trip to the grocery store on the back roads has turned into 35-40min. Gridlock. Great to hear it‚Äôs going to get worse.
Nope, not allowed. Specifically been discussed.
Hi that's me! If I can manage to get through this traffic I may just move to the other side of the world so I won't need to do it again.
I'm sure you know this but you can go onto usajobs and search for Picatinny.  My buddy has a few veterans working with him.
Most of the people I work with are not Trumpy, but there are a few around here.  Most have gone quiet.  

I was talkin with my wife about this a few weeks ago... She is in private...  she said ""How could anyone who works in the Federal Government vote for trump?!?! He literally said when campaigning, he wanted to reduce the size of the federal work force and make it easier to fire them?""

(fire us by making us schedule F to remove civil service protections).
My parents have not been to their house in the poconos since the first sinkhole.
There‚Äôs 3 so far.
It is truly truly nightmarish.
Exactly, go no higher than 59 on all highways in NJ and watch as this state whips itself up into a fever
This is my new form of malicious compliance. Drive as annoyingly, yet legally, as possible. Oh and no I won‚Äôt hear your horn, my music is too loud, but that‚Äôs not illegal either. No I won‚Äôt see you flashing your brights at me, I don‚Äôt angle my mirrors in a way for you to blind me because you‚Äôre upset anymore, got sick of that. Deal with it. Like everyone else has to deal with this shit. 

Oh you‚Äôve been waiting 5 minutes to make this left turn, I‚Äôm going to block and turn and slowly as possible and hope someone comes behind me so you can‚Äôt go still. What are you going to do about it? üòÇ
They are trying to get people to quit.
No, unfortunately, its real.  üòî
Yup.
Yes, those lazy rocket scientists that specialize in roadway engineering.
Cheap wins in the headlines.
It will when 80 is closed BOTH ways and EVERYONE has to use the same exit as the arsenal
Non-bargaining members returned in February (managers, SESs, some higher paid people who are above GS13 pay grade that are no longer bargaining members from taking a promotion), like I said in my OP, for bargaining members, it was postponed to April 1st thanks to the Union, which is the majority of workers here.  

Also, there is Army and Navy here.  All on Navy side RTO'ed back in February as well, but the vast majority are bargaining members for the Army.  

Your ""Friends"" either work for the Navy or are higher up the chain than the rest of us.
""Why aren't you feeling my pain?"" Says person in pain.
What do you mean the rest of us? I‚Äôm in a completely different field and most people other than the field workers which is a small percentage are working remotely.
no, listen, you dumb fuck, certain jobs can be done OUTSIDE of an office! just because you have to slog yourself into an office every day to complete YOUR job, doesn't mean everyone else has to! i commute and i wish as many people could work remotely as possible so i don't have to deal with as much traffic!
Do you get paid per boot licked, or is it an hourly position?
Political thing, meaning causing more congestion and pollution out of pettiness and spite?
Not a political thing. 

OP is referencing the fact that I-80 is currently closed both directions in Wharton due to sinkholes and will be for quite some time. The primary detour for I-80 traffic uses Rte 15 and goes right past Picatinny Arsenal. If all those employees have to RTO every day, it‚Äôs going to make an already horrible traffic situation much, much worse.
Speak for yourself. I work in the private sector and work from home. Only one side has turned this into a political issue.
""Back in my day, we walked 10 miles uphill to school both ways! ""
It‚Äôs more the fact that there are literal sinkholes preventing travel and residents of those areas rely on those two roads just to get out.. it‚Äôs just not necessary to make people drive in if the roads are closed right now.
> Turning this into a political thing is ridiculous.

I agree.  Why is Trump making RTO political?
Not every job requires being the workplace 40 hours a week. Many government offices don‚Äôt even have the space for all of the employees they are making return to the office full time, which is actually one of the reasons that federal employees have work from home days. 

Trump and Musk are the ones making this a political issue. 

You cannot deny that adding more cars to an already stressed traffic pattern will make things worse.
""I have to do this so you have to as well"" stfu
Hard to believe you want this!
are you unaware of the sinkhole catastrophes going on? & the trump EO's?
I worked hard to earn my Engineering Degrees and with with distinction, worked my way up from Poverty even working 30 hours per week while going to school... Slept in my office while getting my masters degree because I couldn't afford an apartment.  

Who are you to tell me, what I need to do?!? 

Also, this is VERY much political.  Trump is causing chaos within our economy and within the federal government.
Lol remote work was is work you moron. Obviously ‚Äúgoing into the office‚Äù did not help you learn anything new given your comment
I can tell you with certainty, poor performers are not allowed to telework and are forced to the office. Also, if you are caught abusing telework, aka, using a key logger while going afk, you will get caught and you will lose your telework rights for 1 year. 

When you are a fed employee, you are held to a very high standard. Most people in the fed are very talented high performers. 

There is only a secretary I know that is a poor performer and needs everything spoon fed to her. She was not allowed to telework.
How does it feel to hate life at home?
This is about the sinkhole traffic.  In case you been living under a rock, or not from NJ, this area is so congested due to the sink hole.  a 30 min commute now takes upwards of 2 hrs.   You can be concerned about more than one thing
We are talking about road closures and sinkholes.  Try and stay focused.
Are you lost?
I am intimately familiar with the narrow nature of 46 from Ledgewood to Denville, lol.
10 as well.
Great an accident ON the detour lol

What I did going up was I went past the first U turn (where they all are going), and I went to the next light (and made the semi-illegal turn) that way I was already on rt 15 and going west was much less traffic.
Yeah, that‚Äôs true, if I had to do that daily, I would really be working out other routes, I have a feeling it‚Äôs not going to get better the more they figure out what‚Äôs under that area
Yes. All their shits for this are in an undisclosed location.
Maybe true but also if they‚Äôre gunna give a shit about anywhere then I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd give a little of a shit about pissing off residents of Sussex county lol
Imo, they're trying to disincentivize working for the fed so people quit so they can say ""look how much we shrunk the federal workforce by - saving *insert large-sounding dollar amount that's barely a fraction of the budget* with zero downsides"" without ever looking at the downsides.
At that point you might as well walk if you're only getting a couple things.
Yup! Gotta make myself more marketable tho for that work haha idk what goes on there exactly but I always assume it‚Äôs like cool science big whig stuff and I‚Äôm just a lowly Engineer Officer who only has experience in an armored unit making things go boom üòÇ and I have a history undergrad from Seton Hall so not exactly the best candidate but I‚Äôll always shoot my shot!
I agree with everything except not angling your mirrors to shine back at the dweebuses with obscenely bright white headlights. 

I'm glad you can see into the future, Kyle, but you're genuinely making me going blind for several seconds.
Two words: CRUISE CONTROL!
Ok so what was going on before everyone started working from home?
OP is blaming the Trump administration and not referencing the sinkholes at all (although they obviously play a role in the increased traffic). OP even added a ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù flair.

I was 100% responding to the whining nature of the post and blaming Trump for everything.  Nobody likes traffic, but it‚Äôs part of life, especially in this area and other highly congested and populous places.
This gave me a good chuckle...  

""back in my day, we used to walk 10 miles to school in 10 feet of snow, barefoot, AND up hill!""

gotta add a few more things to make it really stand out...
Maybe it‚Äôs more about the fact that he (and many others) believe that in office work is more productive and efficient?
I‚Äôm guessing not and they probably don‚Äôt even live here
How hard you worked for your degree (like many of us have done) has nothing to do with your post and traffic and your opinion and anger towards Trump and his EOs ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Haha, this is the real April fools joke.
I'd rather contribute to society like the social norm that we have been living off for a very long time. Then just be a mooch, draining the system and not doing your part.

I love my home life, but I earned my time and place, I didn't just demand it for free
it's you that needs to focus
oh yeah for sure; I wasn't trying to imply you weren't haha. Just commenting that your point is doubly true for 46 because it's _such_ ass already.
10 West has been a shitshow all day today, and even nearby roads are a mess as a result. I said to myself earlier today, ""This is going to be a mess for months, if not longer.""
it just took me a half an hour to get from the intersection of 10/46 in ledgewood to netcong.  whatever the trooper say that intersection may be doing isn't working, light cycles are horrendous.
I never tried this but now I'm tempted. Is there ever a cop there? The choke point is that stupid Pondview Drive. Everyone is funneling in there from both sides. I figure the accident was caused by people squeezing in or someone flying up the shoulder to skip it all and squeeze in at the end. I saw that yesterday too.
They don‚Äôt give a shit about anyone anywhere. That‚Äôs literally the whole reason it‚Äôs happening in the first place
They don't care they're already in office.
They don‚Äôt care.
The majority of Sussex voters vote along the party line. Just look at the current commissioners and local politicians.
All the residents of Sussex county will worship Trump and now musk if they euthanized all the residents of Sussex county.
‚ÄúIn four years, you don‚Äôt have to vote again. We‚Äôll have it fixed so good you‚Äôre not going to have to vote.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt care about anything but himself, and he already got what he wanted.
Why would they bother, Trump voters aren't smart enough to understand cause and effect.  They just will blame the libs and immigrants
Why would they care ?
Yes, the goal of the administration is to get rid of as many federal employees as possible.  This makes it so there are more private sector workers which in turn depresses wages.  Also, it allows them to privatize as much of the government as possible.  Everything about this administration is robbing from everyone in order to enrich those who already have more wealth than numerous generations of families can spend.  Also, destabilizing the country to make it so that Russia has an easier time trying to take over Europe.
There's more than the science part. There's a lot of Acquisition that goes on. Do some keyword searches for project officer or even program analyst.
Actually, they hire equipment specialists, who are generally veterans. As well as other skills. Right now there's a hiring freeze at DOD, but once it's lifted, keep an eye out.
Former Army officer here who lives in Morris County and knows a few people who work at Picatinny. DM me if you wanna talk about it, and if there's any way I can help you, I'd be glad to.
Just to echo what a lot of others have said don't sell yourself short.  Quite a lot of what they do is actually outsourced to contractors so if you have any sort of project management experience you could lean into that.  

I'm sure Dr. Quinn would say you're a good candidate, lolol.
Oh it‚Äôs much more malicious than that. I don‚Äôt commute through any of the highways, just two lane suburb town main roads. I will drive below the speed limit at times if I feel like it or just enjoying myself on the nice afternoons were been having. Not turn for a while at a light so people don‚Äôt make it. Brake harder than I have to. It‚Äôs not good, but it‚Äôs not illegal.

Your downvotes mean nothing üòÇ you cannot stop what I am doing. Just reinforcing that I am annoying people. Which is the point. So again, üñïüèª and if I have to eat shit, well I‚Äôm gonna try and give you a taste too, it‚Äôs the NJ way.
No sinkholes
""I was 100% responding to the whining nature of the post and blaming Trump for everything.""

  
Uhhh Trump did force Federal workers back into the office. What are you talking about? 

  
""Nobody likes traffic, but it‚Äôs part of life,"" 

  
It doesn't have to be. We literally had a solution to reduce traffic. It's called WFH. Are you really this dense?
Who else is to blame for the RTO order? Are you saying that the RTO order wasn‚Äôt done by the Trump admin?  Making a blanket order for RTO without making an exception for this extraordinary case is a dumbass move and fully deserving of the flair.  This admin seems to think that efficiency means using as axe to remove a hangnail just because it gets the job done faster. 

OP assumed that most of this subreddit already knew about the traffic situation (it‚Äôs been a main topic here for the last couple of weeks) and your saying that this type of traffic is just part of reality in a congested state like NJ underscores how you don‚Äôt appear to understand the severity of this situation. I-80 is a primary East-West artery for truck traffic not only for NJ but for the entire country. All of that traffic has to go somewhere - local and state roads around the closure are being most affected, but other major roads like I-78 and I-287 are also getting hit hard by this.

Picatinny has had remote work in place for a while now - the only reason they won‚Äôt keep doing so until the traffic situation is resolved is because the admin has decided that remote work is ‚Äúwoke‚Äù. It‚Äôs the administration that has made RTO policies a political issue, not OP. Quit defending stupidity.
> believe 

Key word here.  And it varies from person-to-person.  I know people who perform better in office, and others who don't...at the exact same job.

Personally I get WAY more work done at home when people can't as easily interrupt me.

edit: Also, he's still making it political.  Why is that?
Lmao keep on the corporate bootlicking, hope you‚Äôre enjoying your soul sucking commute, I‚Äôm in my private corporate job WFH 3 days a week. And don‚Äôt worry chances are I‚Äôm still more productive than you are while WFH (in a consulting engineering role). 

The RTO directive is just another way for the upper class to crush the morale of the middle and lower class all disguised with the ‚Äúreducing federal waste‚Äùargument. It‚Äôs all just a way to force people to quit their federal jobs in order to afford the tax cuts for the rich (as the current economic conditions can‚Äôt support it like they did when the TCJA passed). FYI, federal workers in the engineering fields make way less than they would privately as I have colleagues that work for the USACE and their salaries are public record, I make about 40% more than they do in salary
""Everybody should be as miserable as I am"" - you
I‚Äôm preeeetty sure if you had to drive 2 hours to get home from your office 15 miles away you‚Äôd change your tune
Got no reason to lie. Picatinny has its on police department and has detectives. People have been investigated and arrested for doing things they shouldnt.  

Ill give you an example. We got a golf course at picatinny. One guy decided to leave his desk and go play golf while charging to projects claiming he was working. The detectives investigated him for about a month to get on to his pattern, then one day the police came out to the golf course and arrested his ass and I never seen the guy again.

So yeah, we are held accountable. Unlike our current POTUS.
Since you're focused on doing the best job, I think it's important to recognize ""we've always done it this way"" is a dangerous business model. 

I'm glad you do enjoy your life at home. You deserve that! I hope, one day, you can see that others prefer to contribute to society in different ways that fit their lifestyle.
Yep. I grit my teeth once school starts up because during those first few weeks it's *impossible* to make it through the intersection in Rockaway by the high school.
There were no cops there, it is the first light, I turned off, and it had that ""no left turn"" arrow that took you to the stop light. 
I guess if there is a cop there, i would just go straight and spin around in a parking lots, it still is way faster.

Yeah EVERYONE has to go that way that's why it's all messed up. 
You could go up a few miles and make a normal legal u-turn, i think there is a restaurant there.
Probably not but pissing off their wealthy supporters and donors would be pretty stupid. Maybe enough bitching and they‚Äôll walk it back or at least extend RTO a bit. I guess time will tell
Ngl I think this lends way too much credit to this admin in its forethought lol. I don't think Trump is capable of thinking as far ahead as you're describing.

Historically, we think of fascists as competent, but I really think these people are bumbling idiots who embody the stupidest aspects of contemporary conservatism. Trump only understands the paradigm of ""winners"" and losers."" Fewer employees in the fed is the easiest way to claim victory in his ""I made govt smaller"" agenda even if the overal budget and deficit grow.
Thank you for this I‚Äôll definitely start looking. Still have a few years until I get out, some goals I want to accomplish but I‚Äôll start making myself more competitive and see what the jobs are asking for. Thank you for your advice and help!
Sent!
I‚Äôve managed a few projects as an engineer officer but small in comparison to some of my peers since I‚Äôve been focused on the combat engineering side for the first three years of my career. I‚Äôll try and nudge my career before I get out in the path to get experience working for the corps of engineers hopefully but I‚Äôm heading back to Texas after summer back to the combat side again. 

Thank you for the words of encouragement tho! My wife and I are both from and raised in NJ and all our family is still there and would love to come back so I hope the stars align one day.
I see why out of staters hate us sometimes lmao
Ok... so what does sinkholes have to do with it? Are you saying sinkholes are making traffic worse or people returning to work or both? And once the sinkhole issue gets resolved will it not be a problem that people are returning to work?
Right.  You clearly have the entire picture of how hard every federal employee works.. all from your home office.  Also, that's not how a keylogger even works, haha.

And dont church up your base security.. every base has its own security/police but they are not Miami vice.  They certainly dont review and approve timesheets.  Obviously someone who worked with that person reported it, and if that one manager had not gotten involved, then they would be out there playing golf today, too.

Hate to break it to you but government hires who they can afford first.. their family members second.. and who they need last.  I've seen it for years.
Well two things to consider. I never want to bring my work home with me. I don't ever want home to feel like work. That's half of what makes home life so enjoyable. But to me you are shooting yourself in the foot with this argument. Because it sounds like the exact reason we should get back to the office, if your life is that much better working from home, sounds like you probably aren't working nearly as hard, when you are home to make that big a difference.
there's two? knolls or hills? i haven't been up that way in a minute.
Trump already won. He doesn't care now. He already got the votes and he's in. Now he isn't beholden to anyone.
They don't care when votes no longer matter. I wish y'all would stop sane washing everything this asshole and his asshole crew are doing.
Dawg I don't know how to tell you this, but they don't care.
That is just wishful thinking.
STOP THEY DONT GIVE A SHIT WHO THEY HURT.
Residents of Sussex County are wealthy supporters?
It's not just Trump running things though.

It's the tech billionaires and they have been planning this since 2009.
You make the mistake of thinking trump is running things.  He isn't.  Elon is.  At least directly.  Obviously they all are in cahoots with their Papa Putenesca and are taking his advice on everything.
The Republican Party has been playing the long game. Project 2025 wasn‚Äôt a whim, it‚Äôs been the goal for a long time. They now have the puppet who can entertain their base while they slowly rob the population and turn the US into an oligarchy. Their biggest win was the Citizens United case in 2010, which paved the way for today‚Äôs grim situation.
No problem! A lot of programs could use the kind of experience you have.
$20 says were gonna se him make a post at some point like ""I WAS ASSAULTED IN TRAFFIC""

Then we can just post these receipts.
while the highway is being repaired it would be a good idea to delay RTO
I think they mean Hills, close to 46 at Rockaway Road / Main Street. Knolls is on Franklin, off of 46 in Denville.
Indeed. He just wants to golf and bully people.
This needs to be a pinned post. They won, they don‚Äôt have to pretend to care anymore. They will continue to ruin shit by the day
And the Heritage Foundation. They've been working on this for decades
Thought there was a hiring freeze for DoD civs
yep and we'll all have a good laugh

reality is though this is reddit shower porn, this dork definitely gets anxiety going to the gas station 2x a week
And then have their own Jack boots sicked on them. Everyone‚Äôs cars have cameras now lol. You have to be retarded to get out of your car to try and assault someone. Let alone, be driving a luxury car, most of them are parents, going to throw away their reputation to look like a freak in public attacking someone‚Äôs car‚Ä¶ for doing what? Following the laws? I‚Äôm not blocking people in or holding up highways, I‚Äôm just driving, safely üòä
It's not a bad suggestion. That's more on the state to communicate that if they didn't yet. If they did, then the federal government needs to act. Sitting here and just blaming Trump because they want people working in the office instead of remotely is ridiculous.
No I mean Knolls, the intersection by the McDonald's in Rockaway gets backed up.
And dodge prison.
I think so, but OP said he has a few years until he's done with the military. Hopefully things are different by then.
This is someone whose desperate for big aplha recognition
Just because you are too weak to disrupt others lives doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else is. I‚Äôm not breaking any laws, I don‚Äôt get anxious from it because I am validated by that fact.
Just because theres more evidence that can be obtained doesnt mean its gonna stop someone from breaking the law lol
Murph already said the other day for employers to allow for remote work for people that commute through there. He's already declared it a disaster. It's all up to the Feds now.
lol I'm not sure how you think this act is saving democracy, Rosa Parks 

but should you grow the spine to act out your fantasy please do come back when you inevitably run into someone who makes you regret intentionally trying to cause problems like a child
Oh I don‚Äôt care about making things better anymore. Maybe that‚Äôs where you misunderstood. This is just lashing out to lash out. Who cares if it‚Äôs ‚Äúchildish‚Äù lmao that doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs legal, our leaders of government call each other names like children too. There is no decorum. I‚Äôm doing this because I can, we are a nation of feels, and this makes me feel good. If people are upset with a citizen follow the laws then their issue is with the laws."
Thinking About Filing a NJ Property Tax Appeal ‚Äî Worth It Without an Attorney?,"I‚Äôm considering filing a 2025 property tax appeal for my condo in Somerset County. I bought in 2019 and for a while, my assessment was going up around 5% per year, which seemed reasonable with the market. Last year, it jumped 17%, which I also felt was fine given sales but since then sales have cooled off a little, and now this year it‚Äôs going up another 10% ‚Äî putting me at a 50% increase since I bought my condo.

I didn‚Äôt mind the earlier increases, but now I‚Äôm being assessed higher than recent sales of identical units, and even some larger, upgraded ones in my development. And looking at sales after October 1, 2024, the sales seem to be trending down instead of up. 

My 2025 assessment is $452,500. I‚Äôve found five comps in the same condo community, all sold in 2024, ranging from $408K to $450K. The $408K unit is identical and similarly updated, and the $450K unit is significantly larger and nicely renovated. Depending on which comp is used, my implied ratio is between 105% and 110.8%.

I‚Äôve built a full appeal packet ‚Äî cover letter, Form A-1, photos, property records, etc. But before I file, I‚Äôm wondering:

Do I need a lawyer for this? Or is it realistic to represent myself if the case is solid?

Would appreciate any feedback or shared experience!",0.73,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jiq7dg/thinking_about_filing_a_nj_property_tax_appeal/,8,1jiq7dg,2025-03-24 13:06,"Always appeal. It costs nothing. You don‚Äôt need a lawyer.
We did it without an attorney and jt was approved. They made wild assumptions about improvements without doing an inspection.
I have a friend who went through this in Essex county last year. Massive jump in taxes- went from like $12k to over $20k. Probably due to what money others were throwing at homes in the area. They bought their house in about 2022 and even though it was flipped, the essence of the house didn‚Äôt change from previous assessments (same # of beds/baths and living space). 

They used an attorney and did win the appeal. Taxes still went up but not the massive jump.
That's what I'm thinking too. I feel like I have a good case, I provided clear photos of each unit and property data. The fee is $25. I was just wondering with all this information, what would a lawyer get for me. 

I could use comps in nearby condo communities that are even lower, but I figured using condos in my community would paint a clearer picture. Thankfully there were a handful of recent sales. I'm hoping they either accept my appeal or at the most negotiate something more in line with recent sales.
That's good to hear. Thanks for the advice. I don't even mind if my taxes go up either. Just not massive leaps unsupported by recent sales.
make sure you read up on your towns laws regarding re-assessments, how they are done, and what is considered in it.

Upgrades in many places don't impact, or meaningfully so, your taxes. You could have a gold plated bathroom with the most expensive fixtures in the world, and in most places it will just count as a bathroom. 

In most of NJ your taxes are composed of the value of your land, and then the value of improvements to that land (any structures). 

The structure portion is usually based on sq footage and liveable space, to give a sense of just how many people can live there, as that then correlates to the likelyhood of you sending kids to school (where the largest part of taxes go to).

Also your assessment DOES NOT EQUAL POTENTIAL SALE PRICE.

Your assessment is just the assessed value of your home, relative to the ASSESSED value of similar homes. Meaning, if your neighbor has a 3 bedroom, 2 bath on the same size plot of land as yours, and you have a 3 bedroom 2 bath, your ASSESSED value should be roughly identical, regardless of the condition or finish of the home (assuming it can get a CO).

Most places don't assess regularly, let alone every year. They level set the town, then just creep tax rates up to match the budget, until it gets comically out of wack, and then they re-assess. The end result as to what you pay in taxes ends up about the same.

If you poke the bear, its possible they come back and go, ""hey, we missed this on your previous assessment, turns out your assessed under what you should be, here is a bill""  Or something un-permitted a previous owner did turns up, or any kind of nonsense. 

Towns don't like when people fight it, because, well, everyone would fight it if the story always had an answer of ""hey you might get a break, you might not, but they won't go up""
That's good information. I believe my town does a land assessment and an improvement assessment. 

I looked up my director's ratio in my town and it's 93.83%. I believe this means that my town's assessed values should be 93.83% of the typical sale price. Since I'm in a condominium, I have a lot of comparable sales that are identical to my unit. The unit right next to mine, which is identical in square footage with similar renovations, sold for $408,000 in 2024. My assessed value for this year is $452,000. I provided other comps, but this comp alone would put my assessed value at 110.8% common level range, which I understand exceeds the legal fairness limit and would automatically trigger relief under Chapter 123. 

The other comps I provided put me at 105.2% common level range, which is within the legal range but on the higher end. I just hope this information garners some leniency from the tax board."
Vote by mail coming to my new out of state address,"Hi all,

I moved from NJ (Bergen County) to CT last year. I changed my license, car registration, set up change of address with USPS.

But the weirdest thing is that I am still receiving mail in ballots from Bergen County to my new address in CT. Don't they know I don't live there anymore? I don't understand how it makes sense for them to send a voting ballot to an address out of state - isn't it implied that if my address is not in Bergen County, that you should not be sending me a ballot to vote on Bergen County topics?

I of course throw these in the trash, since I don't want to commit voter fraud, but I don't know if there is some step that I missed or if somehow NJ still thinks I live there for whatever reason.......

Has anyone had experience with this and what did you do?

  
EDIT: Yes I registered to vote in CT when I moved here, and voted as a CT resident in the Nov 2024 election, not as a NJ resident.

Or registered to vote in CT?
You need to notify the Bergen County board of elections that you are no longer a resident.  Simply call the office on the mail order ballot.  The ballot is forwarded because sometimes it‚Äôs a temporary change.
NJ doesn't automatically register us to vote. We have to act.  There are several reasons that your address may have changed on one or a few documents, and they don't all mean your voting rights should be taken/altered. We have to act on telling them about address changes. 

They wait for you to tell them, or for your name to be officially challenged, or for your name to show up on a death certificate.  
They don't know if you are temporarily away at school, in the military, at a medical facility, or some other arrangement. 
If you attempt to vote twice, that would be a crime and other agencies could get involved at that point. 

[The Superintendent of Elections](https://www.co.bergen.nj.us/images/County_Officials/Superintendant_of_Elections/Voter_Guide/Voter_Guide_UPDATED_2021_08_10.pdf) has a voter guide with suggestions to address moving like ""inform this office"" and ""return the mail / *return to sender*"".  I would contact them. 


If you are still on voter rolls, then you may still get called for jury duty, too.  Obviously, you would have a valid excuse for not serving - but that's another set of communications you could be stuck following up on.

The food? Awesome. If you can actually get it. I guess they underestimated the demand last year because some of the lines were ~2 hour long wait times and stands were running out of food by midday. I, along with several others, also had to get refunds at the customer service booth because their online ordering system would not tell you if the item you ordered was sold out nor if your order was cancelled.

When I went to buy tickets, the fees weren't 25% ($9) of $12. They were only $3.93. I didn't buy the tixs because the event should be free considering I'm going to be spending more than the admission price. 
The event should be getting enough from the sponsors/entertainment to pay American Dream Mall.

NJ schools have until May 15th to fire their teachers for the upcoming school year. Otherwise their contracts are automatically renewed.

Check districts around you. Most use applitrack which makes it easier when applying to multiple districts
K12jobspot.com is the best place to look! More postings will be up as you approach May when districts starting sending out contracts for the next year and determine their staffing needs
A decent number of jobs get posted around the middle of May since that‚Äôs the deadline to tell people who are non-renewed.  Right now the jobs that are posted are for people leaving mid year or they already put in for retirement, etc.

What‚Äôs your budget? Rent or buy? Bedrooms? Do you have a car? Do you have kids?
Watchung has a community there that rents. It‚Äôs called Crystal Ridge. We just moved out because we bought a house.
Harrison, kearny, and belleville, are the closest suburbs depending on which hospital you'll be working with. They are all safe enough to walk around town. Harrison is the easiest to walk around, its just more compact. 

You might prefer bloomfield or montclair depending on which hospital. (You said matched, so assuming resident? )
Can you take a quick visit before you commit to an apartment?
Look into Verona or Caldwell too
Check out Secaucus
Harrison, Kearny, and Belleville are among the nearest suburbs. All three are generally safe for walking around. Harrison is the most walkable since it's more compact.
Go to Camden. Beautiful city
Newark, Patterson, Elizabeth are all awesome place to spend the rest of your life.
i could manage 2-2.5k on rent, would love a 2 bedroom but could settle for a 1 bedroom since the prices have been high. i would get a car, no kids, just me.
for reference im a 26 yo girl so i need it to be on the safer side!
I live in Bloomfield now and I love it. More safe and suburby compared to surrounding towns in my opinion
Was thinking the same thing.  Which hospital did you match at and where will you rotate for specialties?  That may help us figure out highway access to facilities.  Verona/caldwell/livingston are along the 280 corridor and is quick access to university.  I used to commute to University from Parsippany.  Hop on 280 and boom.  Right there.

Than what surrounding towns? East orange doesn't count.


Bloomfield is one of the lesser towns in the area actually.¬†
i‚Äôve been looking around there but i‚Äôm getting mixed advice about harrison from people who ‚Äúknow‚Äù NJ, some say it‚Äôs okay some say to stay away‚Ä¶
Kearny, Belleville, east orange, Passaic, Newark. 

Montclair and nutley are nice in my opinion though and they're also neighboring towns. Clifton has it's good and not as good areas
I lived in Harrison for years. It‚Äôs safe, quiet, and the people are great. There‚Äôs a nice sense of community and the public works department is the best! (Really‚Äîwhen it snows, they have it cleaned up so efficiently and effectively.) 

There‚Äôs also a lot of great food. 

It can get noisy by the river because of Newark, so I‚Äôd avoid an apartment over there if you want quiet. That was my only complaint.
The people you spoke to about Harrison maybe ""knew"" NJ, but don't currently ""know"" NJ. Harrison is gentrified af now.
No possible reason to stay away from Harrison other than it just not being your thing/what you are looking for.
Belleville is literally the same as bloomfield, and more suburbany-as you put it.¬† Newark is huge ccity-not comparable. Kearny is an industrial town with no much housing. East orange is a known sithole.¬†


Passaic is a different area. Clifton is perfectly fine and way more suburbany that any of the previously mentioned towns.¬†


Montclair and nutley are the nicest (read; most expensive)¬† in the area.¬†

What do yall think about vaping/vape stores,"I say this as someone vaped for 6 years and worked at a vape store: it scares me and I wish it never became a thing. The hardest part of quitting has been the person next to me puffing their disposable at every red light lol. Point being, it seems like a completely unquestioned part of our culture now. 

Is anyone concerned or pushing back at the concept of little Willy Wonka addiction stores in every town or at all. Next to no enforcement of age limits.

What scares me is the products being unregulated and targeting people who aren't already addicted to something as ""the healthy version"". The potency and the toxicity of these products is truly unknown:( 

It's weird to me how these stores can exist without pushback or regulation. I don't think a DARE style warning will prevent any kids from getting addicted to something before their brains are nearly developed. I just feel like it's something that needs to be addressed legislatively. Am I the only one?

Not sure what part of NJ you live in but vape stores are very strict about who they sell to since it's their entire business. 

Regardless, I personally feel you're only noticing others vaping because of your own struggles. For instance, of the 22% of reported nicotine use in the US, only [4.7% were vapers](https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco-nicotine-e-cigarettes/what-scope-tobacco-use-its-cost-to-society) in 2021 vs the 15.6% of cigarette smokers. In 1995, we had [24.7% of Americans](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050525.htm) smoking cigarettes. So not only are Americans smoking less overall, but more are choosing the lesser of two evils. 

Any study that doesn't have ties to big tobacco will show that vaping carries a fraction of the risk that cigarettes do. Nicotine itself is no more harmful or addictive than caffeine, it's the habit that's a bitch to break.
I kind of don't. I never smoked, I never vaped. It seems (in my uninformed view) that if you have an addictive personality, you can transfer it from one  substance to the other but you're still addicted. I'm grateful that I don't because I see/hear from friends how tough it can be.
They‚Äôre cringe as fuck
Personally, I think it is the stupidest thing you can do - You are breathing in highly refined chemicals into your olfactory and respiratory systems, not counting blood absorption and transport throughout the body.   

Why do you think chemical workers and first responders wear personal protective equipment?
Honestly I remember thinking the same thing my last year of high school when those first started becoming popular. There was this one guy in my class who would just pull out his ecigg and vape right in class and teachers wouldn't even always say anything lol. Of course not all even knew what it was and kids used to openly smoke cigarettes in the parking lot there all the time but the fact that he could just do that to me was kind of a bad sign that people were gonna treat that a bit more casually than they should lol
I don't think the major brands like Juul are that harmful and are probably safer than smoking for those who used to smoke cigs. It's the pocket fog machines that worry me. Here in NJ they banned all the fancy flavors, right? All you can get is tobacco flavor IIRC.
It's rampant among my underage employees at the business I run and I can't even tell what's in them but sometimes look high. They forget them all the time and then try to pretend it wasn't them vaping in the bathroom but I know who does it.

I know teachers that have caught 5th graders vaping in school. 

I think its disgusting but it's kind of just the evolution from cigarettes in my day as a way for big tobacco to keep youth addicted as regulations on cigarettes increased over time. 

I tried a cigarette in middle school and didn't like it but had friends that smoked daily at that age.

Difference is their parents did too and didn't give a shit. My kids will be in huge trouble if I ever catch them vaping.
""There ain't no zealot like a convert.""
Idc. 

I'm allergic to vape ingredients and weed but idgaf. I'm gonna worry about myself and let other people do what they want with their bodies.
idc what other people do
1. There is not much evidence suggesting it causes long term damaged. Nicotine on its own is highly addictive but doesn't cause much physical damage and has health benefits on its own, including protection from neurodegenerative diseases and increased focus and mental clarity. Cigarettes are dangerous because of the carcinogens, compounds yielded during combustion, and radioactive particles in tobacco.


2. Cigarettes are known to be incredibly bad for you. Vaping draws people away from cigarettes because they are stronger, customizable, have appealing flavors, the smell doesn't stick, and you can do it in your home without making everything smell.


3. The switch to vaping from smoking will save countless lives. Banning flavored vaping is one of the biggest health blunders since prohibition. We should be encouraging people who smoke cigarettes and joints to switch to vaping. And from there encouraging them to end their dependence on nicotine. But pulling people away from cigarettes is #1.


4. If we find vaping causes damage, we can regulate and use alternative ingredients that are safer. You cannot do this with cigarettes. You can't make cigarettes safer.


5. There is little evidence suggesting it alters brain development in teenagers, and less likely it does so more than cell phones and social media, but even so, the countless lives vaping would save is worth it. I would rather people grow up with a shorter attention span and chemical dependency (similar to caffeine) than have their older relatives die of lung cancer before their time.

Fear of vaping is just a hesitance to embrace something new because we are skeptical of too-good-to-be-true solutions. Like GMOs and vaccines. Better the devil you know. But the evidence is clear we can save lives by embracing this technology and improving it.

An offer letter might work depending on the landlord/mgmt company. But it's a case by case basis. You would need to clear it with them
Depends on the landlord. Corporate type places, likely not, especially if you can't show stubs from your previous job so there isn't a gap. They want to know you are stably employed before moving in, not that they just got a job and its going to fall through after move in.

Mom and Pops, possibly. While its becoming a bit more corporate in even how the old italian couple next door rents out the second floor and everyone wants to cross their t's and dot their i's (or has someone to do it for them and make sure everything is cool), a ""gut"" feel still works with most of them if you lay out a good case as to why, and how your job is stable.

My solution to the overcrowding,"NJ is really expensive and lots of people want to come here because of a multitude of reasons. At some point, it might be too expensive and some might turn around and find other states to live in but still want NJ. Now my solution is what if we gentrify a different state (preferably near NYC) with lots of Jerseyans.

How about we just build some fucking housing
Just annex Delaware.  No one would miss them
The solution to overcrowding, and several problems, is remote work. The government should motivate businesses to offer fully remote roles in the form of tax cuts. And offer owners of office buildings low interest rate loans to refurbish offices into apartments and condos. 

If that happens, it'll allow people to spread out across the country. Move away from cities and towns near them. Reduce demand for those homes and increase supply, bringing prices down for home buyers. There are tons of homes that are cheap around the United States but no one buys them because of work. 

Pushing remote work also helps with people having children which is important with low birth rates right now.
So you mean basically make Connecticut?
Wasn‚Äôt there a South Park episode like this?
Mikie Sherrill. 

Here's the thing. It might be cheaper to knock down the office building.  I think I read a while ago that is was easier to convert older brick factory buildings than more modern offices.

One of the other issues with NJ housing is that there are entire sections of the state that are unbuildable due to their natural state. Flood basins, preserved areas, and such. I live in Middlesex County, and they are jamming in every square of new housing into parcels that have been cleared of shopping malls (rt18) or in small towns with a corner parcel or two.

I agree, let‚Äôs take their weirdly shaped state
But the banks will lose money on their investments into the overbuilt and overpriced office space market and no politician would let the banks lose actual money.
This, we need to build up in cities and stop the suburban sprawl outward. We don‚Äôt have a lot of nature left in the state. It‚Äôs actually nice to have the pine barrens, and the northwest mountain ranges unspoiled.
You mean like van life but on the ocean? That could work
I forget which candidate it was but one of the democrats running for governor is advocating converting unused business and office space into housing. 

Shouldn‚Äôt this kill two birds with one stone?
Great on paper but not with the existing buildings. Nobody wants a windowless interior apartment.  Of course the center could be self-storage, something else for which we have a seemingly limitless appetite."

Having this is a frequent question, here's my list.  These are the things you may miss:

1.  Excellent schools, ranking first in nation: https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/public-school-rankings-by-state
2.  Fourth most diverse state: https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/most-diverse-states
3.  Second highest percentage of foreign born: https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/immigrants-by-state
4. Fifth most educated state: https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/most-educated-states
5.  Sixth safest state: https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/crime-and-corrections/public-safety
6.  Sixth friendliest for gay rights: https://www.thestreet.com/politics/the-states-with-the-most-and-least-lgbtq-equality#gid=ci02be3e82c0002732&pid=5-stonewall-ny-sh
7.  Fourth best health care: https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-jersey

Great and diverse restaurants, much more mass transit than other states, easy to get to NYC, Philly and beaches (the shore in NJ vernacular).

Some of this goes together.  An educated state will probably demand good schools.  Lots of diversity results in lots of different restaurants.

Negatives:

1. Affordability and opportunity, 49th ranked state: https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/affordability

2. Not particularly well run state, 39th: https://247wallst.com/special-report/2020/12/08/best-and-worst-run-stateamerica-a-survey-of-all-s-in-50-3/

3. The highest property taxes in the US, https://www.tax-rates.org/taxtables/property-tax-by-state.

4. High cost of living, 48th most expensive, https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/opportunity/affordability

5. The densest state: https://usabynumbers.com/population-density-by-states/

One more thing is people are pretty direct, you don't have to wonder if someone likes you.   Or as someone said we're kind but not nice.  Too dense to be that nice.
My plan is living half the year here in Jersey and half the year in Portugal. Seriously thinking about retiring early and doing it. I just can‚Äôt fully leave Jersey. While it‚Äôs expensive, I found there‚Äôs really no place like it for me anywhere else.
I like his you add ‚Äú‚Ä¶and my family‚Äù like it‚Äôs trivial reason to stay. For many people that‚Äôs THE reason why they remain where they are.
Born and raised in New Jersey. Joined the army ( stationed in Washington state ) and got out and moved to Arizona for 11 years. Just moved back to Jersey and I‚Äôm personally so much happier. 

Arizona imo one of the worst states. The only thing it had going for it was cheap cost of living and not a lot of people. 

Well that‚Äôs out the window and houses are near Jersey prices at this point. 100 degree days just keep on growing year over year. Homeless people everywhere you look, car registration is theft, 10 percent sales tax, water scarcity, etc. 

Northern az used to be super peaceful but good luck with that as it‚Äôs been over populated everywhere with 2 lane highways and traffic rivaling Phoenix at times. 

NE > NW > SW > SE
All I can say without writing a novel is that you won't know what you'll miss until it is gone. I've visited many different states and countries overseas and while it was great to visit them, I still love my home here in NJ even if it is far from perfect. (Yeah, Jersey Shore kind of guy)
Nah if you're 18, go explore. You're young. You're probably not tied down by a job or kids. Now is the time to do it. If you stay because of the food or because we're close to the beaches or the city, in 15 years you're going to be wondering what your life would have been like if you moved. And by then it's going to be harder. I say this as a 40 year old mom. I have a few neighbors whose kids moved to Arizona and they love it out there.
Different people are happy in different places. There's no one size fits all place. It's not a big deal. Go find where you're happy.
I'm staring down retirement and can't wait to leave.  I grew up in PA but moved to NJ when I got married.  I raised my kids here.  Now I need warm weather and a slower pace.
I love it here- I love how close I am to my two favorite places (NYC & the beach), I live all the variety of things to do, I love the view out my window- but my neighbors are...a lot...and our taxes are getting ridiculous. They're cutting bussing to the elementary school and there's no safe way to get kids there except to drive them all the way. People from more urban areas are coming here pretty often now to steal things and hurt people. And we're all but cut off from Northern NJ at this point, with all the holes on the highways now. 

So this summer... we're moving north.
Don't be a person that never leaves home (unless there's a pressing reason). That goes for any place, not just NJ, but NJ is up there. You won't have perspective if you don't *live* somewhere else. Visiting other places doesn't count. 

On top of that, it's definitely best to get out of the NYC<>DC corridor. This area thinks way too highly of itself, and while the stats offer reasons why, too much self-regard and being in a bubble are always detrimental in the long run. 

You will almost certainly have an initial honeymoon phase followed by a period of frustration and regret. This is normal and not a sign you messed up. It takes time to get used to different routines, different people, different expectations. Let yourself be changed in some ways. If you have integrity and some brains, you won't just become a lemming following a different tune. 

If you are free to explore a couple different places (not tied exclusively to a location based profession), then do that as much as you can. Explore for the novelty and experience. Don't beat yourself up if you run yourself broke once or even twice, it won't kill you and you'll gain very important perspective (but do keep your future in your vision, to some degree). 

Eventually you will figure which things you do love and which things you can do without. At that point you will develop reasons to be or go somewhere. Make sure to have reasons. Life will always hit you with frustrations and failures, and occasionally it will threaten you with the ""abyss"". If you have reasons why for being (being alive, being where you are, being with the people around you, being in a job) you'll be able to cope. 

NJ is flanked by some of the biggest airports in the world, so book a flight home when you can. But also, invite people to visit you‚Äînot everyone thinks about making those plans, so you have to offer and insist sometimes. (If you are doing really well and they aren't, offer to help. Not saying this is likely, just a thought. I wish some people had done that for me even I was going through some hard times, and I always offer accommodations to people if possible‚Äîhotels are expensive.) You will find out who wants/needs you in their life. Send physical mail and make sure people have your address. It's hard to make that effort these days, but worth it. 

I could probably go on, but I need to get back to sleep. It's an enormous country with a lot of people (3rd biggest by population, 4th biggest by land area), and it's incredibly diverse in the true meaning of that word (not the corporate/academic/ideological definition). It's incredibly useful and rewarding to learn something about it rather than become one of these people that whines about how we should be more like Norway or something. I've been on both the positive and negative sides of these words. I've succeeded and failed to do these things. They aren't hard and fast rules for living, but useful suggestions. You'll find a lot of different suggestions to collect out there if you keep looking, so keep doing that.
I‚Äôd be up for moving, but I BBC also enjoy what a NJ has to offer. It‚Äôs mostly the winters that I‚Äôm getting tired of, so not sure where there will lead me. I do have a van and have been to places like Moab, Colorado, Michigan‚Ä¶ for mountain biking and enjoy them all. But not sure where I‚Äôd move too. NJ actually has some great mountain biking as well as other outdoor recreational opportunities. In the summer I‚Äôd like to get to a point where I‚Äôm spending up to 12 weeks in NH and other New England states.
I grew up in NJ and moved to CO. Health care is better in NJ. The food is better in NJ, but maybe it‚Äôs just because I grew up with it and have been used to eating it. Hurricanes are more predictable than wildfires. I miss the rain and deciduous trees. Aside from that I don‚Äôt miss NJ. I prefer the mountains over the ocean. I like things to be spread out vs crowded. The people are different and it‚Äôs less diverse out west. If you are a woman reproductive health care is definitely something to be mindful of. I personally wouldn‚Äôt want to live in a red state for those reasons.
Moved to northern suburbs of Denver. Haven't had a bagel in years. Eventually I found passable pizza. The skiing is amazing. The hiking is amazing. Getting to the city is no problem and there are no bridges with $20 tolls. Got into college sports and love going to boulder for games. People here love the broncos more than folks at home liked the jets or giants. It's fun to watch them. Denver is 10% the size of NYC but that's still big enough that there's always something going on. The weather is nicer. I don't mind pumping my own gas. I'm rambling but bottom line I don't miss it.
The tale of every child who becomes and adult in NJ. Go out and see the world, your home will be here waiting when you realize you miss it.
Move. The world‚Äôs too big and there‚Äôs too many experiences out there to stay in one place your whole life. I‚Äôve lived in CA, Kansas and now NJ, and I love it here. I‚Äôve made friends and done things that I never would have otherwise if I stayed in CA my whole life. You won‚Äôt truly know the answer to what you‚Äôll miss until you leave, and you could always come back if it‚Äôs terrible elsewhere for you.
Moved from the Shore to the PNW. Love it move here everyday. There‚Äôs beauty in NJ and I will have parts of it I love, but man, what a fucked up place it can be. Wish I had left sooner.
I moved to AZ. Loved there for 6 years before deciding to move back. I missed the food, weather, and general atmosphere, not to mention my family. 

The biggest difference I saw was the people. It was very hard to make friends and connections. In NJ I could be anywhere and Simeon would offer to lend a hand. In AZ, people could watch you struggle with even the simplest task (like teaching the top shelf in the grocery store) and look the other way.
Go somewhere cheaper.
honestly here for the same reasons plus career options

this state is good, but this sub also grossly overrates this state. Mostly because the people where have never left JC or whatever and explored the state, let alone the country.
I lived in Jersey my whole life, 50+ years, and moved oos 6 years ago. I miss Jersey A LOT. There is nowhere else like it, and you will miss it.
NJ is home   

For all it's flaws, of which there are many,  it's still the best place to live in the country.  The people, the culture, the pace of life,  the abundance of things to do and of course the food    


Maybe it's not for you, and if it's not that's OK, you should move on and find a place that suits you.  

But when you're somewhere else and the monotony of day to day life sets in, when the people out there get on your last fucking nerve because they do something we'd never do here,  when you're bored out of your skull because there's just not the variety of things to do,  you'll sit down to eat and realize you need some good comfort food, and then you'll curse the fact you can't get decent rolls to make a good hoagie 

Beyond that, there's the worker protections and social safety net that's just not available in many states that aren't NJ or Massachusetts. 

12 weeks of family leave,  with partial payment of your salary,  similar to Disability insurance. 12 weeks to bond 26th your new baby or to care for a parent who needs looking after,  until you can figure something else out. You can't be fired from your job for that, and you won't be financially ruined.  

Our regular disability insurance is much much more robust than other states.   In NY they need to take out special insurance to get what we get and most people don't think to do it.   Here you don't have to worry, it's already law
Moab - I can't imagine living in a tourism hot spot. Also, as much as I hate the humid summers we have, I can't go more than 1 week in the desert.

Flagstaff - can you afford it?
You should leave. Why have regrets?
Go visit
You must live where you are happy regardless of the cost! Happiness is priceless and I love NY/NJ I‚Äôm not going anywhere. Except when I retire in Europe in 30 years lol
What do you mean by not your speed? Flagstaff is a pretty rural mountainous area with not much to do. If that's what you're looking for then you'll be happy. There's also tons of areas in NJ that are just as rural as flagstaff without the 110 degree summers. If you're looking for more things to do and more urban, flagstaff is definitely not the place for you.
You can always come back. Don't live with regrets and ""what if's.""
Before u leave learn how spin a pie 
And open a pizza shop
It comes down to what you‚Äôre looking for you didn‚Äôt really give much in terms of specifics. I‚Äôm a military spouse and have lived or visited just about every corner of this country and moving from one state to another can literally feel like moving to a different country real talk. That being said you gotta do the research (think places like niche.com, datausa.io, FB groups in addition to Reddit) and if possible visit places to get a feel and do a vibe check bc others opinions are just that. I can tell you factually the West and Southwest states are fighting for water rights it‚Äôs drying up out there and fires are just part of life out there thus increasing insurance costs. What may seem like an ideal place to live now may not be the case in another decade so think long term as you research. I am still trying to figure out where we are going to retire but NJ is high on that list. Best of luck to you!
I just want to know all about the ""amazing food"" in NJ.
Get out if you need to get out... but I know you'll have trouble finding housing in Moab
I was a life long nj resident and moved to sedona arizona (close to flag!) I always say this place would be perfect if my friends and family were here. I definitely miss NJ, but we try to visit as often as possible and have made a good community here. It‚Äôs different here- the people are different, the food isnt as good, you dont have access to as many major cities- but it is beautiful and different and you can see the milky way at night!! 

I know so many friends that have never and will never leave nj, in my opinion if you have to opportunity to live somewhere else take it! Either you‚Äôll discover a different lifestyle you love, or you‚Äôll realize you miss jerz and go back.
One word:  hicks
>I just wanna hear any arguments people have to stay in nj cause to be frank outside of amazing food and my family can‚Äôt think of much else

We're already pretty crowded so there's no need to keep you here if you're not happy. As someone who's spent a lot of time in both of those states, has lived all over, and is now re-settled in NJ, it sounds to me like you may be taking the quality of live we have here for granted. AZ is gross, hot, meth country. The indicia of poverty and the meth epidemic are rampant anytime you venture off the suburban alcoves. People in UT are creepy zealots more worried about keeping up with the Jones' than anything else. NOBODY gives a shit about you, they all just want you to join their church. God forbid you're not a super devote religious person. If so, I hope you're cool being a pariah. 

But, I'm assuming you've spent enough time in those states to formulate a different opinion so just go with your gut and bounce. Just don't complain later when you realize the quality of basically every necessary service you rely on is diminished. You get what you pay for and geographic location is no different. Those places are cheaper for a very good reason. Best of luck with your new adventure!

Godspeed.
I really liked the west coast (specifically So Cal) and Montreal (Canada) but despite spending a considerable amount of time in both places nothing beats NJ. Im from Hudson county and I hope I don‚Äôt die here but nothing really beats living here then again I haven‚Äôt tried living in Europe or anywhere south of the border.
You're getting a pretty good list of pros and cons. I lived in Phoenix for a year when I was just out of college. I know Flagstaff a little. Here's what I missed most:

1. You can't get decent bagels  
2. You can't get decent sandwiches or deli  
3. You can get halfway decent pizza, but it will never actually be good.  
4. You will miss the color green occurring in nature  
5. If you like alcohol, Arizona's a bit boring, and good luck with Utah (yes, I know it's better, but it's still well below NJ)  
6. Most of what I would think of as culture (live music, theater, museums, indie films, scenes) will either not exist or pass you by  
7. The diversity is flatter out there. Especially in Utah. Arizona has a mix of a few ethnic groups, but nothing like the all-over-the-world blend we get in Jersey. Factor that into restaurants and other culture.   
8. In Arizona, people are weirdly casual about guns. I saw a lot of open carry folks and that put me off for sure.  
9. Both states are different if you're a person of color. Some good ways, lots of bad ways. Same goes for if you're not straight or Christian (and in the case of Utah, Mormon).   


Here are some things I loved!

1. I'm spoiled on Mexican food. Every Mexican food place in Arizona is terrific. Go to the hole in the wall, the family joint, anyplace, and ask for the special. You won't be disappointed.  
2. It's an entirely different climate and ecology out there! So much to explore and do and have fun with. Mountains that are incomparably high. Deserts that are arid and beautiful. Places where you can be in shorts in the morning and skiing an hour later.  
3. State taxes are better; cost of living is lower  
4. Depending on the work you do, Arizona or Utah might be terrific. Or might be a disaster! You should definitely find out.   
5. Cars last longer. Less rain. Less snow. In Utah, they're prepared for snow. Although you almost certainly have to consider a gas vehicle and very likely an SUV. If you like motorcycles, it's AMAZING because the weather is almost never bad.   
6. People are more polite and friendly. As a born-and-bred New Jerseyan, it was kind of off-putting at first. But I adjusted. 

If you're younger than 30 you should leave tomorrow. (If you're younger than 40, leave in a week.) Explore the world! If you go somewhere and don't like it, Jersey will still be waiting for you when you want to come home. I didn't want to live the rest of my life in Phoenix, but I love having lived in Phoenix, you know?
My advice would be to go, as you never know until you try, If you are a homeowner, however, don't sell your house. Just rent it out. That way, if you change your mind, you have a place to come back to.
What you are looking for there, isn‚Äôt here.  Flagstaff is a college town with a different eco system than here.  Moab is trendy but isolated.  So, go for it.  You‚Äôll love the hiking and camping and biking.  All of that is here but just a little too hard to find.  As an aside, the NJ Park system is much more robust than most know.  With a Governor who cares, it could be amazing.  Besides the Shore, our vistas don‚Äôt measure up.  And while things aren‚Äôt as close as we like, just wait.  And NJ is less chaotic than portrayed and than what we admit.  But go where dreams can be fulfilled and don‚Äôt have regrets by not trying.
I‚Äôve lived in Jersey my whole life too ( I‚Äôm 26 ) I never thought about leaving but the more I drive around these days I want to get out of here mostly due to the drivers on the road ! It‚Äôs just getting worse. If I had the opportunity to move out of NJ I would. I would not want to start a family here that‚Äôs just me. Yes I love the city life and food is amazing like you said but it gets old at some point. Maybe try a different place in Jersey to stay so you‚Äôre still close to family and good food? If you don‚Äôt care about that then leave ! YOLO. Do what makes you happy. Good luck üçÄ
I love Moab, I‚Äôve traveled extensively and it‚Äôs one of my favorite places in earth. You‚Äôre young so just go out there and make a life for yourself. You can always move back so you have nothing to lose. 

I have a family here and a daughter so I could not imagine living in Utah or Arizona in today‚Äôs political climate but if I were 18 I would definitely go.
good weather.


Nj gets a bit of everything, but not extreme.¬† summers in moab will be positively brutal.


I will also say this: places to visit are not always great to live in.¬† Utah is a great place to visit, but once you move there you may find many issues,¬† make sure you talk to locals and look into things thoroughly.¬†¬†
Felt the same.  Went to AZ.  Felt like people were operating at 50%; especially with common sense.  Different scenery didn't outweigh what NJ has.  Move if you're ready.  U could always come back
I left to TX for a couple years and moved back. I moved back to Sussex County. It‚Äôs pretty nice here, it‚Äôs not overly congested and I was able to afford a house. 

I miss living in Jersey City, but I just couldn‚Äôt justify paying rent and never building equity.
Let us know when you get back as you will.
I wanted to leave Arizona as soon as I felt the scorpion guidance, tips & tricks were being delivered just a liiiiiittle too casually for me.
I‚Äôm one that believes everyone should life elsewhere from the place you are born and raised, if you want that. 

I was born and raised in IL. 25 years there. Corn country Illinois, not Chicago. Now I‚Äôve been in Florida for 25 years. I don‚Äôt miss those harsh winters. I was constantly sick. I get bronchitis maybe once every 5 years now, had it 3 times a year in Illinois.
When we left, my bf and I, now my husband, said we would be back in defeat within 2 years.  Jokes on them, we have done pretty good in Florida. Found one of the last sleepy beachside towns and made it our home. Problem is, others finally found it too. 

But I still love Illinois. The ppl are way more genuine. But politics have ruined both state. Illinois would be a red state if not for Chicago. Seems like majority of ppl outside Chicago are Republican. 

We all know what Florida is like. Lots ofNY and Jersey  folks here. My neighbors are from Jersey. But lots of everyone from everywhere here in FL. 

But we will likely retire in Illinois . Cheaper COL. And we own a house up there, never sold it. 

I say go for it. You are young. You can always go back . My one bit of advice is take only what you need -clothes, pics, what not . We brought everything and within a year had all diff stuff furniture wise. Waste to bring it all with us.
Both my husband and I were born and raised in New Jersey. We will be moving to Arizona in another year to be closer to my son who relocated several years ago. I love the vibe here but it is just crowded and frankly more rude and unpleasant than ever before. We are tired of the incessant sound of lawn machinery and paying over 10k in taxes, however, we realize AZ is not a panacea when it comes to taxes. We‚Äôre done and realize we won‚Äôt be able to return but it‚Äôs okay.
My grandparents moved to Arizona a few years ago bc it was too expensive for them in NJ but moved back because they missed their family here and especially the food. My grandmother gained so much weight when she moved back because she went to visit all the restaurants she was missing. They moved to south south Jersey so they‚Äôre a little farther from us now but it was cheaper for them.
You got kids or plan on them? NJ has some of the best schools in the country.¬†


It's really hard to move back into NJ once you move out unless your in a top earner job field.
![gif](giphy|lxQ53bXTjQtwpUItYB)
Find a place that's 'your speed'. Born & bred here in NJ, lived here my entire life (58). Can't imagine living somewhere that's a slower pace than here.
I hear it from my uncle and grandma in cape cod once your out of Jersey it‚Äôs so expensive to come back
Same, I didn't like the California vibe, though I lived in LA so maybe that was part of the problem. The people all just seemed kind of weirdly...fake? Compared to people here If that makes sense
Oddly reliable but I haven't been on the west coast as long as you.  Feels weird to leave the tri state area.
You know always forget can‚Äôt get bagels that‚Äôll suck
I think once you retire the cost of living in NJ makes it prohibitive.  Would love to hear about Colorado. Thinking of moving out of NJ in a few years.
Any insight on MD? Thinking of moving there
What‚Äôs Portugal like? Planning to go there IF I feel safe to travel in the fall with the current s### happening
Might need to steal your idea
> Northern az used to be super peaceful but good luck with that as it‚Äôs been over populated everywhere with 2 lane highways and traffic rivaling Phoenix at times.

I hate the traffic in Phoenix much more than I hate Jersey. It's like they kept adding a shit ton of lanes and well, now there's a shit ton of cars. It honestly doesn't make sense how sprawling the area adjacent to Phoenix proper is.
Agreed 100%! I've lived in multiple different states. Grew up in Orange County NY, then moved to NJ at 22. Lived in Prescott AZ for 2 years, Hollywood FL for 2 years, LA for a year. Spent some months living and traveling in Europe. I got tired of everywhere after awhile...nowhere ever felt quite like home like NJ does.
I was born in NJ but my family left when I was 9 months old when my dad graduated Rutgers and took a job in upstate NY and CT. However, all my relatives were in NJ so we visited often.  NJ‚Äôs in my blood.  I‚Äôve lived in 10 other states, DC, and Shanghai.  I call my move back to NJ in 2017 the end of my 50 odyssey to return to the state of my birth.
Kinda what I expect to happen but I think I just needed it to be said
The beach is nice but I can‚Äôt stand the city if I move north I‚Äôd be going to lambertville
Great advice üëåüèª
Honestly I like the idea of just moving around for a bit and flying back into nj if I don‚Äôt find my footing anywhere
Thoroughly enjoyed this reply!
Can you help me understand wjaf you mean by  paragraph 2?? Who thinks ??  Self regard?


Who cut this guy  off so bad he‚Äôs still pissed üòÇüòÇ and think ALL of us from ny-dc are giant assholes??
Yeah idk I just threw places on the wall to see what might stick but if I really had to look deeper I‚Äôd like to be more rural
Yeah not a girl but I do understand how that would scare many women away from the prospect of moving to a red state
Exactly my thought I‚Äôd be 29 when I can buy a house where my relatives are in nj so I guess I‚Äôll just waste away working if I stay
The ol we are kind but not nice and they are nice but not kind

Never met anyone who disagrees with it.
Not what I expected just from what I‚Äôve experienced in Arizona but I was not living there so maybe they are less inviting then i thought
The worst part about Arizona, or at least that I encountered with Phoenix is that no one is from there so you get a weird mix of so many different people from Seattle, California, and then snow birds from all over the US. There's no vibe to Arizona other than if you're one seeking out sonoran food.
So anywhere else that‚Äôs not mass or California
I agree that they always are die hard over this state it has some charm but idk if I agree on how much better this state is then others
Everyone who I know who has moved shares the same sentiment. Real reason i need to get out isn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs missing something but just because I want some peace.
We miss you too! Go get in on that bagel syndicate in another post!!
Probably can‚Äôt afford flagstaff for another few years but nj ain‚Äôt cheap either
Have already more then once
Been to flagstaff and it is exactly what I want just maybe a little more expensive then similar options
Father actually taught me to make pizza since he worked in a pizza shop for a while in high school so have that down
Also, we get bagels shipped from jersey here and keep a freezer full of them. There are just some things that nj provides that you cant live without
Accurate representation
Yeah thought about somewhere just past Allen‚Äôs town or maybe in Ithaca but I‚Äôm still looking places besides out west
There are actual paradises in this world, so I don‚Äôt think NJ has a lockdown on ‚Äúgood weather‚Äù. If you prefer 35-45 degrees and rain/sleet/ice to consistent San Diego or Bermuda weather, then you want to feel some sort of misery. Consistent great weather isn‚Äôt boring, people just look for external loci of their misery.
A lot of people have said something like this never noticed the people being less inviting but they probably are I‚Äôm not to social
I will
Yeah definitely a deal breaker for some for me no grizzly bears in my yard like my biggest fear
Hmm ok might take note of that bc I‚Äôm in middlesex county so maybe it‚Äôll be better farther south near Vineland or somewhere along that area
Plan on it but I would need to reevaluate this plan if I find someone who I definitely want to marry
OP ‚Äî avoid people like this ^ as much as possible.
It super nice to go from high to medium cost of living. The opposite is also true. If you want to go back to NJ once living elsewhere it is difficult.¬†
Umm, maybe your uncle and grandma have no idea how much their house on the cape is worth. Groceries are also a little pricey there. Not sure about the rest of the cost of living, but I‚Äôm up there occasionally and just find it overall expensive.
Exactly what I experienced.
My cousin moved to LA and says same!!!! And looks same.
That happens in San Diego, too. San Francisco is it's own thing but honestly, I'll pass on living anywhere around there. 

I'd rather the beaches on the East Coast too.
Yea‚Ä¶ and decent pizza. It‚Äôs borderline insulting what passes as good for these things outside of Jersey.
Very true. ""Cakey"" bagels are considered ""New York style"" here in the Midwest. üò∑
Colorado was nice, but I lived in the Denver Metro area and they have a huge homeless problem. Homeless people everywhere, especially Venezuelas. There's people living in tents all over the place. 

The Venezuelas really bothered me because there were a lot of women and children on the streets. I just don't understand how they got there, or why they are there if there's nowhere to put them. Like why were they brought there to live in tents... 

They also go door to door with their kids asking for money. Its annoying. I was also warned by locals to not open the door because it could be bait. Also, alot normal homeless all drugged up everywhere throwing up lol.

I think the area is far more accepting of homeless people. I remember the sprouts near me would always have homeless people inside the store just sitting on the ground asking for money lol. I guess the stores don't mind? 

Im just saying I live in Baltimore now and there's way more homeless people throwing up on the sidewalk in Denver than in Baltimore lol
Moved from NJ to CO 6 years ago, and it is the best decision I‚Äôve ever made. People are so genuinely kind, the weather is amazing, and there is always something free and outdoorsy to do. There‚Äôs so much transparency from our state government, and elections are extremely free and fair (I think every state should have a [Blue Book](https://leg.colorado.gov/content/initiatives/initiatives-blue-book-overview/ballot-information-booklet-blue-book)) 

Cost of living is about 20-40% cheaper, depending on where in NJ you‚Äôre coming from / where in CO you‚Äôre going. Food is getting much better, but you still have to hunt a bit to find the best spots. Oh, and rush hour is still only an hour here. PMs are open if you have any other questions :)
It's a nice place to live , but the taxes are completely out of control. It does balance out some with housing costing less.

Here are some things you should be aware of: 

1. State income tax is surprisingly high. I pay slightly less in state income taxes than federal income taxes (not including SS and Medicare). By slightly less, I mean like $20 less/pay period. 

2. Car insurance is ridiculous high. My policy in NJ was $1,200/year for full coverage. When I called progressive to transfer my coverage they told me my new premium would be $3,400/year for the same policy... I thought it was ridiculous, so I tried shopping around, but didn't find much better and ended up gutting my policy and still pay $600/year more than I did in NJ. 

3. Thinking about moving here and not transferring your vehicle to avoid the high premium? Well guess what? You have 60 days to transfer your vehicle to get a credit for the taxes you paid when you purchased your vehicle. If you don't transfer within that 60 days, you will be taxed 6% of the current value of your vehicle.  On top of that it costs $167/year to register your vehicle, and all vehicles must pass a safety inspection that costs $100 by a mechanic that will spend 2 hours finding every little thing on your vehicle they can quote you for, then you have 30 days to get the work done or it will be another $100. 

These are the few things I've found annoying since moving here.
Oh it's really safe to travel. Very very low crime rates and as an American, very budget friendly. Definitely go. Went last year and I couldn't believe how many Americans and British people were there now. A lot have relocated there because of the cost of living and other benefits (free healthcare) and because of the influx, they have to tighten requirements for people to become residents.

Oh and I hear ya on the current state of things. It's one of the reasons we are pursuing dual citizenship.
My in-laws did it. They retired in their late forties, scaled down to an apartment here in jersey and live half half here and Portugal. (They do have 2 small rental apartments and lived off that small income) Still doing it too. Going on 40 years now
I always felt that way about New York, too, but then I started taking a bus in, once or twice a month on a weekday. So fast to get in, I walk everywhere I go once I'm there, always something new and exciting to see, great way to walk 8-10 miles without even realizing it.
You will find places you like, places you don‚Äôt, but you won‚Äôt magically just happen upon your footing. That takes some amount of good effort applied to the right circumstances‚Äîwhat amount of each depends on the timing. There will be times when you give the effort and the circumstances should be good, but your timing is just off. That is typically only clear after the fact.

It can be frustrating‚Äîyou‚Äôll rarely be able to see past the hood, but if you stare too long in the rearview you‚Äôll see practically everything and forget to focus ahead of you.
Funny, that's the story of how I ended up in New Jersey.
The Acela corridor bubble is well-known outside of the Acela corridor. The media bias towards NYC-LA-DC is also a well-known phenomenon. Clearly you have not lived elsewhere enough to gain this perspective. 

I didn‚Äôt say people were assholes‚Äîassholes exist everywhere‚Äîbut it is perhaps telling that you assumed that is what I said.
Unfortunately, you‚Äôll have to work a lot anywhere you live for the most part. But you‚Äôre at a great place in your life where you can see other parts of the world and determine where most feels home to you. You can always move back!
This could be said of any place, so take this commenter's claim with a grain of salt. It can be hard to make new friends in adulthood anywhere, and people are focused on their own lives and wary of strangers and interactions all over the place (even in NJ). 

What many people don't realize about making friends in adulthood and in new places is that you have to show up to the same place and with the same people regularly and consistently over time for it to happen. How do you think you made friends growing up? You showed up to school or practice or whatever every day or week and over time the people around you sifted out until you had the people you call friends. That's how it works anywhere. (Rare is the lightning in a bottle long term friendship.) NJ is not magically different than AZ. Any place that you aren't familiar with will *feel* different if you are inflexible and give people ‚Äústranger‚Äù vibes by acting like a person from some other place. That is human nature.
I mean go where you‚Äôre happier. You‚Äôve obviously thought about leaving. Go take some trips, see where you‚Äôd be happier. That‚Äôs what matters
it really depends on what is important for you and where you are in life

I'd probably do the carolinas personally.
Someone who never lived anywhere else for over 50 years isn‚Äôt going to have perspective about the place they never left. They want their old routines and familiarity. That‚Äôs fine for them‚Äîthey clearly do not like change or novelty and cannot imagine why anyone else would reasonably be different‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not fine for someone who is not even 20. You will end up with a fixed and inflexible perspective if you stay in the same exact routines with the same exact expectations for half a century.
I'd look for a peaceful spot in Jersey.
Not a lock down for sure, but we have good weather for those who enjoy all 4 seasons.  socal for sure has better temps overall, but they also like to burn down regularly and you might have the earth decide your city no longer needs to exist on any given day.
Just ‚Äúoh and just fyi ‚Äú in the car after picking us up.


So guys bc of scorps n stuff just don‚Äôt leave any doors open.  Check shoes. No purses n stuff on the ground‚Äî‚Äî
Ok‚Ä¶..

And they glow under blacklight so at night shine this in the bushes and they scatter‚Äî-

But usually you don‚Äôt have to go to the hospital‚Äî
I wanna to go home
Vineland is‚Ä¶ not great. It‚Äôs not a place to be a young adult, single, and without friends, that‚Äôs for sure.
It is but my grandma is a widow and isn‚Äôt ready to move although she wants to and my uncle is looking for something he can‚Äôt afford because he wants to move back to his home town not just nj
It definitely made it a very lonely and strange experience living there! I felt like I was in an alternate reality or something lol
Don‚Äôt forget subs I feel like nj is supreme on sandwiches
> Colorado was nice, but I lived in the Denver Metro area and they have a huge homeless problem.

I went to Denver last year and I know that there are homeless in major cities but I was honestly shocked HOW MANY were just on the streets. It's probably one of the worst cities I've seen with the clusters of it.
You don‚Äôt miss the ocean?
Glad it has worked out for you and thanks. I love the Boulder City area but was thinking a bit away from it around Arvada. I know the summers are amazing but a little worried about the winter months. I have family around there so been there several times but just as a tourist. 

The things that concern me is healthcare but Denver is not too far. 

The housing has gone up a bit but I would be looking for something small so shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.
I was down for the income tax due to lower housing prices but that car stuff is not my kind of pain in the ass. Many thanks for the plethora of information, friend. you have changed my trajectory for the better.
Thanks so much for the info! :) as far as travel ‚Äúdanger‚Äù I meant here in the USA! Scary.
üíÄ irony
That‚Äôs the outlook I am trying to have right now only thing I want to end up with is a cabin for myself far from anything else
Yeah true cause making friends is harder when interacting isn‚Äôt really forced + your new to an area
Sc is pretty nice
Atlantic highlands and allamuchy are too expensive
San Diego hasn‚Äôt been on fire or destroyed by earthquakes that I can recall. From what I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs got more than a fair share of wealthy, corporatist pricks, but that‚Äôs separate matter from weather and natural disasters.
Yeah all 4 seasons is a good way to put it
Didn‚Äôt know they glow that‚Äôs crazy
That aligns with the expression of west coast ppl are nice but not kind while the opposite is true here.
I have to assume you‚Äôve never been to New Orleans. Go have a fried shrimp po‚Äôboy, fully dressed (or any po‚Äôboy if shrimp ain‚Äôt your thing) and a muffuletta. New Jersey isn‚Äôt alone in proper sandwiches (and there are plenty here that are a total disgrace).
Yeah it's unreal lol
Boulder is truly something else - will never forget the first time I came over that hill on 36 and saw the flatirons :). 

Arvada is lovely - you may want to consider Westminster or Broomfield as well. Both are about 15-20 minutes from Denver and Boulder, and 30 minutes from the airport. It‚Äôs a really beautiful + safe area, with tons of amenities / activities and a great sense of community. They are building a LOT of housing which has helped keep prices reasonable. 

In my experience, the winters here are much milder than NJ. It‚Äôs a dry cold which doesn‚Äôt have the same ‚Äúbone chilling‚Äù effect as you get with the humidity out east. CO definitely gets more snow, but the winter sunshine means it melts within a day or two (get a south facing driveway and you‚Äôll never have to shovel). Daytime highs regularly get into the 50s/60s in the coldest months (tomorrow is going to be 75¬∞).
Ha! Yeah that too. I‚Äôm Asian, born and raised in Jersey and one time took a road trip with my best friends (one white other is Puerto Rican) cross country. Car broke down somewhere in Alabama and had to stay overnight getting it repaired. Locals made it known they didn‚Äôt want us there. They were cool with my white friend but me and my other friend stayed in the motel all day.
Nothing ironic about having perspective of a place by living outside of that place. Nothing ironic about not using a term and being told you did. However, it *is* ironic that you would smugly label it as such without knowing what irony is.
I will say I was in San Diego last spring and it was great.  it appears they get earthquakes but not quite as bad as most of the west coast.
Right??? All this aside though I hope you figure out what your heart wants. Perhaps think of why you felt it to begin with, why so many of us commented‚Ä¶we are a special kind of people here in Jersey. And as ironic as it may be considering are the butt of many a joke and considered an armpit and def don‚Äôt have some of the beauty other places do‚Ä¶it really is special here. I know I‚Äôd be sad to see you go!! But if you need a bagel dealer if you do leave‚Ä¶I gotchu

Besides‚Ä¶you‚Äôll be back. They alllllllllways come back. 

One rule tho you can‚Äôt go tellin all our secrets. We don‚Äôt want ppl to know the truth üòÇüòÇ
Ha, guess I never saw it this way. For a new fellow NJ who's learning and loving this state a little more everyday, thank you.
Can‚Äôt wait.  Once the responsibilities are taken care of, I would surely live there for an extended duration before I sell everything in NJ. Thanks for sharing your views.
Yeah Alabama üòèI‚Äôm sorry you experienced that. The world is quite disheartening. I‚Äôm a preschool teacher. I feel like this is one giant classroom of children who don‚Äôt understand how to play well with others. That being said, children can learn.

What are the pros of living in North Jersey?,"I grew up in Ocean county, lived in Mercer county, Middlesex county, Warren county and Hunterdon county for different parts of my life. 

I spent one year living in Passaic county. 

Can somebody explain what the pros of living in North Jersey are? The cost of living is very high compared to the rest of the state and there is a lot of people and traffic. Also, retail shopping closes on Sunday in Bergen County.

Is it the proximity to New York City? I also understand that people might have family history there and inherited houses, I'm more talking about people who choose to move there. Is there more work to be found?

I admit that I'm more of an introverted person so a dense population isn't appealing to me. I could chalk that part up to preference. But I can say I don't think the infrastructure is able to allow for the amount of people that live in the region.


I'm defining North Jersey in this context as the Greater New York City region. (Bergen, lower Passaic, Essex, Union, Hudson counties)


TLDR I personally find North Jersey to be overcrowded and expensive. I would like to know reasons why people would choose to move there.",0.61,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jihd40/what_are_the_pros_of_living_in_north_jersey/,57,1jihd40,2025-03-24 03:12,"The NYC job market

Better access to top tier hospitals/doctors

A lot of walkable towns (ie: I can leave my house and walk to multiple restaurants/bars or run to a deli to pick things up at the last second rather than driving to the grocery store)

Better public schools (for the most part)
Better food, close to literally everything. Growing up here builds thicker skin. I love it here. But I‚Äôm also okay with getting the fuck out lol.
I grew up in Morris County on the border of Passaic County. I could walk to the end of my street and catch a bus and be in New York City in less than an hour. There were plenty of good places to shop and eat. Schools were excellent and there was a hospital in town.¬†

About 40 years ago I moved to Hunterdon. Commuting into the city sucks. Commuting to work usually means an hour on Rt 78 and/or 287. Shopping & the hospital are at least a 20 minute drive. But I love it. The pace of life is slower. We have good schools, and plenty of good doctors.

¬†
Partially depends on if you mean ‚Äúthe counties near manhattan‚Äù, or actual northern New Jersey.  There‚Äôs really nice rural areas out here while still having decent access to the city and big towns and good hospitals. It‚Äôs not all crowded.  It‚Äôs all *expensive*, but not all crowded.
If you think if North Jersey is crowded, you need to explore more of it, especially if your only experience is Passaic and probably in the southeast corner where it actually is denser but not exactly crowded (except the highway traffic).

Better schools, more diverse communities and cuisine, proximity to the mountains and the Water Gap, gentrification.

Not to bash, but those with the means to move to North Jersey tend to do so. The majority aren't exactly flocking to South Jersey.
Accessibility especially near NYC and a lot more money flowing through‚Ä¶ easy to tap in and scale.
I prefer central jersey you can be in the city in 40 minutes on the North East corridor and we still have plenty of good restaurants and doctors. And you are only 40-60 minutes to the shore instead of almost 2 hours.
The only reason anyone is here is the NYC job market. And that‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs so expensive.
I guess it‚Äôs just a preference. I worked in manhattan for 20 years. The commute isn‚Äôt too bad for a high paying job.
We have this great pork product that you just can‚Äôt find anywhere by where you grew up. Its called Taylor Ham. I think you‚Äôll like it.
Good schools, great food options (Good Italian, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Mediterranean, etc.), diversity, and proximity to the NYC are some things I can think of. Besides, like others have mentioned you have access to good paying jobs in the city, so commute to the city also one of the reasons.
It feels like a ski resort in the winter. Lots of places with hills for¬†Hiking. Close to nyc, upstate ny, pa,.¬†
I grew up in Bergen, lived in Passaic and then back to Bergen. In 2005 I moved to Mercer County. My whole family lives in Bergen and there is zero way I would go back. The homes are so close, the traffic is horrific and every single thing they have there is here. Furthermore if I need to go there I drive 45 minutes and boom I‚Äôm there.
I bought a house in North Jersey after living in Brooklyn for 15 years. For me, it‚Äôs the proximity to work. My commute to Midtown from my new home is shorter now than when I lived in the city. 

I also enjoy being close to my friends, hobbies, and the fact that the restaurants in my town are delicious (and BYOB!). I like that most of my neighbors are liberal, we have lots of trees and parks, and have excellent municipal services.
The food ! Easy access to transportation
Proximity to NY if you work. NYC cost of living makes North Jersey seem somewhat affordable, though that seems to be going away more and more
It‚Äôs not south Jersey
The main reason NNJ, Westchester Long Island, and parts of CT are currently high costs of living is the career  opportunities offered in NYC, primarily Manhattan.   Many of these major NYC suburbs are unlike other US city suburbs and some may be considered cities themselves in other parts of the country.

Countless people from all over have finished school and moved to NYC for work over the decades. The newly arrived young are tolerant with apartment sharing and spending most of their discretionary income on all the fun and games the ""big city"" can offer.  Many transplants stay within their inner city comfort zone for years learning nothing about the greater suburban areas until they start a family of their own.

Those who stayed in NYC long enough partner up and have kids eventually need more living space.  They would prefer a large duplex, brownstone, or other massively expensive home to raise their kids in, but - they are smart enough to understand they can not afford that option - so they can either bail on NYC and find a job/home in a lower cost of living locale - or stay and find a larger, single family home within a NYC commutable zone.

They go to NNJ and realize they may not be able to get everything they had in Manhattan, but they can still get a hell of a lot more than whatever little was available in the god forsaken, backwater of the world they themselves originally grew up in.  Plus they get better public schools than NYC for ""free"" if they don't want to/can't shell out for private K-12 tuition.

They then come out and compete for real estate in NNJ with the people that were born and raised there - many barely setting foot in NYC most of their lives.  These long term transplants are the NJ residents that tend to move back to Ohio, or some other place they grew up in, immediately after their last kid graduates from a NJ high school.  You don't get that cultural vitality, and economic competition, in areas outside the daily commutable zone to Manhattan.
Access to New York City for jobs and entertainment. One of the reasons my husband and I want to stay near here is because we like going to Broadway a few times a year. That would be a lot harder from another area.
I have the same Q.
Closer to many hiking trails in NNJ, NY and PA
It's not South Jersey.
Depends where on the state you live but in general: about an hour away from two major cities, beaches, mountains, great state for shopping, decent mass transportation, good job market, and a lot of amazing restaurants.
Food
That‚Äôs amazing and Ridgewood is so beautiful. It. was always well heeled, I remember a girlfriend of mine in HS dated a guy from there and before she got her license se we would have to take the train to journal square before Ridgewood, and this was way back in 2009  around Christmas and the decorations and town were decorated so beautifully, it seemed so idyllic. For you to buy there in 2017 is a steal and you won out. I really loved the home we looked at. So she sent me some other listings to look at. I swear everyone‚Äôs home is so beautiful and so tastefully decorated. I was really impressed.
The food and NYC‚Ä¶that‚Äôs all.

I disagree with public transportation‚Ä¶most towns are very car dependent. Passaic to Hackensack was a TWO HOUR commute for me.
As others have mentioned the close proximity to NYC is an asset especially if you are pursuing a career in the arts or finance.
I don't need a car, there are fewer ""Toms River"" types, and there's more than 2-3 different food cultures.
It's the job market for us.
1. It's very peaceful in my opinion¬†
2. Crime is very low/rare
I totally grew thicker skin when I lived in Passaic. Especially driving. I needed to get pretty aggressive with it to maintain some space on the roads around there. 

And then I moved to Hunterdon County and I needed to tone it down lol 

I find it interesting in North Jersey people treat the shoulder as its own lane as an entrance to highways, but in the rest of the state, the shoulder is simply a place to pull over in emergencies.
This is it. East Rutherford is half way between Boston and DC. It's also in the NY metro area. North Jersey is one of the most convenient places to live ever.
Agreed. For me, the cost / benefit ratio is rapidly tipping toward moving, especially that I‚Äôm approaching retirement age
Hunterdon County is beautiful. It‚Äôs cheaper too. What  are they doing in Flemington Boro? I hear the project is a complete nightmare, not planned Or well thought out. and it‚Äôs going to be a wedding hall with a ‚Äúboutique‚Äù hotel and it‚Äôs now on year 18?! For the Union!!?? I remember thinking, they are just gonna turn it into an overpriced wedding venue. So I‚Äôm not surprised. Somerville revitalized their entire downtown in half that time, a total bust. I‚Äôm so disappointed. Cute down, destroyed by greed‚Ä¶ shocker.
Yes, I currently live in Hunterdon County. (Frenchtown) So, I'm on the complete opposite edge of the state than NNJ. Definitely too rural for me so I won't be staying, but I like the vibe in general.
Tell me more about counties near Manhattan not being actual North Jersey? You better leave Essex outta this ü§®
Yes, when I lived in Passaic I would regularly go to the northeast tip of the state near the upstate NY border and it is very quiet and rural. I liked that. It is very expensive though. I lived in Warren county for a while and I got those same vibes for a lot less money.
Central Jersey seems to be growing with quite insane prices similar to some I‚Äôve seen in Bergen. Literal garbage 2 bed 1.5 bath older ‚Äútownhomes‚Äù going for 450k - 500k I also wasn‚Äôt aware that Montgomery was flooded with so many well to do families. My girlfriend is in her late 30s  after working close to 20 years in the city she is over it and just sold her condo in Hoboken and is  currently viewing homes in Ridgewood. I met with her Saturday for lunch and invited me to look at a home with her. It was beautiful, the price was already unreal and her realtor said. ‚ÄúIf you know you love it and want it, get ready to fight for it. ‚Äú 
She said, Im not planning on going over budget, ad and the realtor said well than knock 200k off your initial budget because that‚Äôs what someone can easily afford to do here. The wealth in this state is sometimes overwhelming to me. 

I‚Äôm by no means in the poorhouse, but I got lucky on a sea shanty shack in foreclosure in Manahawkin and purchased it for 130k, as a ‚Äúshore house‚Äù, it needed to be torn down. I remember being newly married and so stressed over how the hell we weren‚Äôt going to go into foreclosure ourselves after we got it, the home was worth nothing  for about 8 years.  I feel like made it when it was just assessed at 1.4. On the Lagoon. Sometimes real estate is about just sheer luck and timing. However, I have no idea how Gen Z can afford to eat and keep their lights on as well as pay their rent/mortgage. It‚Äôs going to be completely unaffordable here, it makes me sad to think about anyone who loves this state and has to move because of the cost of EVERYTHING. I don‚Äôt see how our economy has even held on for this long.
If I were going to move to South Jersey I might as well move to Florida. Every time I go there for vacation it seems the only opportunities for anyone there is shore jobs. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people close to Philly commute there for work and back, but at that point I‚Äôd just move to a Philly suburb and cut my taxes. This is coming from the perspective of someone who doesn‚Äôt have a family home/generational wealth here.
And it only takes sitting in 20 minutes of traffic to go 5 miles.
This is my general takeaway from this thread.
I met my best friend in fairlawn and oh boy. Have we had the discussions over these little meat discs üòÇüòÇüòÇ

I put BIGGEST point of contention is Quick Check versus Wawa.
Close is a pretty loose term here.But it is drivable at least
I should have defined what I think North Jersey is. I'm more talking about the greater New York City region. I lived in Warren county for a while and would go to Sussex for hiking and I know legit skiing resorts exist up there too.
I like Morris county too! I should have defined what I think North Jersey is better. I'm generally talking about the Greater New York City area
I was looking to buy from 2015~2017 and looked at Ridgewood. Even then, the prices were high for the time but affordable if HHI was at least 120k. Now the downtown is full of yuppies and new apt complexes went up. You're right on with Central too. The supply goes up but it's not cheap and single family home prices go even higher because ""well it's better than living with neighbors in a building"". Yea, but the house needs a 200k reno so people settle for the 650k LUXURY condo or 3000/month rental.

Something has got to give, but mark my words. I ain't crossing the NJ Mason Dixon Line (Toms River) üò≠
That's North Jersey
What is close to you?
Ohhhh yeah do NOT go to Jersey City, it's absolutely horrible.¬†
Northeast, maybe. Most of my CNJ experience is Woodbridge, Edison, etc ‚Äî so, I may not have the full experience. If that‚Äôs considered NNJ I‚Äôm going to start calling Perth Amboy the shore.
I mean I'm an hour and a half to Philly closer than North Jersey but I wouldn't really consider it close close I think under an hour is close
And you think the traffic is that bad there? I take 18 and 1 pretty often. 18 isn't great because of the construction but as long as you don't drive from like 4.30-6pm everything moves
Ok but are you closer to nyc and upstate ny and pa?
No you are closer to NYC. But the other 2 upstate new York and pa you are closer but still not close
Over the border. We refer to over the border as upstate ny lol then specify Hudson valley

Pa is still just over the border¬†
I guess it depends on where you are in NJ and where you are going in PA and NY both are massive states. And I'm biased since I can't sit in the car for more than an hour and a half."

My question specifically is about **(3) Copy of fully executed tariff**; and **(4) Statement of Financial Condition - Profit and Loss Statement for most recent 12-month accounting period**

For #3 I understand that the tariff is our general price list but what makes it **fully executed**? Is it just that I have to certify on the document, signed and dated?

For #4 - I'm not an accountant, book-keeper, CPA etc, I'd consider hiring one but at these early stages I don't feel that it's necessary to have. I do have the basics recorded like Gross Revenue, Labor expenses, and other business expenses (advertising, equipment, fixed costs like truck payments, insurance, storage rental, etc) - my question here is....how ""official"" looking does this P&L statement need to look? Can it be just a basic spreadsheet or pdf file showing my income vs expenses or is there some official P&L format I should be following?

Newark airport,"Hey I‚Äôm flying on Wednesday from Newark and my flight is at 10pm since it‚Äôs a red eye how early should I get to the airport? I don‚Äôt want to get there too early but wanted to know how the traffic is like that late at night
",0.4,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jif03g/newark_airport/,7,1jif03g,2025-03-24 01:07,"2 hours domestic, 3 hours international. From my experience Newark is hit or miss‚Äî you either move fast through TSA or you‚Äôre at a standstill‚Ä¶ with no rhyme or reason. Flights coming and going all day/night. Better to be early than late.
Earliest 7pm, comfortable with 2, 1.5 i wouldn't be sweating, 1 I'm checking my watch a lot. Traffic shouldn't be bad depending how far you're coming from, 7pm arrival would be already post rush hour.
I would highly recommend at least 2 hours early at the bare minimum, but just to be safe, I'd recommend 3 hours.  Airport customs and security are tough in that sometimes, the lines move super fast, and other times, they can take an extremely long time, and 3 hours gives you plenty of buffer room just in case anything goes wrong.  Newark Airport's also extremely busy because a lot of New Yorkers will use it too, so it's almost always busy, so I think being cautious by going earlier helps
Sound advice already on this thread - 2hrs domestic & 3 for international for reasons given.

The ‚Äòhalf hour arrival before boarding‚Äô folks - may Jesus look out for you. That‚Äôs playing with fire.
Just note tsa precheck closes by 8pm depending on the terminal
Not me arriving to Newark with usually ~30 min to spare before boarding ü´£
Seriously! Granted, I have TSA precheck but things move pretty quick. If you are getting dropped at the terminal, it's simple. If you have to park in long term parking and take the  Air Train, especially to terminal A, it takes a bit longer. I would get there:
-2 hours for international 
-1.5 hours if I was checking a bag domestic 
-1 hour for domestic carry on

Just be prepared for traffic on your route. That would make me more nervous than inside the airport."

Aaa!!! Omg i absolutely can help u, I kno all the places, the key is not finding just a jersey bagel, our best bagels here are ones that are made and boiled fresh in Brooklyn and then baked fresh here in NJ, a lot of our bagel places are breads and bagels from NY Brooklyn or Staten Island. And never in your life will u ever have a better bagel anyplace else in this country. I literally can‚Äôt ever leave here because of the food we got in our area, and for the fact that we arent afraid of eating the bread!!!
Rockland Bakery in NY might ship? I can‚Äôt vouch for their bagels but they do make them wholesale
Katz deli in New York ships. I tried to send bagels out of state and realized was too iffy if shipping even first class. Sent bagels and other thing to family. They were beyond happy.
New York Water Bagel Co in Toms River....
And imported gelato ü§å
Huh? I‚Äôm not familiar
I tell ppl not to send food.ill glut when i visit lol
what makes them outstanding? I live about 15 minutes from them, might head over there tomorrow morning.
I looked and they look so small and soft compared to what I had before. The bagels I had were HUGE compared to bagged ones and they had such a nice texture and were soft as pillows
Yes!  Or Bagel World

This place is fantastic
I live in teaneck where there are plenty of bagel shops, but this one is still my favorite. They're always fresh even after 12pm, since they open at 5am most days. They even make mini bagels which my kids loved growing up. 
I found this place because my in laws used to live very close by.
You have to find the right seller on Goldbelly. They don't have just one bagel shop. 

Try the Bagel Nook in Freehold, NJ. They are pretty decent for what's available online. 

In the end, the best bagels are bought fresh from local spots that have a neon ""HOT BAGELS"" sign, and you aren't going to find them on goldbelly.
Ess a bagel are one of the best in NYC
West Hills Deli in Hillsdale, NJ are exactly this, huge, soft, and delicious. Unfortunately, I don't think they ship orders.
Yes!

Always busy in the summer - normal during the winter. Best bagels in that area by far, IMO
Bagel nook makes trash bagels- though fun cream cheeses and good coffee. Theyre known for their creative varieties, but as far as run of the mill bagels go, you‚Äôre getting something about as good as what you‚Äôd get at Panera. They‚Äôre seriously the worst bagels in the area. There even replaced a decent bagel shop in pond road.
Literally the next state overüòÇ probably about 2 dozen, a random variety
I gotta hit them up one of these days. It has been a long, long time since I have had one of their bagels. It's easily been 15+ years.
Totally agree. But they're like one of the only sellers from NJ on goldbelly. That site sucks anyway. 

OP might as well order from St. Viateur in Montr√©al if they're ordering online. They're one of the very first bagel shops in North America, baked in the original wood burning stove."
EZ pass violations sent to collections,"Hi everyone, 

I commute to work on the turnpike, and I got a new debit card, and forgot to update it on my ez pass account. Every time I went through the toll there was a $50 fee, totaling a few hundred dollars before I realized. I recently got a letter in the mail that the violations have been sent to collections.  

I just logged into my account, and was able to pay the bill. I updated my card and sent up auto payment. 

What is the likelihood this will affect my credit score? I was still able to pay on the ez pass website. Also I have not received any mail/calls from a collections agency.

Not included:  Bill Spadea and Ed Durr both being MAGA goons, with Spadea being a special kind of batshit hateful.
Durr- expand coal. I mean that alone is a no vote.
The republican side is so comically stereotypical on every issue, I can't get over it.
Thank you for this! By the way, while I was googling more info I found Republican Jack Ciattarelli is [up Trump & Musks butts.](https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/03/trump-and-musk-meet-with-nj-gop-candidate-in-governors-race-at-bedminster-golf-club.html)
I registered as a Democrat only to vote against Phil Murray in the primaries eight years ago. Well, whatever. I like Baraka's idea to unify school districts but think it should be taken one step further and include towns.

I live where six towns have individual school and local government districts, plus donut towns, but have a regional high school district. About 95-99% of our issues are the same. We all waste money on seperate school systems and governments.

There are plenty of examples.of larger regional districts making up one larger one where local voices are heard but the larger districts, by volume,  can purchase supplies in addition to consolidation administration costs
Lol Ed Durr. No fucking chance.
 Can I just say thank you for posting this. Very helpful to see this in a chart.
Spadea‚Äôs climate skepticism is reason enough to drop him from consideration.
Garbage in. Garbage out. (Bashing on nytimes, not you)

My priority is to defend our freedoms and ensure our jersey way of life from the federal regime, so for me it has to be either Fulop or Baraka. Just watch the first debate and you will see they were the only ones with real backbone.

Edit:

Debate can be watched here

https://www.youtube.com/live/Q0tkWTtau2w
Just curious where all these guys saying they will cut taxes plan to find money to pay for all of the other things they are promising.
Based on this chart (obviously I‚Äôm going to do more research), Baraka and Fulop are looking like the best candidates.
fuck AI
Bill Spadea is such a shit head. I am obviously voting dem. But it any republican wins, I hope it‚Äôs Bramnick.
I love how the collective Republican stance to solving the housing crisis is basically a ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø emoticon.
Voting Blue regardless
bro, I'm trans just tell me which ones don't want me dead
Whens the next debate?
The only plus I see under the republicans is that they want to expand nuclear energy. So many people are terrified of anything with the word ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù in it, but it‚Äôs really a safe and clean alternative to fossil fuels.
every Republican position is garbage
These Republicans are fucking chaotic evil.  Like what the fuck.
This is amazing. Thank you to whomever took the time to do this.
Wish any/all candidates would support banning HOA but the greed lures all
Did you double-check for accuracy? AI has made big strides on the hallucination front but I still wouldn't trust it to be accurate without being completely sure. It saves time on the content generation front but we still need to be it's editor.
Fulop
I like both Fulop and Baraka based on what‚Äôs here. Fulop pulls ahead for me in a few key topics.
It's unfortunate that only a single candidate mentioned they want to ban cellphones in classrooms. This should be a no-brainer

Incidentally, we also need to do something about kids using AI for all of their homework...
I think we‚Äôre getting a Shit Sandwich here.   
  
By the way, Gottheimer kept pushing that ‚Äúonly one with a plan to cut property taxes‚Äù but his ENTIRE plan rests on New York State willingly giving up the payroll taxes they collect on each of us who live in NJ but our employers are in NY. Sure‚Ä¶NY State is going to give up billions in tax dollars and not put up a fight. SMH
i really hope a strong democratic leader wins so nj is atleast protected against the MAGA adminstration even in the slightest
Honestly the most nonpartisan table I‚Äôve ever seen for this race
I‚Äôll wait for a real writer/reporter that actually spends time with these candidates to give me summaries of their stances on issues
Until they can cut wasteful spending by towns and force small towns to merge, then nothing regarding out property tax is going to improve
Is there any detail behind lowering property taxes by 15%?
What is their stance on Medicaid and long-term care for people with autism? New Jersey has historically been one of the better states for people with autism. Which of these candidates will try and keep it that way (and which ones won't)?
I mean you could have stopped with the Democrats.  All the cultists have the same bad plans for our state.
Steves sweeneys $400 check is a Lucille Bluth moment.
This is a great cheat sheet
People are gonna get really confused when they see candidates on the ballot in November who were strangely absent from this NYT article. 

I wonder why they didn't interview Zielinski
Reading all of the comments, here, and just general Dem research, my wonder and worry is if the split votes between Baraka and Fulop will guarantee Sherrill the Primary win. She's getting overwhelming support from the centrists and moderates.
I wish energy was a big point. It should be up there with housing imo. Everyone‚Äôs utility prices have been crazy recently and this is before the summer PSEG rate increase that‚Äôs coming. We import our energy, so our costs are always going to be beholden to factors that the state can‚Äôt control. They need to rein in PSEG, or commit to new efficient energy like nuclear since it‚Äôs clear the offshore wind is not helping.
My one question to every candidate, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs paying for this?‚Äù
Last time i saw a matrix like this. Murphy lined up with everything i wanted, then proceeded to either do fuckall for it or actively go against it
Thank you for sharing!!!
Have any of the candidates addressed telework for state workers? Would love to remain hybrid

Reading all these comments, I really want to know what are the best candidates. 

After all if we only mention the idiots, then the intelligent people will never get name recognition.
Thank you for this! Super helpful.
vote Ras in the primary and NEVER any Republican in the general
I think I‚Äôll go with Ras, I feel like Newark has a decent control on rent, Fulop is a cool second choice but rents in Jersey City are high. I have a friend paying 6k for rent
Josh Gottheimer is your favorite scum bag elitist‚Äôs favorite politician
Baraka, Fulop, and Gottheimer are in a 3 way tie for me. Gottheimer would need a more detailed transit plan. NONE of the republicans seem appealing at all!

Need more transit oriented development around the train stations, bus terminals, and already built up areas. Adjust zoning to reduce front and side yard setbacks. Too many rotting eyesore properties that are impossible to build on because the zoning setbacks mean that you could barely fit a garden shed on the site. 

No holding anyone any longer than normal for immigration. If they want an individual they better hurry up. All law-abiding immigrants should be put on a Path To Citizenship. Most of them currently face the issue that it would take decades to ‚Äúdo it the right way‚Äù due to extraordinarily low annual limits on immigration with a 5% or 7% cap per country so it would take decades or even a century to immigrate legally. It is so bad that the young children of legal immigrants including Foreign Diplomats are aging out and being deported before they could reach the end of the waitlist. 

Abortions are a decision between the pregnant person and their doctor. Attempts to delay it result in disasters in emergency situations because ‚Äúto protect the life of the mother‚Äù exceptions are too arbitrary. Almost every ‚Äúlate term abortion‚Äù is the result of actual deadly medical complications. Similarly, ‚Äúrape case exemptions‚Äù are difficult to use because so few rape cases result in a conviction much less a sentence so proving it is a rape is a lengthy and arbitrary decision. The state also needs a stockpile of day-after and abortion pills due to attempts at the Federal level and courts to ban them keep happening daily. 

All of the transit agencies need in-house experts with an allowables list to do the work now instead of having to wait and bid it leading to further delays and cascading cost increases. The bus services should be consolidated with NJ Transit. PATCO and PATH would be very messy to consolidate because of the extent of the lines that are in PA or NY. All of the agencies need a type of SeeClickFix system to report issues and get them fixed and a customer support line available during all operating hours. If an escalator or elevator is down, they would report it on the site and the transit agency would provide repair updates or a plan for major needed repairs. 

For Affordability and Schools, the towns and school districts need to be consolidated. Recombine the donut-hole towns and the strings of little adjacent beach towns. So many separate towns and school districts means more paid administrators for every department and lots of unnecessary additional paperwork and legal fees. Use the savings to stop tax increases and possibly lower taxes. New Jersey also needs to fight for our fair share of Federal funds. We consistently have some of the LOWEST returns on our federal dollars. [Gottheimer is all over this issue](https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/2024/05/09/nj-red-states-federal-investment-grants-josh-gottheimer/73611228007/)

We need a lot more investments in solar and wind power. Offshore wind turbines would be so far that you barely see them and the bird death issue is miniscule compared with fossil fuel plants, windows, or cats. They should take care to REDUCE bird deaths and new blade designs and color schemes make them into more of a deterrent for birds, while the foundations each become artificial reefs!
Are we all in agreement that Steve Sweeney can go fuck himself? If there's one thing the right and left can agree on it should be that
Folks I know in JC say Fulop can be a bully to staff and he vibed with the County machine until he calculated that he would be better positioned as an ‚Äúoutsider ‚Äú candidate. I‚Äôm going with Baraka. Let the Trump resistance begin with his election! Remember only NJ and Virginia elect governors this year. Often sited as a bellwether for the Midterms.
I decided on Sean Spiller.
I see everybody attacking republicans candidates in all seriousness is there anybody up there that actually has good policies and is not just following what there party is doing?
i'm voting for Baraka.
Why even include the Republicans in this Subreddit lol
Seems like there should be an 'R' after his name.....  What a tool.
The Gottheimer guarantee: no more homework!
Exactly! I thought the same of the Transit thing with refunding delayed passengers. Cancelled trains, maybe, but delayed? That's insane! 

We have a funding problem for NJ transit where we can barely fund it as is and he is saying we are going to refund people now? How are we supposed to pay for that?

The other candidates are actually bringing up reasonable things and he is just overpromising cool things that have 0 chance of happening ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Interesting, I'm living out of the state now (but still own house there and it's my primary residence in the US, so I could vote), but haven't been following much. Based on this chart alone Gottheimer seems like the best choice by far.
I think that comes off in this chart...
Fuck Spadea. 55+ can benefit from living in a town with good schools but don‚Äôt have to pay a penny for it. Big shock that he‚Äôs 55‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

So it‚Äôs off topic, but every time I see that asshole‚Äôs name I‚Äôm reminded of a congenital condition called hypospadias. I will forever associate that  with ratfucking loser with misaligned dick holes.
Yeah Spadea is a psychopath. Listening to one episode of his show would show you that he's not fit to lead. 

Every bullshit conspiracy Trump spouts he buys into. He's no better than the idiots who drive around Monmouth County in Trump RVs. 

My dad still has some weird habit of keeping 101.5 on in the car even though he thinks the MAGA cult is insane. So I've heard enough of Spadea to know where he stands on every hot topic. The guy fully believes schools are indoctrinating kids through drag shows and they want kids to ""become"" trans. He's a hateful nut job.

Unfortunately that is going to resonate with a lot of people. Especially because he already had a massive platform and followers.
Don't leave Jack-off that list too. He's promising to work with Trump because Dems are still too worried about pronouns to get anything done (of course I'm paraphrasing because I was trying to avoid the ad as much as possible).
D or R
DO NOT VOTE FOR BILL SPADEA
I just saw a commercial for (I don't even know who or what it was for actually). But the whole commercial was saying why people shouldn't vote for Spadea because he's such an anti-trump person. 

It seemed like the whole commercial was written to make it look like he was against Trump when he's actually for him. 

I hope others saw that commercial so they can explain it better.
I saw an ad saying Bill Spadea isn‚Äôt Trump-sucking ENOUGH. I laughed out loud.
Is anyone else considering changing their registration to republican to try to skew the primary results?
For a second, I read this as you making a sarcastic comment about how stupid expanding coal is instead of his actual name.
Why are they all so fucking stupid? What happened to them? They are all braindead
Truly earning the Shitarelli moniker.
The consolidation of townships absolutely needs to happen but honestly I don't ever see it coming to fruition. There's too much ego and money at stake and nobody wants to be the town that gets cannibalized
I find it interesting that Baraka was the only one who wants caps on rent increases,  which i think will really help the housing issue.   When someone like me with a college degree and a healthcare job in a hospital can only afford rent in a shitbox in a bad neighborhood,  that's a big problem. 

That and they have the same name as a Mortal Kombat character,  so that's pretty cool.
Agreed. Which do you think has a better shot against the repugnicans?
Is there already a date for the primary debates?
Only one who isn't a fucking psycho
Fulop, Baraka, Spiller are (in that order) the D candidates I'd expect to actually stand up for trans rights
Right? This is lacking an equal rights column.
That‚Äôs gonna be Fulop. He held two zoom meetings with the trans community already. In JC he extended gender affirming insurance coverage to employees in 2015! I have a trans son, and I‚Äôm actually volunteering to get him elected for this reason.
Left side of the chart is what you're looking for
Baraka's City, Newark, celebrates Pride for the entirety of June *and* July every year.

Pretty cool to get two months of events
Any of the D at this point.


Anyone who wants to enshrine abortion rights in the Constitution is also going to not really care about you being trans either.
^^^^
Lol, none of them want you dead.
Yup and one of the great things about NJ is that we actually have local schools - there‚Äôs a reason we‚Äôve been in the top 5 best school system among US states for years now‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm not too eager to go into a larger county based or charter school model

Aren‚Äôt cellphones already banned in classrooms? That‚Äôs been a school rule that‚Äôs just very difficult to enforce since forever, idk how it‚Äôs going to be any easier to enforce coming from the government
Parents need to parent, schools need to block access to AI, and there needs to be a complete cultural shift regarding the value of learning and education. That begins with cell phones and getting kids under 16 off social media. It‚Äôs destroying their attention spans and their ability to be intrinsically motivated to learn. Their reward-centers are being destroyed by 30 second dopamine hits on TikTok.

This. A million times this. Just as an example, Essex County would be the 18th largest city in the U.S. (same size as San Francisco!) if all its municipalities merged. Huge economies of scale if you could run the city well.
Consolidating school district and maybe a county fire and police?
Gottheimer plan: 1/3 municipal cuts, 1/3 state level cuts, 1/3 sue NYS. Not realistic.
It's an empty promise, dude is just gonna throw his hands up and blame the legislature for not following ""his plan"" because it would totally screw the budget and would completely derail his other plan of full day kindergarten, since schools are funded primarily through property taxes.
It's literally in the same vain as class president wanting to give everyone free pizza and ice cream, nice for votes, but it isn't actually going to happen.
It's Gottheimer.... 'nuff said.
For the love of god please do not rely on garbage AI regurgitating a single article to determine your vote. Do your own independent research from multiple verified sources
It looks like her campaign is losing momentum. She doesn‚Äôt do well in debates and she‚Äôs now sending a surrogate (McKeon).
This exactly. ""ability to govern"" needs to be column 1. Only Fulup has that qualification.
We're lucky someone took the time to do this much. Do your research and you'll be able to determine which candidate's shade goes with your eyes.
I don‚Äôt think Ras can win in Nov.
Different markets. JC is 15 minutes away from NYC.
Saw him speak a couple weeks ago in Paramus. Really impressed with his platform and even more so with his enthusiasm. 

Sadly there are too many MAGA bigots in NJ.  It is not yet time for a black governor (even though I think he would be a great one).
That‚Äôs not his bio. He has been running outside of the political machine most of his career.
Baraka doesnt bully staff because he has zero control over any of them. Call newark city hall about an issue and watch it never get addressed. Ever.
That‚Äôs a false narrative
Really? I generally don‚Äôt care about county conventions and their endorsements. But Spiller only got 24 votes and that‚Äôs his homebase. The man has zero momentum.
Fulop
November‚Ä¶ Durr is out as of today.
Democrats aren‚Äôt a monolith. Speaking as someone living in his district, if he didn‚Äôt run a more conservative democratic campaign, he‚Äôd lose to the republicans. Our district was represented by the Republicans from 1933 until he beat Scott Garret in 2016 and even though we‚Äôre rated D+4 we still only just barely swing for democrats in Presidential and statewide elections. Our district went for Murphy in 2021 by 1% 50-49, Harris 50-48 and Kim 51-47. Despite those razor thin margins for democrats in our district, Gottheimer has held his seat since he was elected in 2016 and even in 2022 and 2024 he won it by a margin of 10-11%.
> We have a funding problem for NJ transit where we can barely fund it as is and he is saying we are going to refund people now? How are we supposed to pay for that?  

Probably from the $100M/year paid to Amtrak that he would hold back (per this document).
Really? Lower taxes means cutting services. You can't have it both ways.
Especially where Spadea says he fully supports trump‚Äôs immigration policy.
People in my town say this bullshit, it drives me nuts, they also think renters use the schools for free, completely ignoring the fact that rental homes have property taxes too, which is passed through on rent.
Good to know I'm not the only person whose mind immediately made that association.
I don‚Äôt have kids, does that mean I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay property taxes (not that I‚Äôm a homeowner, but hypothetically)? No, because an educated populace benefits everyone. And there are definitely 55 year olds who still have kids in the school system.
I have an extreme hatred for people who benefit from the system and then once they no longer need the system, vote to get rid of it.
Thats Jack‚Äôs campaign. Trying to win over the Trump crowd by saying Spadea isn‚Äôt Trumpy enough.  As others have said, Jack has had a Trumpy streak himself.
The thought briefly crossed my mind but I'm not sure who I would want to see at the top of the republican ticket. Also thinking it might be more important to focus on the best democrat, since the party leadership tends to screw that up.
Omg me too I was so confused
They are trying to win a Republican primary. It's a race to the bottom of a hole the winner will have to pretend they didn't really mean to enthusiastically dig.
>What happened to them?

Ronald Wilson Reagan
Ever since I first heard of him, that's just how I read his name.
Interesting to see Fulop is the only one wanting to crack down on corporate landlords (at least stated here).  Would be smart for more Dem candidates to pick up on this. I don‚Äôt know anyone who would oppose it except corporate landlords.
Rent control is not a good policy and will only serve to make the housing crisis worse. The only real solution is to build more dense housing. Rents went down in Austin and Minneapolis for that reason.
Rent control doesn't help the housing crisis.
Just because Fulop didn‚Äôt say it, doesn‚Äôt mean he wouldn‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm guessing candidates were asked to give something back in writing? What I know of Fulop is that he is extremely responsive to majority opinion.  He enjoys being on the right side of history and on the right side of an argument. If this is something he was asked to consider and implement he probably would do it.  Like last year, he was asked to reconsider his endorsement of Tammy Murphy. And he did. And he switched to Andy Kim. He‚Äôs very good like that.
Someone with a concrete plan to bring rent down would probably take the election pretty handily. Capping increases is great, but we are already paying way too much as it is.
Rent control is horrible policy that will only make the housing crisis worse. This been studied endlessly, and I‚Äôm glad the other candidates are not economically ignorant enough to support it
My town has rent control and our rent has only gone up about $100 over the last 5 years.
They are equally ranked for me atm
I added an edit with a link to the debate
NYT doesn't consider that a consequential issue unfortunately
Gottheimer won't defend trans people. He won't send out goosesteppers, but he won't pursue protection at the same rate as any of the others, if at all.
I would take any of the D's but Mikie Sherril has been a disappointment. Better than what we had but she's not willing to stand up against Trump in any kind of way. If she's the nominee I'll vote for her but not my favorite.
shut up
Because the GOP keeps attacking education and education funding?
The GOP has consistently made it harder for teachers to do their jobs, no wonder!
There is one republican that isn't batshit insane. The rest are obvious fucking morons. Clearly you went to the shitty school the republicans would have the next generation attend
Literally everything except charter schools and nuclear power is a garbage position.
Too many parents want cell phones in the classroom unfortunately. ‚ÄúWhat happens if my kid needs to reach me‚Äù 

Until that mindset gets changed we won‚Äôt see improvement
Which means lots of Red Staters coming here‚Äîand we just got the state to the right point where they‚Äôre all dying to get out.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. The people living here would greatly dislike it
That was the plan in the 1920s...to merge most of the County into Newark..   There were similar plans for Elizabeth , Paterson , Hackensack which have annexed most of the surrounding towns.
Fulop said it best at a debate. In response to Josh‚Ä¶ if it was so easy to cut taxes, Phil Murphy would‚Äôve done it. Nuff said. Josh is empty promises.
Sorry, I saw a spreadsheet and couldn't help myself imagine how beautiful it would be with some conditional formatting. It is excellent work as it is. üòï
So because NYC is 15 minutes away that justifies a reason to have 6k rent? 

Rent next to one of the  busiest transit stations in the country isn‚Äôt even that high.
As a resident of JC, it‚Äôs the same here too. Total incompetence across many JC city departments that Fulop leads. Hard pass on him.
This is categorically false. Speaking as someone else who lives in his district, Josh Gottheimer is a power-hungry maniac who sued a constituent (a friend of mine) for making a joke. He wants to be more conservative, he doesn't have to be-- and he has the money to run whatever campaign he wants to in CD-5 and still win. He foams at the mouth in excitement every time a Palestinian kid is murdered. The man loves genocide and hates the working class. Gottheimer is EASILY the most dangerous person running for this office (yeah even worse than most of the Republicans), and he has a long history of ignoring his constituents completely.
Like I said I'm only going off of that chart and don't know his whole policy. I don't think we should lower taxes without making up for the funds elsewhere, but I would prefer to raise the state income tax to offset the property tax decrease.
That‚Äôs a great point. Lots of people have kids in their late 30s. Again, shocking that the arbitrary age he chose happens to align with his own. He‚Äôs a self-serving POS.
They should really make those ads illegal. 

You know the ones where they say that the ad was sponsored by some generic name group that we know is clearly sponsored by another candidate.
I grew up under Christie Whitman and she wasn't a bad governor
It is fitting. He is a Grade A douchebag for sure.
Same here!
Agreed.   I think the housing crisis would be pretty much fixed with rent caps and not allowing corporate landlords to own single-family homes.  If i ever sell my home, there is no way I'm selling to a flipper or business.  You buy my house, you'd best be living in it.
Fulop has enabled corporate landlords his entire time as mayor. Bullshit.
https://jwmason.org/slackwire/considerations-on-rent-control/ there is evidence that rent control does reduce the amount of rentals by condo conversions but doesn't reduce the amount being built and it does keep prices under control even for non  rent controlled units.
How do you figure that rent control won't work?
oh thanks, I had absolutely no idea the debate already happened. I'm pretty up to date on more national politics, but when it comes to local politics I just don't know as much cuz all the journalist, scientists, professors, educators, etc that I do follow only report on most national stuff.
To me Mike Sherrill doesn‚Äôt feel genuine. Very political answers, a lot of bullshit. Idk
Who is your first choice?
Yeah - she voted for the NDAA and HR 30
Ras Baraka is so much better than Mikey Sherril. I think she's turning to the other side. I get a bad feeling from her. Like she sold her soul. Ras is on our side. The side of the people.
Agreed, but she also doesn't want trans people dead.

Personally I like Baraka but I'm more of a fan of normal people who run for government than I am of bankers who turn politician.
üòÜ
[deleted]
Charter schools are terrible too
Yep. It‚Äôs terrible.
Always has been...
My point being supply, demand and location and can‚Äôt compare downtown JC to downtown Newark. Also there are units far below 6k in JC.
I did not hear about the lawsuit over a joke.  Can you provide any more info or links? I looked for it using perplexity.ai and came up empty.
_______

>He foams at the mouth in excitement every time a Palestinian kid is murdered.

Completely agree.  He was key in the U.S. pulling funding from the [UNWRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA).  They fund the [World Central Kitchen](https://wck.org/) among other groups.  The UNWRAs' horrible act that turned Gottheimer against them?  They had the nerve to provide humanitarian aid to Gazan victims.  Gottheimer hates Palastinians so much that he does not care if hundreds of thousands go hungry elsewhere in the world.
I can‚Äôt find anything about him suing a constituent. Do you have more on this?

Money doesn‚Äôt automatically win an election. Stephen Sweeney proved that when he lost his state Senate to that whacko Ed Durr. Like it or not our district, even if it leans democrats, doesn‚Äôt lean  very progressive.

And really? He loves genocide? Is your proof that after the October 7 massacre his response was ‚Äúthe US should stand with Israel against terrorism‚Äù instead of ‚Äúnow let‚Äôs make sure to think about systemic oppression and consider that Palestinians are just vocalizing concerns over zionazi oppression when crowds of them cheer the massacre of Jewish citizens and videos of Hamas atrocities.‚Äù

Also to call him more dangerous than most republicans running when all but 1 of them are fighting each other over who‚Äôs the biggest supporter of every part of Trump‚Äôs agenda is insane.

I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs my first pick for the democratic candidate but goddamn he‚Äôs not literally Hitler or something.
You live out of state, of course you don't want to pay property taxes on a property that you don't primarily live at.  Property taxes being higher help prevent people from buying homes in areas that they don't intend on living in.  New Jersey has good educational systems that's in-part to our high property taxes.  So personally I don't mind paying higher property taxes if it means that wealthy people won't come in and buy all of our housing.
You‚Äôre right. She wasn‚Äôt a bad governor. She was a  terrible governor.
idk her wikipedia page is pretty crazy
My personal opinion: Whitman's decision to stop paying into the public workers pension (a strategy that subsequent NJ governors continued) I feel caused more harm to this state than any other single decision any NJ governor has made since.
Whitman is almost single handedly responsible for the skyrocketing Property Taxes! Her income tax cuts starved towns of funding so property taxes had to increase to make up the difference.
I met him during the last governor election, I was on the fence about voting for Murphy again, and after meeting Jack, Murphy had my vote.
I met him because he visited my job, and was introduced to our shop steward, who you could see just wanted Jack to fuck off.
Unfortunately there are also too many people that have money who buy up houses or use the extra ones they have as an investment or rent out and charge high rent as a way to make more money. It isn't just corporations doing this. Whether a corporation or a single individual I don't feel anyone should be allowed to use any additional homes they own as a way to make money while the person renting it has little hope of being able to save up to one day own one. Just because this is legal doesn't mean it's ethical and hopefully there is at least a limit on this in the future because so many corporations are buying up these houses and screwing over people that just want to own a decent home to live in.
Good person.
 Bad link. Please re-post usable link. Thanks!
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-does-economic-evidence-tell-us-about-the-effects-of-rent-control/#:~:text=Rent%20control%20appears%20to%20help%20affordability%20in%20the%20short%20run,an%20interest%20in%20this%20article.&text=The%20Brookings%20Institution%20is%20committed%20to%20quality%2C%20independence%2C%20and%20impact.
Rent control being a bad idea is one of the few things you can get a large majority of economists (of all stripes, not just Chicago school) to agree on. Thay and that tariffs are bad.
it doesn't attack the root cause with the supply and demand of housing, it rewards individuals simply for being the lucky ones who get housing before others, and it doesn't incentivize individuals with controlled rent to increase housing in their area because they don't feel the impact of housing shortages.
It‚Äôs not that it doesn‚Äôt work per se, but has some bad side effects. 

Who is building more housing under rent control?  You‚Äôll never fix your supply problem, you are just masking it. 

These policies often let rentals reset after tenants leave. So you end up with people who can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt move, which restricts options for new entrants to the markets. 

It lowers the value of all units in the rent controlled area, even if they are not rent controlled. 

In some cities that enacted it, like Cambridge, they saw a lot of units fall into disrepair during the rent control years, and then saw reinvestment after the laws were lifted.
Rent control disincentivizes housing construction because the ROI is now being capped. Cities that have rent control typically have less affordable housing than nearby areas because of this. 

Rent control only benefits existing renters. You‚Äôd be better off trying to incentivize construction than capping rent.
Yep agree
Still investigating but I live in Sherril's district and she's not it. Fulop or Baraka I guess but we need someone who is going to win. Trump is already meeting with republican candidates (maybe just one idk) in Bedminster and I'm afraid the fix is already for this race too. If Sherril has the best chance then I'll hold my nose and vote for her.
Ras Baraka, I love how he stood up to ICE when they tried to come into Newark. He is tough. We need tough
Do you think Ras Baraka can win?
I like Baraka but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as strong as Fulop.
I would not trust her on trans issues. She voted for the NDAA which denied gender affirming care for military families‚Äô kids. And here is the kicker-she didn‚Äôt have to vote for that bill. It would have passed without her vote. So I think she was sending a message. Fulop is the best on this issue. As mayor of JC he extended employee insurance coverage for gender affirming care. And that was in 2015!
Well maybe she doesn't want trans people dead but I also think she wouldnt stand up for them.She's not standing up for any of us now and when I call to ask why that is I get a lot of bullshit or voicemail. I don't think she can be  counted on. 

Edited. So many mistakes the first time lol.
And its public schools are consistently ranked top 5 in the nation.
So it sounds like it's working if dismissing shitty stances on education out of hand is their position.
Means that in spite of their efforts, we're still managing to get something positive done. If you want to see what education looks like in states with full GOP control, look at Oklahoma and Mississippi. I don't think we'd want to emulate them.
No they aren't, they work fantastic in Philly.
Yes but income can fluctuate through a person's life, while property tax only ever goes up. Graduated income tax is the only moral tax in my opinion.
Thank you! I agree that not paying into that fund was the start of a tragic amount of harm to state employees but, as one of the last self described ""Rockefeller Republicans"", her governorship is a lot more interesting. She was actually on the shortlist to be W's Vice President until a shocking photo of her patting down a kid from Camden got released a few days before their convention
I can't find any graph of Property Taxes in NJ that proves your point.
I will be honest, I am not a Murphy fan. He handled COVID really well, but beyond that, I am just...meh. But when it comes to Shitarelli, I would vote for a piece of pork roll before I voted for him.
try it now
Ok,  then after reading that, perhaps a temporary rate freeze.   I'm just tired of seeing landlords raise rent to absurd levels and keeping people out of homes while so many other places sit empty for years.
Saw an idea somewhere that said ""5 year tax abatement (not including township school taxes) on new multifamily dwellings that have rent 10% below county average"" or something like that. I can get behind that (numbers have to work out to make the incentives worth it to builders) but the thought process is that it drives the average down due to new units and better pricing. And to have an immediate help to people looking to rent you do a credit system where instead of forcing the building of low income rentals you directly fund the monthly rent a certain percentage (that's more complex and would require a bunch of logistics but I never liked the forced low income housing stuff due to how it was implemented anyway)
> Rent control disincentivizes housing construction because the ROI is now being capped. Cities that have rent control typically have less affordable housing than nearby areas because of this. 

Does that hold true anymore with everywhere getting expensive over the last 5 years? I mean affordable housing construction already has been disincentivized by the demand for a higher return by the builder/developer which is why large McMansions are being built in Vernon and Wichita, Kansas.
>  Cities that have rent control typically have less affordable housing than nearby areas because of this. 

Newark has rent control. Is rent cheaper in Newark or Montclair?
I liked some of Fulops responses in the article but he seems like he has a history of being borderline corrupt. Curious what your thoughts on some of his controversies are? 

I think my favorite so far is Baraka. Admittedly still feeling a bit overwhelmed by so many choices and trying to educate more.
YES!!! He's the only one with balls. He has no problem standing up to Trump! He's very popular in Newark. He needs to get himself out more to the burbs. Yes, he can and needs to win
Baraka is my #1 + Fulop #2. Just a year ago I'd have no problem saying Baraka could win the general, but the 2024 election really made me reassess the NJ electorate. In south Jersey, Sweeney has big standing, and while he may have been a run of the mill Dem in the 90s, he's essentially just a moderate squish Republican in 2025. He's dead in the primary, but his popularity among south Jersey Dems is an indicator for where the non-dem SJ population is. 

Before November, I'd have no trouble imagining NJ voters elect a progressive black man. But now, I can just see the racist ads and false accusations of antisemitism and smears about radical socialism.

Morality doesn't pay my teacher paycheck. I teach everyone, including the poor kids. Don't I deserve to get paid? Do you think I should take a smaller paycheck because they can't afford the taxes?

I thought his first term was ... fine, which is why I was on the fence, but after meeting Jack (sorry too lazy to type Shitarelli multiple times) I realized that regardless of how I was disappointed by the lack of fulfilling promises made during his, Murphy, campaign I couldn't in good conscience vote for Jack. Dude was talking about wanting to bust unions, IN A UNION SHOP, to union members.
Got it! Thx
Cap tax increases and rent.

Capping one but not the other will lead to issues.
There is no solution other than building more. Nothing else works, it's just wish-casting.
I encourage you to attend a meet and greet and hear Fulop live. He is not borderline corrupt.  Unless he‚Äôs an unbelievable actor. Which I don‚Äôt think he is. Lol. He‚Äôs really down to earth, honest, relatable guy. When you sit down and talk to him, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre talking to your next-door neighbor. It‚Äôs crazy what the media can get you to believe about someone that you‚Äôve never met.
Bro what I liked Fulop. Where is this corruption you speak of?
Where did I say cut education? I said replace the lost income from reducing property tax by increasing state income tax. While we're at it let's stop using property tax to find schools at all and have all schools funded at the state level so your quality of education isn't dictated by your zip code
I miss the days when the Teamsters would have tarred and feathered people like that.
I definitely don‚Äôt wholeheartedly believe that which is why I was hoping some commenters might be able to shed some light but there have been a few iffy moments for him politically at the very least. 

Im still trying to get a good grasp of the candidates and definitely keeping an open mind on him.
He‚Äôs not. Don‚Äôt trust me. Trust yourself.  Go to a meet and greet and talk to him. You will definitely like the guy.
https://emilyslist.org/news/sound-the-alarm-mayor-fulop-has-a-long-history-of-corruption-in-new-jersey/
Or make up with an increase for second home owners and people who don't occupy their property as a primary residence instead of off people's incomes in state.

Ewing is very close. The area near The College of New Jersey is nice and safe. You'll have a choice of a few grocery stores, various restaurants, etc.  You can also hop a quick train ride into Philadelphia from the West Trenton station.
Is this the Capital Health on Hamilton Ave in Trenton city or the Hopewell capital heath? Bordentown city has a younger crowd, I‚Äôd also suggest Lambertville but that‚Äôs 30 mins north

Ewing by State Police, not too close to TCNJ as rent gets inflated, Hopewell,Hopewell Borough both very nice.  Pennington. Hell even Lambertville is not that far, and has lots to do.

I will be working at both - mostly at Hopewell
Ewing would be the perfect location to rent then. Just stay away from the areas bordering Trenton.
Off topic, but I was born at the one on Brunswick Pike üòä

Some parts of Trenton aren't bad and not all of the parts of Ewing near Trenton are bad. In terms of Ewing, I would specifically stay away from anything along Ingham St, Princeton Ave, or Calhoun St along the border with Trenton, which is really close to where you will work. I wouldn't want to live right on Parkway Ave especially around the intersection of Parkway and Pennington, but it's fine once you get a block away from Parkway. Nobody will bother you but you want a bit of a buffer zone to catch the stray bullets.

emissions inspection help,I need to get my emissions tested since my sticker is expiring this month. I am currently attending college in NY and so I was wondering if it was possible to get it done out of state? My boyfriend is an arizona resident in NY and his vehicle was inspected with no issues in new york state. He just had to mail them proof and they mailed back a sticker. Wondering if NJ does something similar or if I have to make the trek home by the end of the month to do it. Thank you.,0.67,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1ji4xz7/emissions_inspection_help/,3,1ji4xz7,2025-03-23 17:42,"Great question. The answer is in the FAQs for inspections.

You should get one when you come back to NJ, it‚Äôs quick and free at the NJ state ones. Just make sure to get the out of state inspection before your current sticker expires."

Moving to Florida by Car,"I‚Äôm going to be moving to Florida soon and taking only the belongings that will fit into my hatchback.

Any suggestions on route, schedule and place to rest? Do I unload valuables from the car when I stop to sleep? Some items are bulky and a pain to unload/load. 
Should I just sleep in the car? 

I did the drive once in one shot taking turns with my sister and stopping for food and restrooms, but I ended up driving 70% of the time, if not more. 
At some points towards the end I was pushing my luck fighting against sleep, which makes me nervous about attempting doing it again in one shot.

It picks you and your car up outside DC at like 3pm and drops off in Orlando around 9am. Save mileage, gas and time, plus skip the hotel. I believe it‚Äôs ran by Amtrak.
Cover your items with a black plastic or fabric put a sign that says highly toxic if touched seek medical attention immediately!
second vote for auto train!
The AutoTrain is currently having a sale.  I believe the last check in for the AutoTrain is 2 pm.  We've driven many times.  Am near Exit 3 of the turnpike, but we don't use it as 295 is close and does not have tolls.  I would usually try to make it to Pooler Ga. on the first day.  There are quite a few hotels near Pooler and exits above and below.  Avoid the Sleep Inn at Pooler - was run down and looked like they stopped performing maintenance a long time ago.  Hopefully you have an EZPass.  There are tolls above Baltimore on I95 (express lanes) and at the tunnels.  EZPass also works in Florida too for their toll roads. Make sure your license plate and vehicle are listed on your account.
I've done this drive solo (but in the opposite direction), in a Scion xB with a small Uhaul trailer. This was about 13 years ago; it took maybe 36-40 hours total, most of that on i95. 

I didn't stop at motels/hotels, just slept at rest areas when I needed to, had food/drinks with me, and never had any issues. I used [this as a guide](https://www.i95exitguide.com/rest-areas/) to the rest areas, and never felt unsafe (and this was as a woman in her mid 20s at the time). It helps that I had done this trip multiple times, so I already knew where my preferred rest areas/gas stations were.

Just FYI, Georgia only has three rest areas (2 southbound, 1 northbound). If you miss any of them, you're waiting until the next state, so if you're feeling tired and you're close to one, stop there.
Stay at a hotel with security cameras.
I learned about car break ins at certain hotels by reading the reviews. Same for safe hotels - in the reviews. Then make a reservation and you‚Äôre good to go.
Thanks for all the input, I went with the Amtrak Auto Train. Currently waiting to load the car.
I didn‚Äôt even this was an option!

We stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Florence, SC when we travel from NJ to FL. We moved our stuff in a U Haul and I had the same worry but it was fine. We have stayed there many times. It‚Äôs right off 95.
Pick whatever roadside motel you see in the Carolinas when you start getting tired. Park your car near the motel front office.

If you've got anything important like medications or your mom's ashes, I'd probably bring them into the room with you.
I did this 2 years ago. NJ to central FL and still here. except I had my cat and we did the drive over 3 days. had a pet-friendly hotel room for both nights booked in advance. I had a 40‚Äù TV with me in a TV moving box that I brought into the hotel each night because I was paranoid about someone breaking into my vehicle for it.


the one thing I would do differently is bring a cooler with some food and drinks for when I get to my hotel.
What part of Florida?
If you know your address in florida and there's someone there who can receive packages for you, pack up your stuff and ship it to florida by UPS.

It usually leaves around 5pm from Lorton, VA, and arrives in Sanford, FL, around 9am the next morning.
We do this every other year going to disneyworld. It's more money than driving/hotel, but you get dinner/breakfast and relax/sleep.

We usually get the sleeper car cause you get a bed to sleep instead of sleeping in a seat that can't recline.
I will also be smearing poop all over it. Gotta make it believable.
Yes.  Florence is a great half way point and what we do as well.  There are two Florence exits.  Make sure you stay at the one with the convention center.  Safer exit.  Lots of nice hotels and chain restaurants to grab a bite to eat (we always run across street to chilis).  Gas station right there to refill in morn.  Good luck.

Towns in Central Jersey that are not outrageously expensive?,"Hi

I grew up in Bergen County and currently live in Texas. I'd like to move back to North Jersey but the COL is just too high for us that the numbers don't work out. There are 3 bedroom homes that would cost $250k in MCOL cities that are listed in the $800s in Bergen County.

We checked out Cherry Hill and Voorhees which have good school, young families, suburban areas, and are more affordable than north jersey. Do you have recs for Central Jersey? Ideally with good schools and young families and are sleepy suburbs?

  
EDIT: I wasn't clear about the pricing. I know no place in NJ is $250k. I was just trying to emphasize the stark contrast in housing costs. Our budget is closer to $750k.

Do you mean South Jersey?  Because those areas are South Jersey.
Central Jersey or South Jersey? You mention south Jersey towns
Take a look at Morris County. Specifically the western parts towns like Wharton, Roxbury... some affordable place there, you're not going to be at 350k though unless it totally fixer upper.
Edison is nuts. Mostly because it‚Äôs like the Hamptons to Indian immigrants. My 3 bedroom is estimated at like 850k and it‚Äôs nuts because it‚Äôs just a 3 bed ranch from the ‚Äò60s.
What's with everybody in the country moving to Jersey? Don't people realize the state is at capacity, hence the skyrocketing home prices that just keep going up!
You want to move from an enormous state with terrible schools to the most densely populated state with some of the best schools. Of course the prices are way higher, you get what you pay for.
Honestly, you need to look to Sussex County, or South Jersey if you want affordable.

The schools here overall are much better than in Texas. I taught in rural Texas and inner city New Jersey. The quality in inner city NJ was much better.
no help on towns but just wanted to let you know - wife and I just went through the same crisis. Left Columbus, OH where we had a nice home for like 350k and that same thing here is 800k+. 

  
Just kind of have to accept it if you can afford it and sacrifice elsewhere - the schools are so good everywhere Monmouth County and above. We ended up buying in Manalapan but it was about 850k.
3 bed in a good school in Central Jersey in a sleepy (ish) town will run you $600k. Not new.
Central Jersey is a broad area, i‚Äôd argue anywhere from between i80 and i195. 
Old Bridge, East Brunswick comes to mind meeting your criteria. ‚Äúoutrageously expensive‚Äù category would be basking ridge, holmdel, manalapan, marlboro
The equation posed has no solution.
You can get a fine home in Bergen county for 750k. Maybe you're not getting what you want for the money.
North Brunswick, Franklin Twp./Somerset, East Brunswick seem to have some 3 bedrooms under 500k and quite good schools 

Piscataway great schools :)

All close to New Brunswick/Edison for rail access

I would do a price search on Redfin/Zillow and see what you come up with then search for school district rankings

Check out Mercer County. Also Chesterfield and Mansfield in northern Burlington.
Look around somerset county around Bound Brook and Piscataway.

You need to manage your expectations on price and wait until you hear about taxes.
West Windsor/princeton junction comes to mind but you‚Äôre still paying $600k+
Cherry Hill is quite congested and expensive because of its proximity to Philadelphia. A lot of people live in the Jersey burbs and work in the city - just like the northeast areas of the state.
None.
$250K for a 3 bedroom?
Keyport, Union Beach, Keansburg?
Plainfield hillside roselle Elizabeth
Exactly.  Money equals good education in the USA.  Higher property tax-base, more money for education. Will only worsen with the dismantling of the BOE
There‚Äôs no such thing as not expensive in NJ for the most part. Even in areas where the schools are okay vs good it‚Äôs still expensive.
Yep- moved to Mount Olive a few years ago and we love it. Prices are higher but not too crazy.
Send him to Sayreville,¬† Helmeta, Spotswood.¬†¬†
600K in Princeton Junction is a starter home.  Try $850-1 mil for the average home.  Schools here are in the top 5 in the state as well
20 years ago maybe
They are looking for good schools.
Fair point. That's what we've been learning. Want good housing costs, give up schools. Want good schools, pay up.
Kendall Park section of South Brunswick Township. 
Sand Hill Rd. or New Rd areas. Maybe Brunswick Acres?
They have a great magnet high school they can go to, and Elizabeth doesn‚Äôt have bad schools, plus any other good schools in central Jersey will be in places with very very expensive prices

I hope my local Walgreens isn't impacted. Say what you will about corporate blah blahs -- the pharmacist at my local Walgreens literally saved my life just by being kind when I needed it.
I don‚Äôt get it. If I remember correctly 2012-2020 a bunch of new Walgreens were built. I have seen this same thing happen before. Company expands at a dramatic pace to the point where it seems like a new one is on every other block. Then they close them. I‚Äôm not in business but it seems that a more conservative expansion would make sense.
The Clinton one is the one that burned down I think. Sounds like it won‚Äôt be coming back.
Kinda called this. The moment they started pushing their own credit cards I knew the end was near. I‚Äôm surprised Best Buy has held out as long as it has despite doing similar.
Hopefully it's one near me. It's useless. Worst pharmacy in the world. Worst everything.
Shame because they are one one  of the few  companies to  not remove DEI
My local Walgreens is a dump and last time I went the cashier was on their phone, then looked annoyed I was there, didn't say hi or anything, and when my chip didn't work made it seem like my fault and was somehow even more annoyed. Never went back.
Its not surprising. 

I worked at a local Walgreens for a few months in 2023 and never understood just why it bothers pretending to be a conveninece store. 

Constant excess supplies stashed in the backroom. Useless or excessive protection against thefts. Higher prices for items that you can get cheaper at other grocery stores. So much films being wasted on photographs that were never picked up. Shit rewards system and even shittier credit card. All around huge waste of money and poor incentives to attract customers
One near me turned into a spirit halloween last fall. Feels like a bad sign.
There are 3 Walgreens within 5 miles of me, plus a couple CVS, a Walmart, and several supermarkets with their own pharmacies. And a couple mom & pop pharmacies (surprisingly enough). And I do not live in a high population area, though there is a sizeable number of seniors. So I gotta figure at least one of those has to be on the chopping block.
Damn the one in Clinton is closing down. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm gunna be drowning at work. I mean can‚Äôt complain more business but means we need more staff. I called it once that place got burned down, I don‚Äôt even know why they tried to bother telling everyone for over a year yes we are rebuilding, with what money? Hopefully the one in Whitehouse doesn‚Äôt close ü§û

![gif](giphy|dAbwIpLeH9yEeYXnRw)
I‚Äôm wondering if the main thing keeping these chains afloat, when there is a pharmacy in every major grocery store and Walmart, is sweetheart deals with insurance companies. I know CVS is literally owned by Aetna, or vice versa, so their future is assured.
Walgreens sucked anyway good riddance
To add 1101 Atlantic Ave, Atlantic City 08401 just closed on March 18th.
It‚Äôs difficult to be a kind Walgreens pharmacist you found yourself a gem.
It is but they have been working out of a trailer and rebuilding. I wonder what will go there instead.
Where would we even buy tech if best buy closed, I honestly can't think of another store. Apple for apple products but everything else?
i am shocked more arent closing.  They're all awful stores, and always the worst in the area you find them in. Urban areas will be crazy ghetto, rural areas will be filled with meth heads and rednecks

He sold it back for less than the cost of the raffle ticket?
Thanks for the info. Never really thought anyone actually won them. Guess they do win and just need to pay the tax on it.
That isn't how it works. The dealership usually OFFERS to ""buy it back"" from you for like 30% less than its sticker price. A lot of times there never is a car, and if you actually want it, you have to wait to order it. 

The place that sponsored it (usually the dealer) isn't on the hook for as much dough. Winner gets cash that they can then use to pay the taxes on it and pocket the rest. The italians still get to take a little off the top. Everyone wins.
So, it's a scam

Tbh seems like a good way to do money laundering
Jimmy Hoffa is actually in the trunk, they switch him out each year. Its why they never found a body.
They kept it. For the time, it had all the Bells and whistles.
- accept the car instead of the cash value
- realize you still need to pay taxes on the car
- sell the car to a dealership to pay taxes
- the sale value is less than the tax amount
He would still have had to pay the taxes on the car if he accepted it.
No, that's how taxes work, yes it sucks. Just like people learned after the Oprah giveaway of Pontiac's.
Just because you‚Äôre in waste management everybody assumes your mobbed up
The sale value would never be less than the taxes. It would be taxed as income so somewhere around 25% on average. Do you really think a car dealership would give someone less than 25% of the value of a brand new car?
How on earth could the sale amount be less than the tax amount?
Even if he sold it at a loss (which seems extremely unlikely), wouldn't be then be able to write off that loss?
I still think it's a scam. If the only person who loses is the winner, then I don't know what else yo call it.
The tax is owed on the price of a new car (and depending on how the gift is handled, you may need to pay both income and sales taxes). The sale price is on a used car.¬†

On top of this, if you're not careful and just want to be done with an unwanted gift, you could sell it for a lowball offer before you know the total amount you'll have to pay in taxes.¬†
You realize the winner doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ lose, right?

If you win an 80k car, you‚Äôre going to owe some $20k in taxes (22% fed rate plus state).  That‚Äôs the government at work.

So you can‚Äôt afford the taxes.  Ok, fine.  You are now a distressed seller.  Maybe someone gives you $70k for that car.  It‚Äôs ‚Äúgently used‚Äù after all.

So you pay your taxes and walk off with $50k cash.

You still won.

Or, if you wanted the car, you could take a loan out to cover the taxes and pay it off like a normal car loan.. for much less than you would have paid if you bought it outright.

So that‚Äôs an option too.
>I still think it's a scam. 

You can think that all you want...and you will just be flat out wrong.

> If the only person who loses is the winner, then I don't know what else yo call it.

Your logic is fundamentally incorrect because you do not understand the laws.

The law basically saying the winner pays the taxes on the prize....same as winning big at a casino, racetrack, lottery, etc.

If the case of that person not being able to afford the taxes - they sold the car back to the dealership and did win some money (minus taxes of course) and maybe they bought a cheaper car with that money....or doubled-down and went all in on scratchers.
Reddit is funny, give a respectful informed reply, get down voted because they don't like the honest and accurate info. Fucking idiots.
Three things. First, you're not going to sell the car for a used car price, because you never take delivery of it, the dealership will hold it and sell it as new. Second, even if for some reason you got paid for a used car, you would still make money.

Car is worth $10,000 new, $7,500 used. You pay $750 in sales tax, 25% in income ($2,500) your profit is still $4,250.

Third, if somehow any of that was true and even selling it would cost you money, than you can simply refuse the prize. They can't force you to take possession.
I agree, I wouldn't call it a scam.  You're still gaining from it.  

I don't know if they had this back then, but now there is a law that they have to offer a cash value option for the prize.  It still takes the taxes out of course, but it's at least a better option than getting stuck with the car and the tax bill and having to sell the car on your own.

But yeah, CRock came to mind as well.  Love how it says ""western"" side of NJ.  This is smack dab in the middle.
Judging from the pictures on Google Maps, it's not the one. That one is a tiered style waterfall. I only recently found out about all the different types. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_waterfalls_by_type

The one I saw was more like a plunge style which goes mostly straight down. 

I would also add that it was on a back road. That's what made it such a surprise.
Nope, we went to that one only a few years ago. Nice little hike and there was somebody's gym bag on the grass field there. That was a bit creepy because it was definitely there through at least one rain.
From what I remember it was a natural waterfall coming down out of a forest. I'm still adding this to my list of places. 

A while back I started a list on Google Maps of waterfalls and I'll certainly be adding this and the others that weren't already on it.
You buffoon, I said ""riding TO the Western side.""
Ha, my reading comprehension leaves much to be desired!

But after *rereading* your post, I'm curious if it's [Watchung Village Green](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ktJ8jjKaH6SPiyws7).  I'm definitely interested in the conclusion of this, who doesn't enjoy a scenic waterfall."

Anyone here knows what it costs to farm one acre of land in NJ, and how much revenue one can expect from it? I know it depends on many factors, type of crop, etc, but just a range can help. Am moving from garden farming to production farming, hence looking for some estimates. Any inputs are appreciated.
Mostly raw sun, might put a small greenhouse too. First year farming, am still learning. Do you know anyone that can mentor me?
Are you under the gun with a loan repayment timeline?
No, I'm not. Why do you ask that?
This is very important for anyone interested in helping you. Determines margin at a basic level. What township? Need to know town law.
Sure, that makes a lot of sense u/R3N3G6D3. No loans on it. Township is Cranbury, NJ. Am also looking at some farmlands near Hopewell, NJ. Want to take the mentor's inputs on finalizing the leased land, reviewing the lease terms, considerations for deer fence, water, etc.
Do Hopewell and build a greenhouse, I'll teach you to grow cannabis commercially. Nj has some erratic ass weather recently, a canopy like a greenhouse is the ticket.
Just so you know, my interest is in growing local and specialty vegetable crops. My passion is to offer fresh, healthy, pesticide free produce to my family, friends, and local folks. No interest in cannabis.
Organic pesticide free is an indoor concept. You can't grow outside without pesticides. If you want a profit margin, half an acre nearly enough unless it's a high value crop like cannabis.¬†
u/R3N3G6D3 do you know what it costs to farm half an acre of land including lease cost, seeds, cultivation, labor, fertilizer, compost, harvest, etc - basically an all inclusively cost for a year, and what end profit one can expect? Am referring to growing vegetables, fruits like strawberry, or garlic. I need to do this part-time as I have a fulltime job, hence i need to hire labor, which i believe is the most expensive.

What happened to downsizing? The future appears to be upsizing.,"In the past, I thought people generally bought homes, lived there years,then sold them and downsized later in life. Based on the awful housing market and the fact that the only things being built now are ""luxury"" townhouses for all ages and 3,000 sqft 55+ homes, it seems like the future is actually upsizing. Live your young & mid adult years in a condo or townhouse and then when you turn 55+ you'll finally be able to afford a house...",0.96,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jhxifw/what_happened_to_downsizing_the_future_appears_to/,184,1jhxifw,2025-03-23 11:51,"¬†NJ is so expensive to build the larger houses sell easier because bigger houses look better inside and the builder makes more on the sq footage. Bed rooms are cheap to make kitchen s are expensive.¬†
Part of it, at least, is the same reasons SUVs and trucks keep getting bigger. Builders like them because the margins are higher (especially if it's an open plan -- the buyer's paying extra for air), it's a status thing, and people keep buying them. And i think in both cases, they've managed to engineer the outcome they wanted: build less of the thing you don't want to build, and put less attention into quality or updates, so you can say ""No, we don't build those anymore. Nobody wants them.""
Huge issue too is that these 55+ communities are expensive. My friends parents bought a home in south jersey and it was 600-750k. They sold their huge single family home for 550k just to get in a smaller more expensive place. My parents bought their house in the 90s and it‚Äôs basically paid off it makes no sense to downsize since anything smaller would more be more expensive. We are in this weird housing gridlock. I think we need to create housing zones where only smaller single family homes can be built, they can‚Äôt be bought to rent and if they are sold they can only be sold for 20% of the purchase price or something‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs because people don‚Äôt want to get rid of their stuff so they hold on to more and more crap and need space to accommodate the excess. When my mom died it took so long to go through that stuff that I swore I would not do that to my kids.
I can‚Äôt speak for everyone but I can tell you about my parent‚Äôs experience.  My parents live in a 4 bedroom 2000+ square foot home. It‚Äôs just the two of them now. My Dad is retired and my Mom is trying to work until 65 but I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll ever actually retire fully. 

The house is paid off so they only get their tax bill which I believe is around $13,000 for the year. Their bills have drastically dropped since my siblings and I moved out. They thought about down sizing but then Covid hit and the housing market went bonkers, so they paused on that for now. My mother is also really indecisive about what she wants. 

They used to talk about moving South to retire but that‚Äôs not happening anymore since the grandkids are in NJ and they‚Äôre actually involved in their lives. 

Bottomline they‚Äôre both healthy still, they can afford the home, and they‚Äôre within 15 mins of their grandkids. They‚Äôre not going anywhere anytime soon and if they did they‚Äôd still be in NJ where the tax bill will be relatively high no matter what size the home is. Staying, at the moment, is convenient. When they do move they plan on downsizing to a ranch-style home in the same area.
sounds like monmouth county üòÇ
Housing shortage! Every one of these threads, this, bidding wars, nothing but ‚Äúluxury‚Äù apartments, high rent, the answer is there‚Äôs a giant housing shortage and these problems wouldn‚Äôt be problems if we built enough housing to meet demand. 

NJ is great. Lots of people want to live here. So either we build enough housing or all these problems get worse. Pick one. 

Currently we‚Äôre picking ‚Äúdon‚Äôt build enough, be unaffordable, and give away electoral votes and congressional seats to red states‚Äù. These are policy choices. We can choose to do other things.
Move out of NJ.  I would love to downsize in a few years but it means moving to parts of NJ I don't want to love in.  Easier to just move out of NJ.  Even a decent condo/townhome costs almost as much as a house.
NJ does not have good enough public transit for downsizing in-state.

People like apartment life if and only if it is convenient and easy to get to where they want to be. Very few places in NJ allow this
I‚Äôm old enough to buy into an over 55, but I have no interest. I live in a modest 3/1, and prefer to be in a community with people of all ages. 

I have two kids who live outside of the area so having space to accommodate them when they visit is important to me. 

And if I‚Äôm really honest, existing in a space filled with MAGA hat wearing idiots would likely result in me going to jail.
I live in Essex County and I noticed specifically in my neighborhood that people raise their families in their house and then live there until they either pass or have to move in with their kids.

For example, my house is a what u would call a starter home in 2025 but the woman who lived here before us raised her 5 children in this house and they only sold it when she passed and was in her 80s.¬†
Same with my neighbor, they sold a couple years ago when she passed at age of 90. My other neighbor‚Äôs father built their house and when his parents passed on he kept the house and rents it out. I think for the smaller starter homes the older generation stays in their homes and doesn‚Äôt technically downsize since they are already smaller homes. Then if their children don‚Äôt sell they end up just renting it out. There is definitely a housing shortage, especially for the more modest size homes and when they sell a flipper comes and does a shit ‚Äúremodel‚Äù and resells it for obscene amounts of money.
Part of this is bc houses are supposed to be investments that appreciate. You can‚Äôt build a stable housing market like that period.
I (56F) was ""involuntarily downsized"" due to house fire. Went from a 4-bdr 1/2 acre to a 2-bdr w/garage apartment.

I pay significantly more than my mortgage each month, but without the added costs of home ownership, it comes out to less money  (and stress and hassle). Kids are grown, no yard work, no oil burner, no well water.  I seriously thlught diwnsizing was not an option, but it works. So I guess the universe took care of me, for once.
I know more boomers living in Adult 55 homes that are bigger than the houses they raised their kids in.  It makes no sense.  Why would you want to maintain a house that size?  Why would you want to live in such a huge space with only your spouse?  Do they hate each other that much?
Two critical things have already been mentioned here

Hoarding, and 55+ communities or ""people farms"" as my husband and I call them

We live in ocean county, where there are massive people farms (like holiday city) and we have fatal car accidents so frequently on 37 my husband and I say its a suicide attempt if you even go on it. Hooper and 70 are even worse.

Then you notice how many funeral homes exist in proximity to these people farms and, medical Plaza. This is by design.

Drive toward seaside and you'll notice liquor stores on every block, many simply across the street from the other. Again  this is by design

Keep the population sick alcoholics so they can only afford the people farms and a one way ticket to medical $$$

Now, add in the hoarding mentioned. My mom is a prepper and also hoards romance novels. This will make for an interesting mess to sort through. I'm an army brat, we've lived all over. My mom couldn't accumulate crap the way others do.


My MIL however has lived here 69 years, her entire life. Her basement is stacked with things from the 1950s to now. Fridgerators that done work, musical instruments she can't even play. School desks!!!! From the 50s!!! Stacks of tires, cars rotting in the driveway. And if you dare gently mention hoarding and try to help her it never ends well.
Boomers gonna boom.  The concept of living in a 2mil estate and then downsizing to 2k sqft is nonsensical. And to think I might share a entrance with others... What will my friends and family think? Have I fallen from stardom?  Will they still want to be seen with me? 
Where will the grandkids hang out when they come over once a month.  How are the wife and husband able to occupy the same tiny space when they can barely stand each other any longer?  

Most importantly it's a place to secure your money.  Dunno who will be buying them in twenty years, guess that's for their heirs to decide
Genuine question- why are boomers expected to downsize? I thought we‚Äôre trying to do away with social conservatism.
* Baby boomers are notoriously greedy
* We don't have enough housing supply
* Zoning laws in this state are dumb and bad
* We've outgrown our property tax system and need to move to a land value tax system which uses the value of the land as a greater component to your split/property tax
* Nobody wants anyone to move into the area, poor people don't want rich people, rich people don't want poor people, and nobody wants new neighbors
It's a consumer culture. We have so much stuff that we have storage facilities being built where there should be houses.
Strong generalization, just next door to me (within the last 2 years) a young family of 2 (now 3) purchased a 4BR 2 Bath home on a qtr acre. Both parents are in late 20's. He's ex-marine now cop, she is stay at home mom. Home sold for $325k. Taxes are less than $10K. Home is in a 500+ home development with schools, shops, etc all very close & rated above average. The neighborhood is a diverse mix of young, old & everything in between. You can find similar in Hunterdon, Warren, Somerset, Sussex & Morris Counties if you look.
There was an article I read a while ago that said the biggest reason millennials have such low homeownership rates is that boomers basically aren't downsizing like previous generations did.
I just built a 5200sq ft house I plan to stay in long term, because it's close to a million for a crappy townhouse where there's a chance I hate the neighbors and the ongoing fees eat into my retirement. I built a second floor master I live in now and a first floor master ready to age into when the time comes. It doesn't make sense in most towns to downsize. It only works if you leave a very high cost area to love West or South to much cheaper areas
Supply and demand.
The condos in my area start at like 450k so I think most just rent until they put their parents in a nursing home.
Ocean County is chock-full of multi-level 3+ BR senior communities. It's absolutely insane to me
Yall are buying homes?
It's the freaking Abundance Bro movement. They are **obsessed** with abundance smdh
Get your land before poor people live next to you
Lol we bought a modest  first house in burlington after I got out of the Army. Taxes were cheap for NJ, Schools were great but we are about to be forced to sell because of the massive increase in taxes over Murphys term along with the huge increase in electricity. We replaced ever bulb and appliances with energy efficiency models and guess what? Cost kept sky rocketing.
I hate these 55+ communities, they make no sense, and it's blatant age discrimination how do they even get away with that?? It's not like it's an ""elder care facility"" with medical staff on site to care for vulnerable individuals, it's just cheaper housing privileges for being older, it takes away from so many people in the state looking to buy and for the elders that do live in these communities they make it more difficult to pass on their estate or sell it for a reasonable value.
Towns love 55+ communities, because it pretty much guarantees no school aged kids, which represent more than half of your towns budget. 

The second thing going on is that there is just no inventory due to the number of people sitting on super low notes. Toss in some stuff brought on with covid with people putting down more roots and being less tied to their commute. 

It makes more financial sense, and especially in a community that they have established themselves in, for folks who would have typically moved up in homes to just gut\rebuild their current homes. So in addition to the lack of inventory, you have a whole segment of it, small homes in nice towns, which are quickly disapearing and were a foundation of entering the housing market from the boomers through Gen X and early Millennials.

All of this means for people who would have traditionally downsized, there is no financial sense in doing so if you don't need to urgently extract value from your current home. You'll have both a hard time even finding a place, let alone not overpaying for it.

What really needs to happen is to work out a way that people who are sitting on those super low notes can move between properties without taking a hit on it. The current system only encourages them to borrow against their equity, which is where a lot of ""cash"" offers on properties come from, further screwing with constraint and home prices (and indirectly the mortgage market). 

As for luxury townhouses, that is what the market is calling for right now. You have a ton of people who are doing well, want a decent place, are willing to pay for it, but are boxed out of the home market right now. It also allows towns a way to meet their affordable housing requirements without having to sacrifice a ton of land, and to ensure that developments aren't tax negative.

And i don't think that its all a bad thing, replacing the traditional starter home with more apartment\urban style living. Its a great learning experience for people to live around diverse groups in close comfort. It fosters culture and understanding. It helps level the playing field.

Owning a home and your own little plot of land was never a guarantee or promise at any point in history, and honestly its not for everyone.
Because downsizing doesn‚Äôt make sense any more in this state unless you move 45 minutes + west or southwest or 90 minutes south. My parents have a 2000 sq ft home in a really good area. No kids in the house. My dad still works in Jersey City, so it needs to be commutable to there. Anything within a 20 minute drive from where they live hust doesn‚Äôt make sense, even if they go much smaller, they‚Äôd be going from a $1M to a $800k house in similar condition and the cost, stress and effort of moving just isn‚Äôt worth it.

There also ain‚Äôt much to downsize into, a bi level isn‚Äôt exactly huge. My mom is quite attached to the area as well, so there would need to be significant savings and a newer house that needs no work to have it make sense to them. They are against HOAs, so 55+ communities wouldn‚Äôt work either.


The issue with NJ is the land is so expensive that it doesn‚Äôt make sense to build a small house, that‚Äôs why there are no starter homes for sale. The house my parents live in is worthless, there‚Äôs a 75% chance is gets knocked down and replaced with a 5500 sq ft house if they sell. It‚Äôs the land that has value.
Palisades Park zoning allows duplexes by right. From 2000 to 2020 the city has quietly gained 40% population - their density is more than twice neighboring Leonia(who gained 6.5% in that time), and their effective property taxes are half. The people living there love it.

If you don't allow affordable homes to be built by allowing sensible zoning policies, you won't get affordability. If every city had the policy that Palisades Park has, every house would be an affordable house and you could walk to the local cafe just as they do.
All of North America is filled with Boomer empty nesters occupying 3-5 bedroom homes.

If your kids have moved out, it's time to get a 1-2 bedroom small house, so that a Millennial newlyweds can start their families in an appropriately large house.
I think a big part of it is the cost to build new housing. Once you clear all the permits and reviews and are ready to build, you‚Äôve already spent a ton of money, so it makes sense to build the most expensive thing you can sell. There‚Äôs not much incentive to build lower cost housing these days.

Also, y‚Äôknow, boomers being greedy and selfish and refusing to downsize.
Then why not build them for all ages? I mainly see 55+ going up.
Open plans started because they are actually cheaper to build.

They require some more expensive composite wood structural elements (basically engineered wood).  But you save a ton of money on reducing the number of walls, that‚Äôs a lot less wood, drywall, electrical and the time spent installing all of it.

You‚Äôve got 2-3 expensive beams supporting the structure, but you saved a lot with having half the walls.
This is the problem. I see other comments inventing these narratives, but at the end of the day, you need someplace to go if you move. I‚Äôm not ready to move yet and my house isn‚Äôt a McMansion, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind something maybe a bit smaller at some point, lower taxes, and a little less expensive. I know I could move to a less populated part of nj, but it‚Äôs just not worth the headache of selling my house, buying something else, and moving, plus giving up the proximity to the places I like for not much difference in overall cost.
This is my case. Wife & I 58. Bought house 19 years ago in Bergen County & it‚Äôs paid off. Kids graduated public school, both now on their own. Can‚Äôt afford to sell this & downsize. Crazy. We‚Äôre never leaving now.
They just put up these apartments next to the train station in my town. The rents are Manhattan level, $4,000 or more for a one bedroom
My MIL is convinced the one by her is a money laundering operation, mostly because it's supposed to be for senior citizens but the townhouses are all expensive multi-levels with stairs and it makes no sense to her. But she has been brainwashed into the ""any housing is good housing/fuck them kids"" mindset, so she did and said nothing when the town council was soliciting comments.
I had a similar experience. It was murder sorting through all of the stuff.
I threaten my father in law with a Viking funeral in his house.
The houses my parents bought after the kids moved out were MUCH bigger than our NJ house. Because 
1) the houses were cheaper because they weren‚Äôt in NJ
2) they thought we would visit and 
3) my mother wanted lots of space for her many many hobbies. Sooooooo much stuff to get rid of. At least they were specialty items and not random cheap things from Kohls and Target.
I‚Äôll tell you something that‚Äôs going to be a problem, dvds. We were trying to clean out the house the other day and realized my wife probably has a thousand dollars worth of dvds and she didn‚Äôt want to get rid of them. I‚Äôm like, we don‚Äôt have anything to play them on anymore. It got me thinking, we aren‚Äôt the only people with this issue, what the hell is everyone going to do with them?
Same with my stepdad. So much stuff!
Yep. The idea that seniors should move out of the area is bizarre. 

Outside of financial reasons, it‚Äôs bizarre to think anyone would want to move away from family/friends and the area they spent the last 60+ years building a life in
There are so many restrictions tons as to why NJ can‚Äôt build, where it can build. Lots of regulation currently.
I agree, that all makes sense, but it seemed like no one really talked about it and then during Covid suddenly everyone realized it was a major issue and prices skyrocketed at once in the span of a few years. Do you think it was people moving here from NYC + a flood of new homeowners trying to enter the market at once due to super low rates? I know I tried to be one of them but even with a 2% rate I couldn‚Äôt compete with how high over asking things were going and I‚Äôm still stuck in an apartment years later.
A lot of the problem is people don't want affordable housing, they want rock bottom prices on 3,000 sq ft sfh with a yard big enough for a pool.

They're pissed off that other people have what they want and think they got it all for a song. The grass is always greener, isn't it?

They don't want to be the ones sharing an entrance or walls with their neighbors. Instead, it's easier to whine how it's all so unfair and builders should just build them a $800,000 house and sell it for $400,000 because THEY deserve it! 

And old people ('boomers' which is apparently anyone over 45?) should sell or just give away their houses because what do they need them for anyway? The younger people that decided to have 3 kids and 2 dogs before they could even afford a townhouse just deserve it more than anyone, obviously. 

Everytime this comes, it's always build more 'housing', but housing is being built and actually available, but then it's 'No, I meant sfh. Condo style apartments aren't good enough.' 

Building more housing turns the places you want to live in into places you don't want to live in. And the reason the places you want to live in are there in the first place is because the people that initially built there either couldn't  afford to live in the place where they were or wanted to get away from the squished in sharing walls type of living in the first place. They moved out to the 'sticks' which are now those very expensive suburbs with a plethora of single family homes.
>NJ is great. Lots of people want to live here. So either we build enough housing or all these problems get worse. Pick one. 


I'd rather have expensive housing than overcrowding.
NYC/ is a blessing and curse. Our incomes and what not are higher because of people earning in NYC, but even if we have a massive expansion of housing unless NY/NYC get their shit together we're trying to compensate for the even worse failures of NYC/NY to construct housing. I've got co-workers trying to buy in the suburbs in NY and they have even less housing stock at even worse prices. We need a concerted national effort to spur construction.
My aunt upsized for less money in the midwest. She always wanted horses so she sold her house and got a big house with a pasture 15 minutes from a relatively large city.
This is a big part of my question lol
Having cleaned or helped clean out two homes, one a hoarder, the other just a pack-rat with too much space, it's so common there are even firms that will help you do it.  Yes, We-Got-Junk is your friend, but so are 50' foot dumpsters.  We went thru two on them.  And a 25' foot one too.

However I really don't see any malevolence or great planning other than a lack of public transport, regarding the people farms, aka wrinkle farms.

Land is cheaper in Ocean County, compared to the rest of the northern areas of the state anyway and people die so that's where cemeteries are too.  

People drive way beyond when they should because of desire for independence and a lack of public transport.

Regarding liquor shops, NJ has the second lowest rate rate of alcohol related deaths, with Utah leading.  (Worst is New Mexico, second worst is Alaska). 
https://drugabusestatistics.org/alcohol-abuse-statistics/#new-jersey

But alcohol use and abuse is a nationwide problem.  Why do you think they let liquor stores open during COVID as essential stores?  They couldn't have all the alcoholics detoxing at once and flooding the ERs. They were filled with COVID patients.
Will she sell a school desk? Because people are always looking for those.
Leisure Village, district. Your comments about Hooper Ave. Is so true.
There is no ‚Äúby design‚Äù. No one is pulling the strings. Thats honestly delusional thinking. 

Ocean county has lots of 55+ areas because it was historically cheaper and retirees like the idea of being near a beach. Funeral homes serve a purpose and will exist where they can make money. Same with liquor stores. There‚Äôs liquor stores literally everywhere and I doubt the proximity to a liquor store influences the frequency anyone in this state drinks alcohol.
Boomers in my family have done this, though- all the siblings bought ~1500sqft condos in the same 55+ community because they wanted to be closer together. They didn‚Äôt want to keep up with the big houses anymore- cleaning, yard, maintenance, etc, becomes too much. I was surprised when they bit the bullet but but it‚Äôs been great for them.
Im not a boomer but why would I go through the trouble of moving just to downsize and end up paying more money for a smaller place?
The idea was that as you got older you wouldn't want all the maintenance of a big house and you could take a big portion of the appreciation on the home and bank it for retirement by buying a smaller (cheaper) property. 


If you are younger you see seniors sitting in mostly empty 3 or 4 bed homes in good school districts that you can't get into because they won't move. Even if you had the money there is nothing to buy. 


Then you have the state subsidizing seniors' property taxes so they are effectively insulated from the needs of the community. Not only are they sitting on valuable school desks the state effectively shields them from any economic incentives (despite seniors sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars in home equity) to move. 


Personally I don't think you owe anyone else your home. If you want to stay in your 5 bed, go ahead. But I shouldn't be paying your property taxes just because you might be cash poor but sitting on $1m in home equity.
As a boomer (currently kind of homeless but looking/waiting) I know I hate more space than I need. I‚Äôve always lived in small apartments so the thought of cleaning & the upkeep of a big house or apartment are daunting.
Best comment in the thread. Please take my expired reddit gold
People keep blaming boomers for being greedy on this issue, but in previous generations it made sense because you could downsize, take the money and do things with it.  

It has to make financial sense for people to downsize and right now it doesnt in a lot of cases.
Previous generations also more typically lived in multigenerational homes. So, it wasn't uncommon for the parents to move in with one of their grown children or for one of the children to stay in the family home and raise their kids there.
Except previous generations downsized to moving in with their kids.

I don‚Äôt see millennials building in-law suites in their garages for their parents to move into.
I can't imagine keeping 5200sq ft clean when I'm 70.
I would rather live on a half acre without another house attached to my house.
That‚Äôs a loophole towns use to build less affordable housing. I forget the specifics but 55+ housing counts in some way towards the requirements.
Because if you build more housing for young families, you need new schools for their kids. But if you build more housing for 55+, you need more hospitals. Schools don't turn a profit, hospitals do.
Towns are more likely to approve 55+ because these communities do not add to the school population
This is a huge problem in NJ. It seems the only new housing development is for 55+ communities. The people moving into those homes aren‚Äôt selling their old houses, they are just renting them out to younger people.
It usually has to do with the school district's student capacity. There is a cap on how many can go to each school, so the zoning boards think that 55+ communities are the answer for new housing. It's also to try to keep boomers and their tax $$ here.
55+ counts in the affordable housing formula.  

So you meet that requirement without introducing all the problem and trash that always comes with free for all section 8 and affordable housing.  

Plus 55+ dont hit your school systems, which is usually the biggest issue with adding lots of new housing.  if your city started adding lots of new housing available to everyone you will have major school issues within a decade. 

all the people who constantly babble on about trains and shitty dense condos ignore that if your city does not have services and infrastructure to support that, it becomes a huge problem fast.  

Ever notice that the big cities that these goofballs all want to model after always have notoriously shit and overcrowded schools, poor city services, etc? Density causes way more problems than it fixes.
Golden handcuffs. I‚Äôve got friends and family that either bought during Covid or refinanced. They have interest rates that are 2-3% and are basically trapped. It‚Äôs a nice problem to have that a lot of us would take but if you need to downsize or move up for a growing family you can‚Äôt.
I am not allowed to mention 1-800-GOT-JUNK in front of my father or he gets very pissy.
See if you can donate them to your local library?
If you got a large collection, you probably bulk sell it online
I just threw out my 400+ CD collection when my mom.moved out of her house. Of.coirse like two weeks later I hear a report that old media like that is having a resurgance, but I dont have time to go through all of them to see whats still good and what isnt.
If you really really want to save them you can still get cd wallets for cheap and it'll at least it'll condense it to a few binder sized things.
Art project. Those things are hella reflective.
If you want to hang onto them without taking up so much space, get a few of the big binders that hold 400 discs each, file the discs, and throw the rest of the crap away. I prefer physical media, but I store everything that way now because it takes up a fraction of the space.
Not only should seniors move but they should do it even if it doesnt make financial sense simply because other people demand it because there's not enough housing?  The whole conversation surrounding it is nonsensical to me.
Yup. We need a complete revamp. It takes too long to do anything, and the rules around what can go where are extremely restrictive to the point that in many cases it amounts to a de facto ban on new housing (which is often the point).
I‚Äôm a big believer that Covid gets the blame for a lot of problems, but really I think it just stepped on the gas of what was already happening
I definitely think New Yorkers who sold their expensive apartments/brownstones and moved to NJ for more space is part of the issue, but we were looking at houses in 2019 and prices were definitely on the rise, though there weren‚Äôt as many bidding wars as you see now.¬†
Like I‚Äôve been saying, the shortage is a policy choice. Fortunately more and more people are voting for candidates that want to make NJ accessible to people who *aren‚Äôt* rich enough to win a bidding war. You obviously lean the other way. Ask me, it‚Äôs an exclusionary, basically indefensible ‚ÄúI got mine‚Äù position, but you do you.
> We need a concerted national effort to spur construction.

Absolutely.
But I don't think it's because they can finally afford a house. Boomers and Gen X were able to afford a home in their younger years. Boomers were able to do it on one salary. Moving into a bigger home in retirement is nuts. It's a bit of a flex.
Nope she wants to hoard and die with all the crap she's accumulated. She has endless cooking supplies and cookware from Williams Sonoma she's accumulated. She could help at least 20 families start put with kitchen supplies. She refuses to share or sell or part with any of it. 

She's like a Pharoah and needs to die with her treasures
I don't like to use the term boomers, because I also know many who completely buck that term.  But they normies üòé

I'm actually working on a 55+ community now. They look like townhomes from outside, but are single floor units, flats. 2bed, 2bath, good size living, dining, kitchen area. They are probably just over 1500sgft.
When I first started the job, I thought the units were so tiny, I've been conditioned to assume bigger is better. I now see them as the perfect size for a retired couple.
Totally understand the idea behind it. I also understand the point of subsidizing their property taxes - if they didn‚Äôt there wouldn‚Äôt be a single retiree in NJ and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to collect those nice capital gains taxes. 

As a parent, the only thing I see other parents complain about more than lack of available housing is that grandparents aren‚Äôt around to help. That second one gets way worse if those tax subsidies go away.
Stay in nj shifts the burden to younger people for sure. Absolute shit policy, pay your fair share or downsize if you can‚Äôt 100%
Youre not ""paying their property tax"" any more than they are ""paying for your kids"" between child tax credits and schools.
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm the same way as you - a small space person (albeit a millennial). I‚Äôm just saying people are seemingly resentful that boomers aren‚Äôt automatically selling their homes that they lived in the majority of their lives because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs always been done.
Yeah I hear ya. I'm a pretty neat and clean person, so I don't mind doing an hour or so a day, plus I have a service a couple times a month
Come to Sussex County.
Affordable housing could be a good start but what about the people stuck in the middle who make more than the cap for affordable housing but who can‚Äôt afford 1 million+ for a home‚Ä¶ I would love someone, anyone, to just build a regular neighborhood.
Mt Laurel housing, named after a Supreme Court case holding that every town in NJ has to build affordable housing. However, housing for seniors and disabled people counts.
Yes, this is accurate. Every township needs to meet an affordable housing threshold, and 55+ qualifies, which is why you see so much 55+ being built. I know a lot of townships are notorious for not having met their quota‚Äî Wall Township comes to mind.
If it's like special needs housing, each unit built counts double.
I believe senior housing is double credit towards affordable housing. Same with disabled and veteran. So if the town has to build 20 affordable units, if they designate them senior, veteran, or disabled then they only have to put 10 in to meet the requirement.
All towns in NJ must make ""affordable housing"" a percentage of all new residential builds (I think it's 15%). Towns don't want poors coming in with their poor people problems, so they make boomer housing since boomers are usually on guarenteed fixed incomes but don't commit crime.
as long as it meets affordability rules i think it can count towards their requirements. towns want this because 55+ people means no more kids in the school system.
Yup, every time affordable housing is proposed town residents complain about overcrowding in schools, so 55+ becomes the solution
Because they can make affordable housing that's age restricted, it avoids adding kids to the schools. 

It's perverting the intention of those affordable housing requirements while allowing towns to check a box and not actually do anything for working class families.
It‚Äôs not a loop hole..  we have an aging population and need more housing for the elderly because we have more due to less babies‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not rocket science it‚Äôs facts.   Not all boomers are wealthy most are pretty fucking terrible at finances
Yes, municipalities love 55+... Dense population increases the tax base, an HOA means they have very little to maintain, little to no ""impact"" on schools or crime rate, and credit towards affordable housing.
Former Realtor here. This, mostly, with the additional double-standard of social perception.

Build subsidized housing for 55+, and the neighbors will call it ‚Äúsenior living‚Äù. 
Dedicate the same space and subsidies to young families with kids, and suddenly you have ‚Äútenements‚Äù.
The baby boomer population is also very large. That played a lot into the development of the past 10 years
The irony is the schools that were built in the 1950s & 60s to educate the boomers are now being closed because there aren‚Äôt enough working class families to support them.

It is uncommon to rent out their old houses, at least in Northern NJ.  Most people sell their old houses and use it to pay for the condo or just have the savings.

NJ is an expensive place to retire, and  people moving to cheaper, warmer states, use the proceedsnof a home sale to finance the move.
Lol that‚Äôs not true AT ALL. Services get cheaper with density. Fewer meters of wire, pipes, fewer miles of sidewalk and road per capita. Denser buildings are easier to heat and cool bc of the surface area to volume ratio. Etc. In general, cities are safer than rural areas. Density is a huge net positive and it‚Äôs *easier* for taxes to support basic services with higher density.

It‚Äôs also inherently more affordable beyond the housing itself, because at higher densities a car isn‚Äôt a necessity. You aren‚Äôt maintaining extra space you don‚Äôt use. 

Also: way lower carbon emissions per capita.

Embrace density, y‚Äôall.
That 1980s poster and Beanie Babies will never appreciate in value üò´
I mean yeah, but just in general, what are we going to do with it all? What is going to happen to all our useless garbage?
Meanwhile the state will cut their property taxes significantly with stay in nj,¬†which fucks the younger people even more.
It's not indefensible. I simply making a quality over quantity argument. Which I think a ton of NJ would agree with. 

It's already crowded. If you can't afford to live here there are 49 other states.
good thing there are 49 other states where you can go find what you want since you clearly cant afford here

bye bye
i mean, you're a dead ringer for whiney gen z'er so who cares?
>if they didn‚Äôt there wouldn‚Äôt be a single retiree in NJ and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to collect those nice capital gains taxes. 


If they have so much capital gains they can use them to pay the property taxes. They don't need a subsidy. 


>That second one gets way worse if those tax subsidies go away.

I also have no interest in subsidizing your childcare via senior property tax reductions. If you want Grandma around then you can pay for it.
Show proof of this. One that accounts or how much seniors without kids pay into schools and that families get child tax credits seniors don't. 

I'm not a senior and I don't have kids but it's so tiring that people attack senior citizens when 60% of my taxes go to schools.
I pay state income tax which the state then uses to pay seniors property taxes. 


I'm absolutely paying their property taxes. 


And I don't have kids, so I'm also paying for the kids school. 


Really I'm paying my portion and the seniors portion through the NJ stay program.
I get that too. People tell me to move to another state where it‚Äôs cheaper and I‚Äôm like away from the only place I ever lived, my family, my friends, and my doctors! It‚Äôs their home and if they‚Äôre okay with taking care of it, who cares?!
So you're alone in 5200sq ft!!
One of my pipe dreams is to build affordable housing, in the sense that it is affordable for everyone, not limited to income or age. I suspect there are only two ways to make it feasible here - either build no frills apartments, or small barebones single family homes, like the bones should be solid, but everything else would meet bare minimum requirements. The idea would be it's up to the homeowner to upgrade anything inside, if they want. I am from Texas and they do this there, the houses are ugly as sin, like [here](https://www.har.com/homedetail/11958-greensbrook-forest-dr-houston-tx-77044/3434027) is an example, check out the neighborhood view, but at least you get a roof over your head for an affordable price.
Address the shortage and it‚Äôll get built. The shortage messes up the market - people will pay a lot to live here, and until that demand is addressed, the stuff that gets built will be whatever can make the most money. The shortage is everything here.
The competition is so tight due to inventory, particularly ‚Äúregular‚Äù single family homes, that those houses are pushing $1mil. 1500 sq is around 60ok+ 2k sq feet is like 800k+. The neighborhood I live in was a regular middle class neighborhood, now it‚Äôs upper middle to upper.¬†
I see many towns putting up more housing yo meet the requirements, but it's all condos. Huge 3-4 story block long condos in the 'affordable' range.

You wanted more housing?  You got it. Ugly brick one step up from tenement housing. Yay.

Building houses? Well, most desirable towns are 'built out'. It costs almost 300 to take down an old house and another 400-500 (for 1,500 sq ft one level) to rebuild new, us the price to acquire the old house which could be  400-500. So, a 'regular' house on the low end ends up costing the builder an easy 1.2 million. 

Let's say they can scale that number down a bit with deals, economies of scale, etc. You're still looking at sales prices close to a million because they need to get some sort of profit out of the deal.

THAT is why you don't see them building 'regular' neighborhoods at 1960 prices. You can even acquire the building materials and permits for what you're thinking of at those prices, let alone paying the installers/contractors.

The money for 'affordable' housing only makes sense from a building standpoint of stacked condos.
A lot of affordable housing IS for people in the middle. You can qualify with six figure incomes depending on the household size.
Very few have met them, but thats partially the fault of the coalirion that devides the numbers bot meeting their own deadlines. They seem to honestly believe towns are just going to build while waiting for the number.
Wouldn‚Äôt be unaffordable if we just built enough housing!

Others here have articulated why people (I think correctly) call it a loophole.

End of the day all this stuff is just bandaids bc we have a housing shortage.
Bingo. Also the race angle. Don‚Äôt forget that.
And the states response was stay nj program which will cut more school funding
OMG, the Beanie Babies! I found so, so many and I couldn‚Äôt even donate to anyplace but Goodwill!
If only that was it.  My nephew, now 21, started riding a bicycle on the bicycle his father used and still now sits in the three car garage where you can barely park one car.  It‚Äôs not hoarding but he‚Äôs a pack rat.
I do suggest maybe having a back up DVD player around and keep a few though! Our cable box (used strictly for wifi, no cable in the house anymore) got destroyed during a 3 day huge rainstorm and Verizon couldn't get out for 4 days because so many people had issues after the storm and having some DVDs for kids and adults came in clutch.
What about child tax credits seniors don't get?  What about schools they don't have children to use? 

Why do families deserve help but senior citizens don't?  As long as these programs have sensible income limits, you should support helping others. If you're lucky you'll be old one day too.
Lol it‚Äôs not overcrowded at all. We‚Äôve just made the policy decision to underfund transit in favor of making people own and use cars. That‚Äôs also a policy choice! More density around transit and necessities like supermarkets and pharmacies would make the state feel less crowded because it would take cars off roads.
Hey asshole, I already own a house. Unlike *some* people, I‚Äôm not trying to close the door behind me.
I know you are, but what am I? ü§¶
Like I said, since they have to pay their state capital gains taxes, it‚Äôs an incentive to keep them here (which the state wants).

And there‚Äôs plenty I don‚Äôt want my taxes going to - I‚Äôm sure most would agree with that. That‚Äôs just largely out of our control.
If that's the attitude then I don't want to pay for other people's kids to use schools. Or roads I don't use. I've never called the police or fire in my town so why pay for those either. 

Very libertarian of you.
So then you're also paying families portions for child tax credits and schools. Do you get mad you pay taxes for roads you don't drive on and other services you don't use?  Or just selectively applying your outrage?
The problem is they get their taxes frozen and then the town complains there‚Äôs not enough tax revenue to keep schools open. Look at Middletown they are closing 4 schools. What‚Äôs the solution, raise the tax on the younger folk already paying out the ass for ¬†housing in this state? Lots of people care‚Ä¶¬†
Even stuff like that would get bid up out of range for many people here.
Rowhomes.
Land is the constraint. You price a good amount of ppl out of the development before you start building anything because the land is expensive.
It would make total sense for a group of investors to create a neighborhood with these types of houses.  After a few years the homeowners can easily upgrade the kitchen and baths, if the bones are built to last.
We need Levitt houses again
Kruschevkas?
Do you have a source on that 300k to demolish a house in NJ? It seems exceptionally high from what i have seen
Yeah but if you‚Äôre a married couple each making a little over 100k you don‚Äôt qualify but still don‚Äôt make enough to buy a 1 million dollar home with a 7% interest rate
Is there enough room to hang it from the ceiling to save space? My father would do this with my bicycles as a child to save space and then put the riding lawnmower underneath.
Walking around my town I disagree. You could take all the cars off the roads I want fewer ppl on my sidewalks and in my grocery line and on my commuter train.
>Like I said, since they have to pay their state capital gains taxes, it‚Äôs an incentive to keep them here (which the state wants).


That's such a dumb argument. If they have so many cap gains for the state to reap in taxes then a few k on property taxes is not material. Nobody is going to pay 20k in cap gains to save 5k on property taxes that wasn't already going to stay. 



>And there‚Äôs plenty I don‚Äôt want my taxes going to - I‚Äôm sure most would agree with that. That‚Äôs just largely out of our control.


No it's not. NJ is old and its young are transient so seniors largely get their way. You get what you vote for.
If you own a property that has a property tax, you should pay said tax or sell the property. 


Its really not relevant what the tax funds. You owe your share so pay up. 


But I'd agree to allow you to opt out of school taxes. Would save me 10k/yr to do so myself.
I would rather not pay those either, but at least good schools support my property values. I am getting something there. 


What is bullshit about NJ stay is that seniors are sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars in home equity but we subsidize them monopolizing the housing supply because they might be too cash poor to pay the property taxes. 


If you can't pay the property taxes you can take you 500k in home equity and leave.
You‚Äôre saying retired people in homes over 30 years caused 4 schools to close in one town???
Not even full-on row homes, just homes that aren't 30' from the street and each other.
Density and LVT! These are all solvable problems! Expensive housing is not a law of physics or something.
it doesnt when you could put nice homes on the lots and make a lot more while having a much nicer community

that is why no business is targeting this market.
Yes, I have a personal set of sources which I'm unwilling to share, but I googled it for you, I was actually a little low because of my personal sources:

""Demolishing and hauling away a 1,500 square foot house in New Jersey typically costs between $6,000 and $25,000, with factors like location and debris disposal affecting the final price. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Average Cost Range:
Expect to pay anywhere from $6,000 to $25,000 for a typical 1,500 square foot house demolition. 
Factors Affecting Cost:
Location: Demolition in a city or densely populated area will likely be more expensive than in a rural area due to access and cleanup challenges. 
Debris Disposal: The cost of hauling away the debris can vary depending on the volume and type of materials. 
Site Preparation: Preparing the site for demolition, such as clearing vegetation or removing utilities, can add to the cost. 
Special Materials: If the house contains asbestos, lead, or other hazardous materials, their removal and disposal will increase the overall cost. 
Permits and Inspections: You'll need to obtain the necessary permits and inspections, which can add to the cost. 
Cost per Square Foot:
Demolition costs can range from $4 to $10 per square foot, with deconstruction (a more cautious method of disassembling a structure) costing between $8 and $16 per square foot. 
Partial Demolition:
If you only need to demolish a portion of the house (e.g., a deck, chimney, or pool), the cost will be lower, potentially ranging from $5,000 to $15,000. 
Deconstruction:
Deconstruction, which involves carefully disassembling a structure to salvage reusable materials, can be more expensive than traditional demolition, costing between $15,000 to $40,000.""
Okay well it sounds like you belong in like north Dakota or Wyoming. Odd to live in the densest state while seeming to hate being around people.

I mean seriously, ‚Äúmy‚Äù sidewalk? Who the fuck are you? What a shitty attitude.

You‚Äôre exactly what I said earlier: ‚ÄúI got mine and  nobody else can have it.‚Äù The fucking balls that takes.
To your first point - no but it makes it more enticing. And to your second point, all political parties spend my taxes on things I don‚Äôt like.
Idk. I have seen this in tx with the garage facing front and it's terrible. I mean most NJ trolley car suburbs have this density and it's meh.
Lvt can lower the purchase price but it doesn't lower the cost because all the land price discount you get goes to paying the taxes. 

Density can scale down costs, but then it's just expensive to build new buildings so it would be hard to build anything other than sros that would be universally affordable
Yeah..your Google quote supports my opinion that $300k was way too high. Please point out where that cost is.  Additionally, i have been partially involved a few demos and never seen costs above $120k
>Okay well it sounds like you belong in like north Dakota or Wyoming. Odd to live in the densest state while seeming to hate being around people.


I work in financial services so NYC is where the jobs and the money is. I live in NJ because New York is worse. 


I don't hate ppl, I just don't want to be bumping into them constantly every time I open my door or have to wait 30 minutes to checkout the grocery or be packed into a train like some canned fish. 


Jack up the prices and thin it out a little. Just a little is fine. 


>You‚Äôre exactly what I said earlier: ‚ÄúI got mine and  nobody else can have it.‚Äù The fucking balls that takes.


Anybody who can afford it can have it. Quality isn't free. And the entitlement to think *you* are owed a spot in *my* state. The fucking balls on you.
SROs are fine. So are studios, 1brs, etc. build it all. There‚Äôs demand.
Ouch! Wait! I mistyped, $30,000.    

$30,000!

My calcs look off because of it, but the end result is not.
I already own a fucking house, asshole. Unlike your selfish ass, I'm working to make that opportunity available to people aren't finance bro pricks.
New studios by me cost 3k/month plus another $500 per parking spot.
Ah! That makes more sense lol. Yes, 30k is more in the right ballpark, though i agree pretty conservative for NJ. Usually costs arent too bad to do a full teardown and only get crazy when dealing with historical buildings oe something like demoing a middle row house.
Assumes you want parking, and it wouldn‚Äôt be that much if supply met the demand.
Thanks for catching that!
300k seemed very high.

But I‚Äôve seen 60k for SFH jobs where the government was responsible to implement the demo, and they had to bid out the A&E design work and the physical teardown work separately, and they could award the bids to only vendors authorized to enter government contracts‚Ä¶
You don't need to buy a spot, but you are still out 3k/month to live in an exurb. 


But high prices are ultimately good. Keeps it from getting overcrowded and keeps the rif raff out.
Always about keeping the, uh, ""rif raff"" out at the end of the day...
No crime in my little town. High prices have a lot to do with that."
American Dream Mall,"I've read and been told many different things.

My ASD 5yr olds birthday is in May and I would love to take her to Dream Works and do a little shopping as well. However, I was told I'd have to pay for parking, as well as park tickets of course. Then spend more at the stores and on food. I mean, I don't mind doing so if it's worth it. 

Have you been there? How was it? Are the prices within reason? ",0.68,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jhwzh2/american_dream_mall/,29,1jhwzh2,2025-03-23 11:16,"Parking is $5. There‚Äôs a lot to do for a 5 year old there. You can get combo tickets for the Legoland Discovery Zone and Aquarium. There is the Nickolodeon theme park, and seperately the Dreamworks indoor waterpark. Both pretty expensive but fun. I‚Äôd recommend getting tickets for those during a holidays sale or going during the cheaper off hours if you can. There‚Äôs also ceramic painting, mini golf, small interactive museums, an arcade, indoor skiing and tubing. Ice skating. And of course shops and restaurants. I‚Äôd plan on doing one or two things because it‚Äôs huge.
Parking is around $5. I don‚Äôt find the food or stores more or less expensive than anywhere else. Weekends it‚Äôs insanely crowded so get there early if you can. Have fun.
 The food is overpriced by 30% compared to other malls. But you should at least visit once. We have been there 20 times. Most during winter when there's nothing to do
Definitely don‚Äôt go today. They‚Äôre doing a whole concert/convention right now & I heard the garages were closed off. Otherwise I do think it‚Äôs worth going at least once, but if you hate crowds, it‚Äôs better to go on weekdays.
There's tons to do there for kids but yeah everything is pricey. We took my five year old to the mini golf, Lego place, the wheel, aquarium, and just walk around. I like it there, I think it's pretty fun, but weekends keep me away. We went during the week and it was nice.

The wheel kind of sucks, you get better views of Manhattan driving on the turnpike.
I have a nephew (level 2 ASD), and both my kids are (level 1ASD).

Depending on the day you go, the mall itself is generally not that overstimulating. Weekends and school closures may become noisy, especially by the waterpark. 

Personally, there are much better waterpark options than at this mall; including indoor ones. There's one in Central jersey and one in Long Island. 

I don't like the one at this mall cause it seems overpriced for such a small area.

There is an ice rink and a snow slope, but they are also expensive for the amount of time offered.

I hope this helps. Good luck.
While I haven‚Äôt been to this mall yet, I have been to a number of theme parks with my child on the spectrum when they were little. I‚Äôd suggest to call the locations you have in mind to visit in advance and see if they have any sort of offerings to be more accessible for kids on the spectrum. Some other a lot more than you‚Äôd expect. I agree with sticking to visiting on weekdays. I‚Äôd suggest to go as early in the day as possible though I‚Äôd ask about what the most quiet times are when you call to ask about accommodations overall. Have fun!
I love going during May-July
Parking is actually a little more than $5 now, it's like $5.33 or something obnoxious. There are so many things to do for a 5 year old. I personally think it's worth it, but my wallet says ow! There are way to get good deals, sign up for the American Dream mailing lists, you can usually get good sales, which make the activities very much worth it.
It's in North Jersey of course the prices aren't going to be reasonable
Skip it and save yourself a trouble
THANKS FOR THE INFO!

I didn't know about the combo option. I'm definitely going to look into that.
DISCOVERY ZONE?! LIKE THE ONE WE HAD BACK IN THE 90s?!
Rather than making another post, just gonna ask this here.

What‚Äôs a reasonable expectation for a day trip? Going with a 2 year old soon, trying to figure out if planning on the amusement park, aquarium, meal and some shopping is reasonable or if I need to temper expectations.
Oh, I bet. I didn't even consider that. Ill likely do a Thursday instead then.
Korean corn dogs are worth it
Yes, there‚Äôs a Jonas Brothers event there today, March 23rd
Yet Dreamworks is the largest indoor waterpark in America. Otherwise, I do agree that Hurricane Harbor and Splish Splash offer better prices.
Omg tysm for this!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I know right lol
I'm expecting it to be like most other places that have activities but being that there's so much to do, I don't want to go bankrupt either. I've never been so Im also hoping it's as nice as most of the reviews
Toys ‚ÄúR‚Äù Us Flagship store is there as well.¬†
My last memory of Discovery Zone is me throwing up all over myself on the way there. Ate too many pretzels and was carsick üòÇ  

Fuzzy‚Äôs Family Fun Factory? Some kid took a shit on those rolling pins that inclined and you scooted up, smeared in between all the pins. That‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt forget
The aquarium is pretty small and less than an hour to walk through. For Nickelodeon the height requirement is 36‚Äù for rides, so take that into consideration for your two year old. I‚Äôd personally wait until 3-4 years old for that. But it might be worth it for the paw patrol area. They opened a Sesame Streer learn and play center that might be better but I‚Äôve never checked it out, it wasn‚Äôt open when my son was that age.

But anyway, I think you have a lot on your schedule for what i would be up for, it get crowded, it‚Äôs loud and a lot going on. I‚Äôd probably skip the shopping since the stores aren‚Äôt necessarily exclusive just to AD but that‚Äôs always something you can decide once you‚Äôre there.
So thats whats going on‚Ä¶
If you ask nicely at the customer service desk they will validate your parking. The amount of fun things to do for the kiddies is amazing. Wear comfy shoes and bring snacks.
Right I love living in New Jersey but it has gotten pricey
They have one?!?! I think I'd be more excited than her! LOL She'd have thr audacity not to understand how epic that moment is and I'd have to disown her for a little while lol
It really has, sadly. I'm from Jersey City and the rents alone have become so high, it's ridiculous. Honestly makes no sense. An apartment I had in 2011, I rented for 1000. A super small 1 and a half bedroom. That same apartment with not many upgrades done to it and all is currently renting for $2250. How and why????
2011 the economy was bad, inflation, still not building enough housing for all the newcomers¬†"
"Yesterday in Monmouth County, stay classy Jersey","Not seen at the end- the drink the two kids threw at our car. For the record, all I did was beep at them for not yielding.

Theres an exit after that yield sign, thats why incoming drivers have to yield because theres not enough space to merge back.

Sorry you‚Äôre getting shit OP. Their behavior was ridiculous.
An asshole in a pickup truck. What are the chances? /s
Oof, I know exactly where that is. Every now and then I use 138 to get on the Parkway south. Sorry that happened to you... those are some shitty kids.
Both of the kids couldn‚Äôt be older than 18 or 19 and I doubt it was their truck. So, if your kids were out driving your truck yesterday, might wanna check it out üôÑ

Edit: only in jersey am I getting shit for driving like a normal adult instead of the focus being on these two idiots
Why am I not surprised it‚Äôs a pickup truck driver.
I got into an accident a few years ago because a car wouldn‚Äôt yield and I veered off the road right there to avoid rear ending the guy he saw the accident and drove off after stopping
i‚Äôm convinced people don‚Äôt know what yield means. on 35 in keyport area coming off the parkway there‚Äôs a yield sign i can‚Äôt even count how many times i have almost been hit because people decide their yield sign means so as fast as possible
You encountered one of these inbred, low IQ youth of our state ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they are embarrassing.
Take this to the police.
I swear that no one knows what ‚Äúyield‚Äù means anymore. I see people speeding off ramps with zero regard for other drivers, every single day. Same thing happens at stop signs!
Sorry that happened to you. Yeah, it‚Äôs ridiculous and speaks to people being unable to follow basic traffic rules. And if they threw their drink at you afterward that‚Äôs just ridiculous‚Äînot to mention straight up dangerous
Monmouth is full of entitled dipshits like this
School bus with kids did the same to me few days back.¬†
That's spot on rt 34 sucks. It's a terrible merge. Either way, they had the yield..
Hate when people don‚Äôt use turn signals, hate when people don‚Äôt zipper merge, but unfortunately I also hate when people move over at the last second instead of slowing down because they usually don‚Äôt use a turn signal and you don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, whether they‚Äôre letting you go or not. This is a different situation because you mentioned there was nobody behind you, so they obviously should‚Äôve just merged behind you.
MAGA doesn‚Äôt understand what Yield means. They likely barely can read.
This is Wall, and I work one minute from that spot. The truck driver is one of the smarter Wall residents unfortunately.
Monmouth county ""I'm country"" dudes want to act like rednecks so bad but would absolutely hang themselves if they had to live in ocean county
Not that unusual these days
A week ago in Monmouth County, I was behind a very slow car. I tried not to be up their butt, but I didn‚Äôt want to hold the person behind me back either by being as super slow. I drove as normal as I could. Anyway, as I turned right at the light, this guy suddenly speeds off forward and flips me off???? WHAT. 

Another time, a guy in this county cut in front of me, so I simply went in the next lane to avoid him. He gave me the iffy feeling. I just want to be safe. Anyway, he followed me to a light and came up next to my car. I could see him out of the corner of my eye (I didn‚Äôt want to give him attention) and he was shouting and waving his arms to try to get me to pull over. No dude. I luckily lost him.
I road my 10-speed from Trenton to Seaside and around New Egypt Racetrack someone threw a beer bottle and just missed my headüò°
Some kids threw a bottle of alcohol out of their window at my car one night then a few months later a cop yelled at me
For throwing a piece of lint out of my car.
I am sure the Wall Police or NJ State Troopers would love a copy of their license plate.
I HATE that spot. It feels like people either slam their breaks and never even attempt to merge or just cut everyone off and almost cause accidents. Used to do that drive every day when I worked in Wall.
You should have #77‚Äô them
This is why I avoid the far right lane. OP is totally on the right but avoid the merge to avoid the bullshit.
Pickup truck = automatic MAGA idiots
Basically every day in Jersey. But yea total bad move by the pickup.
I agree that the truck was completely in the wrong, however, when you take a Defensive Drivers course you think differently about approaching situations like this. I for example in this situation would've moved over to the left if I could have to be extra cautious and ""defensive"".
Listen, I get it, you are totally right, but why didn‚Äôt you just move over to the left? Did you have to, no, but you absolutely could‚Äôve. You would‚Äôve made it easier for the people getting on and you would‚Äôve avoided the situation. Next time when you see a bunch of people merging onto the highway, and you are clear to the left, just move over
I tend to move into the left lane when I see entrances up ahead to avoid being sideswiped by some oblivious jackass not paying attention to the road or heeding the rules of the road.
[deleted]
Honestly, the first thing I noticed was *you* not moving over to the left lane to make space for merging cars. Obviously their behaviour was nothing less than aggressive and even childish at that, but one thing I've noticed in NJ drivers is that no one anticipates for merging cars in acceleration lanes. 

I come from a European country where everyone is generally very respectful of their fellow road users, and the extremely short acceleration lanes and lack of anticipation for other road users baffle me every single time.
I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre right, but also maybe move the fuck over and let them get onto the road?  I‚Äôm as much of a ‚Äúkeep right except to pass‚Äù guy as anyone, but that‚Äôs not why this road has two lanes‚Ä¶
Eye roll
Just move over to the empty lane.
Seed King?
Thank you! I feel like I‚Äôm crazy‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt we be focusing on the truck driving out of control?
Like seriously, am I in the twilight zone?
It‚Äôs a terrible interchange.
I‚Äôve been taking it for years myself and have waited yielded there in that exact spot many times. Dumb kids
Oh, why am I NOT surprised at all it was teen drivers? I‚Äôve had two accidents involving teens in the last year - one of which totaled my car. (Fortunately, nobody was hurt).
Teens reacting poorly to people acknowledging their poor parenting? Say it ain‚Äôt so.
Or that U-Turn on 35 in Keyport, where people just come out of the U without yielding. Had it happen today, kid in a BMW, then proceeds at about 25mph. Flipped. me off when I honked like ""Yo, speed the fuck up I'm about to hit you cuz I have no choice.""

It seems Yield is the most confusing damned sign out there for some reason.
Unfortunately its becoming all too common.
100% report them. Especially if you have them throwing shit at you on video.
Unfortunately it cut into the second clip of the incident but yeah, I didn‚Äôt even notice it in the moment I was focusing on getting away from them.
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs mostly populated by entitled dipshits that moved there from Staten Island, a trash island with trash people. SI doesn‚Äôt exactly create the best or smartest kind of people. 

Ask me how I know.
Can‚Äôt spell yield without D-E-I
üòÇüòÇ
I should have. But they then cut behind me and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable using my phone with knowing how unpredictable they were being.
I would have if I wasn‚Äôt getting off to the right ü§∑
not if you're getting off at either of the exits right after this yield
For the millionth time I was going to be getting off to the right within a quarter mile. I let the white car merge, the truck then sped up and cut me off the merge ahead of me. Why would I get over to the left lane, to have to immediately get back over to the right? I wouldn‚Äôt have to. Because I had the right away.
And, there was NO ONE behind me so the truck if they waited for half a second at the yield they would have been able to just go behind me. Like how a true zipper merge is supposed to function.
Don't bother. I said the same and got 26 downvotes (and counting) ü§£
That‚Äôs what I do; move over if I can, or if slowing down by 5mph would give them enough clearance to merge then I do that instead. No, I don‚Äôt have to. But I feel like it just makes things easier for everyone especially if that person trying to merge is a nervous driver (this truck clearly was not, though).  These exits/entrances in NJ suck in general. If I‚Äôm about to exit as was depicted in OP‚Äôs video then I‚Äôd get behind the truck.

Oh, and I voted for Trump.
Because the GSP South entrance I was taking was immediately after and from that lane?
Once again, I was about to get off on the right! Why would I move to the left when I‚Äôd miss my turn by doing that? I totally get what you‚Äôre saying but it‚Äôs extremely frustrating knowing that I was completely in the correct lane in this situation. They had to yield.
It‚Äôs not a merge. The truck had a yield sign. And if you move over you risk missing your exit a 1/4 mile down the road.
They still have yield signs in Europe, so you should have known that the truck was supposed to stop upon seeing oncoming traffic in the approaching lane. That's what yield means. Obeying the signage and right-of-way rules on the road is more important than being polite.
Please stop driving until you learn what a yield sign means.
Yeah, technically the truck has to yield but not every merge will be perfect. You can see the truck already there, why push your car against it? Let it merge. 

Throwing trash at other car is not good though.
Yes unless they were about to get off - which OP says they were
If I have to answer this comment one more fucking time. I was getting off to the right immediately.
or just yield at YOUR yield sign
People in this state suck. Even if they‚Äôre not the ones behaving badly themselves, they‚Äôre at least excusing bad behavior. I‚Äôve seen it over and over again. Sorry this happened to you.
In all fairness, you had a wide open lane to the left. Cars going that fast at that dangerous ramp, it‚Äôs good defensive driving on your part to put as much distance between your vehicle (and occupants) and someone who hasn‚Äôt even slowed as you approached. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre at fault, but after driving in this state for 30+ years, i can honestly say that i truly believe everyone is driving distracted, or could give two s***s about anyone but themselves
That‚Äôs definitely the focus, and not to undermine that, but you could have been proactive and moved over to the left lane to allow space for everyone to safely merge in. (Unless there was a car on your left, but since you swerved over, I don‚Äôt think anyone was there)

They‚Äôre in the wrong here, but protect yourself by moving over and this won‚Äôt happen to you
Welcome to r/newjersey
It is a freaking nightmare. I have to take that turnoff to bring my mother to a doctor in the Brick/Lakewood area, and it is always filled with people randomly hopping on and off and not giving other drivers enough room.
Yeah on these 138/rt34/parkway merges I always jump into the left lane immediately, after almost being merged into or cut off one too many times.¬†
pretty sure to buy a BMW you have to be a complete asshat anyway. idk how keyport managed to have 2 horrible spots so close to each other
100 IQ comment
Okay, but 1. OP wasn't getting off at that next exit, and 2. as a defensive driver who needed to get off at the next turn I would've just slowed down. Notice how the black truck didn't even break, like I said, he was in the wrong, but it was a sign that he wasn't letting OP go. If you want to save yourself and your property just being right isn't good enough.

I know, I got it, that is a terrible design for the roadway right there, it‚Äôs always tricky. OK so you let the white car merge, just let the pick up merge then. I know it sucks, I know they don‚Äôt deserve it, I know they‚Äôre jerk offs. It sounds like you‚Äôre familiar with that particular piece of roadway, I‚Äôm just saying a little bit of anticipation on your part would‚Äôve avoided all this. But once again you‚Äôre right and they are very wrong
I don‚Äôt think anybody is saying that the pick up truck was in the right, in fact I would like to state unequivocally that the bloke in the pick up truck is quite the asshole

But, he did telegraph his move, you knew exactly what was going to happen. I guess next time tap the brakes and just let him merge, it‚Äôs way less aggravation for you
You got downvoted because what you‚Äôre explaining is wrong. The rules of the road indicate that you have to yield to traffic with the right of way. They also say stay to the right except to pass. What you are explaining is not how you are supposed to operate while driving. Yes, if I was able to move over to let them in I would. But I couldn‚Äôt, because my turn was right there.
I‚Äôm at 27, most people are pretty stupid and have a lot of trouble with reading comprehension
Fuck that. They want to play chicken? My SUV is 25 years old. Bring it. (/j‚Ä¶mostly)
That's not immediately after. You could have moved. But yeah, they also should have yielded. Either way, if this mild shit got you both so rattled, never venture north of Monmouth.
Yeah, the parkway ramp.is just past that merge. It's a poor design to begin with. I've had a few close calls there over the years.
I hate to disappoint you but my country has proper infrastructure and our highway engineers all know that designing highways with short acceleration lanes and yield signs are ridiculous üòÖ You're supposed to drive fast enough to match the speed of the cars *already* going at the required speed. Good luck if you drive a manual car.
It's not immediate.
Yeah I get it, but just move over. It's like an unwritten rule, just common courtesy really.
Thank you. I was in a hit and run about a year ago as well so I‚Äôve lost faith in NJ drivers. I drive defensively and safely and I know I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong in this situation. I see stupid shit like this daily, but no wonder considering so many people see nothing wrong with it, and instead consider me to be wrong.
ü§´
they said they were getting off... so no they couldn't move over
 - There‚Äôs a sub for New Jersey?
 - Welcome to Thunderdome.
""I've got an idea! Instead of having a proper ramp to 35N, let's just put a U-turn right after the exit to the southbound roadway, like, immediately after the exit.""
105. That comment require a certain degree of literacy, but not an inordinate amount. Above average, let's say, but only just.
I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs extremely frustrating having to defend myself when I did nothing wrong and the focus should be on the reckless and dangerous driving culture that has been allowed to grow in NJ.
It doesn't seem like you know the rules of the road and who has the right of way. 

Cars on the highway have the right of way and the vehicle merging onto the highway is obligated to speed up or slow down to yield to oncoming traffic.

Most people would anticipate the merging vehicle to slow down because that's what they are supposed to do.

Sure. I think it‚Äôs really easy to watch a video and see all the things you‚Äôd do differently. That wasn‚Äôt the point of me sharing this video. Edit: also, I don‚Äôt think I was exactly expecting him to cut me off. He sped up from way behind the white car pretty quickly
‚ÄúMild shit‚Äù included them throwing a drink at my car, so fuck off.
What do you mean? I have been driving this road my entire adult life. The entrance is literally immediately after that yield. Why would I enter the road, go to the left lane to let people into my lane, then potentially have to cut people off to get back over to the right to take my exit? Makes zero sense.
Sounds like you‚Äôre the type to swerve all over the road cutting people off to get to your exit. If you can make dumbass aggressive assumptions about OP then so can I. How about you shut the fuck up and learn to drive yeah?
Well obviously the majority agree with me not you, so bye
I was getting off to the right. If I moved over, I would have missed my exit. Should I just keep driving around in circles being courteous to people who don‚Äôt know how to yield to traffic with the right of way?
Thank the third of NYC that has moved here since 2020, they had to drive 8 blocks every other week and since they moved they actually get their cars/trucks/vans going more than God's/Hochul's intended speed limit of 25mph.
not to mention you have to come right off the parkway and almost immediately get over otherwise you will literally miss the u turn, i‚Äôm not sure who designed that but they clearly weren‚Äôt thinking.
I‚Äôve said multiple times that the OP is right in this situation
Well then either most drivers aren't very good drivers or they're being disingenuous for the sake of argument, aren't they?
No. Immediately after is 18th Ave. You had time.

Again. Never go north. Can't imagine the chaos you would cause on Rt. 22.
Thank you for recognizing you're making a dumbass aggressive assumption.
You didn't get off at the very immediate exit, so it was not THAT immediate. 

You are clearly extremely still upset by this. I've seen a ton of stuff on r/Roadcam and r/idiotsincars, and this was not that insane.

Part of driving is that even if someone is doing something wrong, you need to do what you can to avoid an accident. Did you do that? Sort of. You saw a bunch of cars trying to merge in. Whenever I see that, I do my best to avoid it if I can. 

Not every road design is going to be perfect. These merges are hard because you need to go in at full speed, and stopping fully at a yield makes it more dangerous. 

This may not have been one of the most dangerous merges in the state, but we would all be happier if we just worked together. 

And no one is ""giving you shit,"" we are just making suggestions for how you could have avoided this. 

I got downvoted before and I'll probably get downvoted for this. 

Next time you need to do a crazy merge into the parkway or some other intense road, let's see how you feel when no driver wants to give you the space to do it safely.
You never even reach the exit in this video. You easily could have made it. 

For the third (?) time, not defending the truck. They were wrong. You're going to run into a lot of drivers in New Jersey doing stupid shit like this. It's frustrating, but that's reality.

Just get to where you need to get without dying or provoking someone to do crazy shit like throw a drink at you. In this case, that would have meant slowing down or moving over, which were both clearly safe options.

Swerving halfway into the other lane while honking, and then wasting your Sunday stewing about it, was not the best course of action. This easily could have been a non-event.
Eh, you could have moved back. Either way, it's not that big of a deal. Kids are stupid and overreact, especially in the early stages of driving.
You are saying two opposing things. You said they were right but they also should have taken different actions, so you don‚Äôt really think their actions were in the right. 

You are saying that the person with the right of way determines who they let merge onto the road and that isn‚Äôt the case (‚Äúyou let the white car merge‚Äù). 

The person with the right of way should maintain steady speed and let the merging cars speed up or slow down to properly merge. 

If you have the right of way and speed up to prevent a car from merging ahead of you, that would be wrong, but that isn‚Äôt the case here.
My point still fucking stands. What is that, a quarter of a mile? No. I‚Äôm not moving over for a quarter of a mile for this chucklefuck to not let me back into the lane.
I am not extremely upset by the situation, I think you‚Äôre completely misreading my tone. What I think is wild is you are focusing on my driving rather than the fact that two teenagers are driving a several thousand pound vehicle recklessly, hanging out of a window, cutting people off, and throwing bottles at other cars. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs normal but you are trying to make it normal.
If you did move over, or swallowed your pride and slowed down, you would be having a normal Sunday and not crying on Reddit. Again, not saying they were right, but this wasn't that big of a deal at all. It's about getting where you need to go, not getting bent out of shape from rude drivers IN NEW JERSEY of all places. Our trademark is rude drivers. Safe travels, bud.
That's a fair point. I just try not to honk huge pickup trucks nowadays because I assume they're driven by gun-carrying lunatics.
I was going below the speed limit, buddy. It‚Äôs bold of you to focus on me instead of the idiots who were speeding, tailgating the car in front of them, then running a yield cutting me off, brake checking me, and then throwing a drink at me. Are those your kids or something?
Thank you, I appreciate it. You‚Äôre right and as a whole I‚Äôve been trying to honk less myself.
Sorry that one of our schools failed to provide you with reading comprehension. I'm not defending them. I'm saying all this was easily avoidable.
Sorry that your drivers ed failed you thinking that I should accommodate people who don‚Äôt yield to traffic!
Yes, by the truck yielding to oncoming traffic like the sign they blew past suggested. It‚Äôs a yield, not a merge. OP did nothing wrong and I feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills because it‚Äôs lunacy to suggest anything otherwise.
I agree with you. The lane is yours and you have right-of-way in that scenario. You move over as a courtesy not because you have to.
I couldn‚Äôt believe the responses. The kid is literally sitting outside the window of the truck. How are we focusing on whether or not I should have moved over?
Thank you! I don‚Äôt understand why anyone think I wouldn‚Äôt? I was going to be getting off right away!"

While I can't pretend I've extensively seen the entirety of the greens of jersey, I just spent roughly 40 hours on trains this last week in Germany.

God I wish we looked like and had the amount of green they do.
new jersey has long history of German and Italian immigrants. of course they will bring over their farming techniques.
Except in Germany the people have wanderweg. Which opens endless trails to walk and bike.
Go look at Wisconsin and you'll see why there is a huge German population there.
I've never seen pic of jersey so green.
I will be flying over tonight taking the train from Frankfurt down into Bavaria.  The country side reminds me of northwest NJ and central PA heading towards state college. Lots of rolling farmland.
most of Germany looks like PA/NJ which is why so many came over
Bro where does it look like that in nj
Wait til you hear we both have a neighboring city called Strasbourg / stroudsburg
Yeah but without 9000 bad drivers
Where exactly is the second photo?
New Germany
I always felt like it reminds me of PA but nj makes sense too
Ireland is the NJ of Europe
I can say that NJ does have less lederhosen per capita than Germany.
I can relate. I go 2x/year to Germany and they have some similarities. The Reggio reminds me of NJ transit.
Around Andover in the 1930s, New Jersey would remind you of Germany.
My dad calls it New Germany cuz he doesn't like the gun laws lol
They DO call NJ the Garden State!
If you're comparing geography, the Rheinland-Pfalz region might be the closest match to New Jersey.
Ich bin ein Pork Roll. Bitte!
Agreed.
Not sure, people in Germany move aside for emergency vehicles on the highway
Bro what. Pretty sure most countries have similar looking green hills. This isn't NJ or Germany exclusive. You could change the name from Germany to Slovenia and I'd believe it.
Skylands, Germany.
Oh yeah
Have you ever seen the German Coast on the North Sea?

[https://www.grida.no/resources/4035](https://www.grida.no/resources/4035)
What?? I don't even see a sinkhole in site!
Germany is roughly 18 times the size of New Jersey and has about 8 times the population. Germany has four cities with a population over 1 million and about 15 cities with a population over 500,000. By comparison New Jersey doesn't have a single city over 500,000 - its largest city being around 300,000 and the combined population of the five largest cities in the state coming in at around 1 million. 

Germany's average elevation above sea level is 850 feet. The average elevation of New Jersey is about 250 feet. Only a quarter of the sixteen states of Germany touch the ocean. A third of the counties of New Jersey touch the ocean. 

New jersey has MUCH more in common with The Netherlands than it does with Germany. The Netherlands has a high population density, but there's no city with over a million people and only two with a population over half a million. Like New Jersey, the Netherlands is largely defined by its coast and the sea is and always has been an important part of the country's history and cultural identity. The average elevation of The Netherlands is about 100 feet, so it's relatively flat - like New Jersey. It's highly urbanized without having loads of big sprawling cities, and like New Jersey The Netherlands is great about taking care of its nature. It has a small area but a great amount of protected natural areas and wilderness areas. 

Germany has much more in common with much larger, more populous, more built-up US states than it does with NJ. The Netherlands is easily the closest in a lot of ways - geographically, demographically, in terms of weather, character, culture, you name it. And you know what? That's a huge compliment for both the Dutch and New Jerseyans as both The Netherlands and New jersey boast a really high standard of living, they're both relatively and comparatively safe by American/European standards, both the Dutch and New Jerseyans tend to be more educated than their neighbours, and they're both seen as clean, safe places to go on holiday, especially to their respective coasts.
Jersey is great but after living here for 20 years. I am just so bored.  I was in Germany last year, the freshness attracted me.  The new car smell.
nothing alike at all, even in heavier german areas
The train system in both isn't reliable
Does Germany have a doppelg√§nger for Camden and Newark as well?
Initial airport experience upon arriving at Newark compared to Germany is wild
No way. New jersey is not the beautiful. Trust me i live here...it sucks ass
Where in NJ is that second picture?
No thanks
Both have no speed limit on the highway
We both curse up a storm too
They had Berghof and we have Bedminster.
They had Bund camps, we had Bund camps
Fleischwurst should be closer to pork roll. Equally versatile.
Newsflash. We have bratwurst too, and even knockwurst.  /s. Although it‚Äôs hard to find good potato dumplings and rouladen.

Good points. Except NJ doesn't have the Dutch style toilets.

THANK GOD FOR THAT.
I'm so sorry you live in between Newark Airport and the Linden Cogen plant. That area really does suck ass. The rest of the state is quite beautiful, though.
Should try exploring more of NJ
We have strongly worded suggestions of limit.
What‚Äôs the Autobahn‚Äôs sinkhole situation?
Underappreciated comment
Oof. Too true. The site of a former bund camp in a town near me is now a gravel mine so that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ Something I guess.
Newsflash. They may have the Wittenburg Castle, but we have White Castle. The Germans can't replicate those tender, juicy, steam grilled patties even if they wanted to.
That‚Äôs the fun part the ALP46/45DP is legit based off the DB Class 101/Bombardier Traxx respectively

Unless you mean train density in which case ABSOLUTELY
I'm very mixed on this haha.

After these last few weeks, it's seriously awesome how nice the trains were, and especially how connected the Schengen area was (with a rail pass, 8 bucks to get a nice ride from Germany to Belgium!)

But I also got some of the bad, I had a 6 hour delay one day caused by an attempt (I believe success, staff didn't tell us), and dear God the fucking chaos when a single route goes down!


Obviously it blows us out of the water public transport wise, but I'll be honest I don't think Id be able to give up my car
I live near and work in Medford lmao. There's a difference.

In NJ we have towns, cities, and a bit of green.
 In Germany they green, green, and a side of city.

Born and raised, I love NJ, but random farmland in places like Salem isn't the same haha.
Reverse image searching the second NJ photo suggests UK though?

Warren and Sussex are in North Jersey
Beautiful. They remind me of when I watch shows based in England and Ireland. I always admired the 5 countryside, not knowing it's just an hour or two away.
I think I need to.
Exactly, we have the giant lookout over the valley which looks exactly like this - nobody ever seems to know what Long Valley is in this state, so I guess that explains why they don't think these photos could be NJ lol
lol I grew up in Sussex‚Ä¶no. Definitely not rich. Very beautiful though. I was always very confused when people talked shit about NJ being dirty. And a lot of people saying that in Brooklyn no less.
That's morris and hunterdon.  Warren/sussex isn't rich.  Sussex has some richer folks, but it's nothing crazy.

Do not encourage that sort.
And when driving through Morris county the speed limit isnt a limit but warning sign. Approach and ye shall be ticketed.
Yes, I meant density and schedule. Japan too. Was in Japan for the first time last year. Wanted to take the bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto. It was off-season, so no need for advance reservations. Seven trains per hour!


Recently I may have needed to take a train from Allentown to Philadelphia...one per dayüòï
The way the US is going it‚Äôll be 100 years before we ever have high speed rail. Definitely keep your car.
Germany has much better land use laws. They don‚Äôt allow sprawl so the population centers grow out from the center, not willy-nilly, so that they can preserve their farmland should they try to conquer the world again.
Would be hilarious if it was Sussex, UK
Visit the Water Gap.  I've been to nearly every national park and it's prettier than some of them.  The green is just starting up here, usually by mid april it's fully greened.  

It's funny because the way I drive to work is gorgeous but it wasn't really til I started traveling that I noticed it.

reminds me of Pennington during my college days.  got a speeding ticket, had to go to court.  All 70ish people there were traffic tickets for the circle.  1 woman was 1 mph over the limit, the judge enforced it.
Even with DB‚Äôs delays, it would be a 100% improvement over our system
Thanks. I did a 360. It really is beautiful country.
Short Hills isn't South Jersey either lol
New Jersey is the Wales of America or more appropriately, Wales is the Germany of the .U.K.
That's my view almost every day for commute :) can't complain too much.
They're not saying Short Hills is in south jersey, they're saying THEY are from south jersey
Ok. But that photo isn‚Äôt in NJ.
Yea Short Hills is as north as it gets in my mind

South Jersey is more beautiful to me, like Italy. South Jersey supremacy forever
My apologies I should‚Äôve done more research. This was just a 4am shitpost. Googled New Jersey countryside and found this photo which linked to the article top 5 rural counties in New Jersey. I took the New Jersey 101.5 at their word. I wish I had double checked because there are images of New Jersey that look exactly like that photo.
Which is pretty funny because Short Hills is like an hour and a half from as north as it gets in NJ.
All good! I wasn‚Äôt trying to be a buzz kill it just looks like a cool location and I was trying to locate it bc if it was local I would wanna go there lol"

Cheaper ways to get to NYC from Trenton?,"I was told that I can go to Hamilton Station and take the train to NY Penn Station, but I‚Äôm just wondering are there cheaper routes? I wanna go to NYC tomorrow since I just moved here (to NJ).

Gas and tolls would make driving more expensive
Drive to Newport Center mall in Jersey City (parking is $15 for 4-6 hours I forget the fee for more time), walk across the street to the Path station and take the Path for $3
Welcome to New Jersey!

I believe the train from Hamilton to NYC Penn is the least expensive option you have at the moment.  If you live closer to Trenton Transit Center than Hamilton, you could also take the train from there to NY Penn.  It's about a $1 more, but it'll probably be easier if you're closer to there.  Driving or taking a taxi/Uber will be significantly more expensive, and I don't believe there's a bus route running at the moment.

This won't apply for right now because Amtrak tickets get pricey when you try to buy last minute, but if you know specific times you'll be in NYC that are at least a month or more in advance, unless it's a holiday, you can also usually get decent prices on Amtrak, and often, it'll be less expensive than NJ Transit if you plan in advance.
That IS the cheapest way to
Lol what would you want as options cheaper than public transport?
could also drive to harrison, all day parking is 12 dollars at the lot next to the path station, but if you've never taken the path from harrison it can get confusing with the switch up at journal square
IIRC, you can take a much cheaper NJ Transit train from Trenton or Hamilton,  instead of Amtrak.
Thank you!!! 

Also what is a Light Rail? When I go on the NJ Transit app, there are so many options to book a ticket through. But Im assuming I‚Äôd select just regular Rail lol. Also, do you know if military discounts are offered? I see senior/disabled, but nothing military but am just wondering. Thank you for all the information
I agree that usually NJ Transit is gonna be far less expensive than Amtrak, but if OP knows for sure they wanna go to NYC on a specific date and that date is pretty far out, it'll probably be less expensive than NJ Transit.

For example, I randomly chose May 24 since it's a Saturday and two months from now to check just now, and there's a ticket going for $15 for 9:09 AM, 1:05 PM, 3:13 PM, and 5:17 PM.   They're all for the Keystone train too, which is a much nicer train than what NJ Transit uses.  NJ Transit would always be around $18-19
I just searched it up, and it looks like they do have a discount for you, but it looks like you have to present a VA or military ID card if buying in-person, or you can buy the ticket for Seniors on the NJ Transit app or vending machines and show your VA ID card to the conductor when riding the train: [https://www.njtransit.com/military](https://www.njtransit.com/military)
No worries at all!  I totally understand it can be confusing when first moving here as someone who just moved to New Jersey last year.

The light rail is New Jersey's version of the subway, and there's several of them throughout the state, but a specific light rail almost always sticks to the city it's a part of.  In your case, you're right that you'll be taking the Regular Rail instead.

I'm not in the military nor a veteran so I'm not too sure about military discounts, but I know for sure Amtrak offers them because I've seen it advertised on their website.  With NJ Transit, I don't think I've ever seen it on the NJ Transit app, but I would be surprised if they didn't have one when you buy tickets in-person at a station if you showed some kind of ID
ahhh thank you so much!! you‚Äôve been very helpful
No problem at all, hope you have a nice trip and that you love NYC and New Jersey!  Welcome again
one last question if that‚Äôs okay. so when i‚Äôm about to buy the ticket, it doesn‚Äôt have it to where i can select the time i‚Äôm wanting to board the train? does the time not matter; does a time not have to be selected?
No worries at all for asking!  You got it right.  Usually, tickets get a month before they expire, and they don't have to be for a specific time which is the benefit of buying a NJ Transit ticket over an Amtrak ticket.  You just have to pick the correct departure and destination.  You'll activate the ticket before you board and then show it to the conductor when they come around
you are so awesome thank you so much again. you‚Äôve really helped ease my anxiety for tomorrow! i‚Äôm really excited. i‚Äôve been to NYC once before, but didn‚Äôt get to explore much like i wanted to. i‚Äôm here in NJ on orders so it‚Äôs my new home for awhile. i‚Äôm so excited to be able to travel around and get a feel of city life. thank you kind stranger!
No problem at all, I'm glad to hear this was helpful!  Hope you get to see what you want in New York and that you have a great time living in New Jersey
hiii i have another question üò≠how do i get from NY Penn Station to Brooklyn (will public transportation get me there)? There‚Äôs a vinyl shop there in Brooklyn that has a vinyl I‚Äôve been looking for. It‚Äôs on Banker Street if that helps

They replaced a windshield in the parking lot where I work. I had to leave the car overnight to let the glue or whatever fully cure, but they came to me and did the job right. The other glass replacements were done in my driveway. Always friendly and professional - as expected from a large chain.
Wow i never would have thought of tipping the tech. Is that expected ?
I second SafeLite - done in my driveway about 5 years ago.  The tech asked me if I had any coupons - I said no - he said, if you got a phone book - lo and behold - 25% off.  I tipped him well.
I have no deductible comprehensive insurance, so I didn't pay a thing. Just the tip to the tech.

With all the gravel trucks spewing debris on the freeways - I need glass replacement every couple of years. I wonder if it is just a Jersey thing. The cover they have to prevent this often flaps in the wind and I think it makes it even worse.
It was my 1996 Dodge Ram - not worth getting comprehensive insurance.   On my new cars that have full coverage,  I have never had an issue."

> $10 for a drink

That's just NJ life now; frankly $10 is on the lower end for anything outside an anheiser-bush beer. We're neck-and-neck with coastal CA for highest COL - consequence of high demand & population density

> everyone is weird and annoying

You chose to hit AC in the offseason, that's 100% on you man. Last time I made that mistake, a shirtless fella in a parking lot tried to sell me a hand-drawn cartoon that certainly infringed on Disney IP & got VERY upset when I wasnt interested. Asbury is a MUCH better urban destination this time of year
AC is absolutely not the same as it once was. In some respects, it's maybe a good thing that parts of it are being ""redeveloped"", but the stuff being built / added in/ ""revitalized"" is very ....bougie would be the word.


Same with all the ""luxury apartments"" going up everywhere.
AC has always been a little sketch for me,  but I accept it for what it is. A lot of hidden gems for eating and drinking. Half the fun is finding them. Some areas you go to some you don't. If the whole place was nice and beautiful, you'll be complaining about the min $40 drinks. 

Rooms that are getting more expensive and facilities that are not being maintained is more of an issue than the surroundings.
AC has been drugs and sad broke people that have gambling problems mixed with an expensive club scene for as long as i can remember

It really hasnt been a family place for decades
Atlantic City has always been crappy
It‚Äôs the influx of NY crowd moving to Jersey and bringing those ridiculous prices and shitty attitudes with them.
The weird comma usage and your disenchantment with AC has me questioning a lot‚Ä¶
Welcome to nostalgia.
nah dude, AC is a tourist trap for trashy people.  it always has been to some extent, but rotting things tend to get worse and worse with time.
New Yorkers have invaded during RONA.
No such thing as classic NJ.  Those weird and annoying people are the same weird and annoying people that have always been there.  You are just less full of your youthful self and more aware of the world around you.  

Enjoy.
Umm you aren't the same as 20 years ago either. 
10 dollars for a drink isn't bad esp in a tourist area. 
You seem to be stuck  in a  time warp.
$10 a drink ain‚Äôt shit, you most not get out much, AC is trash so I suggest not going
BYOB
A classic Benny maybe
AC is a cracked out town no bigger than Hackensack with a boardwalk. It‚Äôs been weird for decades. Casinos and resort in the Poconos are a more viable getaway alternative during the winter/early spring for a lot of gamblers in the tri-state/philly areas.
I was also born and raised in nj, wtf is six flags? Similar to great adventure maybe ü§î just kidding
You like the space bar at weird times.
..ya lost huh?
AC needs a major revamp. They need to just clear out that whole boardwalk and build new attractions or focus on cleaning the beach. Place is a desolate wasteland with how it is now.
AC is for the tourists.
Hey I also came back from AC this past weekend, specifically Tropicana.  I spent $7 for a Gatorade and $17 for a chicken sandwhich.   I havent been here in awhile to remember if this normal but luckily for Houston beating Gonzaga they paid for it.
AC is for foreigners & tourists!
NJs gone through some pretty insane changes in the past 15 years alone. Not just ACü•≤
Only solution is to just not buy. The price has to make sense IMO. 10 bucks for a drink is wild. That drink better get me tipsy atleastt.
everything is getting more expensive and certain towns are getting trashier by the day
Wow, things aren‚Äôt exactly as I remember them being 30 years ago? What fuckery is this?
kingda ka is gone which is all you need to know  
but yeah i agree the vibes have gone downhill nearly everywhere in the state
You got old.
You seem like the weird annoying one. Jersey's the same as it every was
I think the things you mentioned still exist but you need to look a bit harder for them. 

Obviously money is money but good things can be found so long as you got good people around you. There are great communities, hidden gems, activities, restaurants that don‚Äôt cost an arm and a leg, and experiences in this state. 

If a place or activity feels weird or not worth it, it‚Äôs just maybe not for you. So just a bit more exploring is needed and there are plenty of amazing hole in the wall places and fun things to do.
It‚Äôs not just jersey- any of the major economic and financial centers of the US has seen this. LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, even Miami are seeing their prices go up faster than the rest of the country, and NJ is two cities in one so makes sense that it‚Äôs happening here
AC is a trash hole
AC has always been a rip off but I hear you. In 2018 I went to Switzerland and saw a $6 pint of Brooklyn lager on the menu, had to get it. Back in NJ it‚Äôs $8 and in NY it‚Äôs $10
Philly club/bar most drinks are $18.
The world is different my friend
Nope AC is a complete shit hole these days.
$10 drinks, where? I paid $22 for an old fashioned a few weeks ago.
2 slices of za and a coke for $6 3x a week when I have to commute to work.

Inflation is a thing, but the real difference is that we're in an environment so perfectly suited to extract wealth in a way that hasn't happened, in my mind, recorded history.

In the past (early 1900s), going out to eat was an event. Folks understood that ownership of homes was a mixture of good fortune and planning. Post WWII, until the fall of the Soviet Union, capitalism solved a lot of these problems where people felt their kids would do better than them.

Around the same time, the modern day was beginning to come to age at the start of the internet age as we understand it. While more gains occurred, business also adapted to be better at getting in your head longer with greater competition, in less time, and if you don't take risks, you'll essentially never make it.

Things that have always existed, like inflation, will always exist. Good luck and bad luck have been fixtures of the human experience.The internet and business adapt to ad delivery devices that we carry with us from the time we wake up until we go to sleep, and that's not something society has sat with long enough to try and figure out how massive that is. Unless you're someone who's measuring the $ coming in and counting each $ before it goes out, you can lose yourself to nature and not even realize it.

The truth is that humans on the aggregate (ourselves included) are anxious hairless apes. While our ego is that we have control over our lives, what if the things we can not exist in our modern world without are giving businesses higher agency in our decisions than ourselves? It is not insurmountable or impossible, but the longer you've been digging blind, the longer it'll take you to come out with clear eyes.
AC has always been weird and annoying.
A lot of NJ lost its small town charm bc of all of the rich people coming and buying up land to build mcmansions
Where the hell are you finding $10 drinks? Must be talking beer or hard seltzer
Another the good old days post.
Weird, like entitled and stuck up? I agree.
most people dont waste their time going to casinos and crying about $10 drinks lol

$10+ drinks anywhere at at all nice has been a thing for at least 15 years

you are cheap and delusional op
Not delusional. AC is a freakshow now.
AC gets a lot of the NewYork crowd and it‚Äôs always been kind of sad. Lots of retirees gambling away their social security checks.
Some places are better, some are worse for activities.

Obviously it's a big step away, but if you want to drink on holiday, get a flight and go to Cologne.

I just spent 3 days there with one of my mates and for the basics you can nab beer for as cheap as ‚Ç¨2.5 per cup and we practically made a new group of friends every night because people were happy as hell

Obviously that's a big step away from NJ though. I've never really liked the drinking scene here, especially in AC, and bar neighbors I don't really remember a time people were notably nicer haha.
No Benny here and nah been out of this country and out of this state multiple times . It just different‚Äî- it‚Äôs also the vibe , yes AC has beeeeeennnn sketchy I  remember when trump used to land his helicopter by the boardwalk and walk to his hotel and showgirls would dance on the stairs by hard rock . It‚Äôs not the price Jersey always been expensive but I got two slices last week and a joes iced tea for $15 üò≠ up in north jersey. It just feels different I was born and raised here but the crowd in AC is not the same weirdos I saw growing up . Let me not even get started about asbury please I remember when they had needles on the beach and now the ocean hotel goes for $795 a night , nj vibe is just totally different doesn‚Äôt feel local anymore does that make sense ?
Same, this was only back in 2008-2013 or so I remember going to Mikes Pizza in Brick and getting $1 slices
Literally just had this conversation with my father about meat prices. He said ""I dont think we will see it at $X anytime soon.  And I said I dont think we will see meat prices that low ever again"".  Im at that stage of old where I look at the cost of everything and say wtf
$1.50 went a surprisingly long way even in this millennium. I remember scraping for quarters everywhere to try and find enough to walk to the spot for a pizza and a drink
I was gonna say, when I was a kid I remember getting 50 cent hotdogs on the boardwalk by the beach. üò≠
Just a pedantic economics correction: a small rate of inflation is optimal for the economy and encourages investment instead of hoarding cash. Prices going up themselves isn‚Äôt really a problem as long as it‚Äôs constant and predictable, which allows wages rise with it, canceling the effect.
I went to an Asian country a few months ago and spent $7.50 on a cocktail. $1k/month is a good salary there. Prices have gone up worldwide. It's not a US thing.¬†


$10 cocktails have been the norm for a while.¬†
Seriously though, AC has always been weird and annoying
Asbury is better, period, unless you're specifically going for gambling.
It's not just you. Atlantic City, in particular, is really going down the tubes. And they've been circling the drain for a while. It's interesting that you should post this, because I just read this article yesterday and they discuss a lot of what you experienced. I have a feeling that if Atlantic City doesn't veer off its gambling- centric goals, they're going to completely wash out. They need to make it a family amusement place again. Like it was in the old days.

[AC article ](https://www.casino.org/news/atlantic-city-casino-guests-express-frustrations/)
Just to clarify‚Ä¶we are not ‚Äúneck and neck‚Äù with coastal California in terms of cost of living. We‚Äôre definitely not cheap, sitting at #46 in COL (Cali is 50). But that‚Äôs also statewide ranking; the COL in *coastal* California is wildly more expensive than the rest of the state, and doesn‚Äôt even come close to the COL in most of NJ. 

But statistics aside, having moved back to Jersey a year ago from coastal SoCal I can tell you the difference is stark. TBH, the difference in COL was one of the biggest reasons I moved back‚Ä¶for all the sticker shock of housing costs here in r/newjersey, and it is high, it‚Äôs absolute peanuts compared to coastal Cali.
Here I am thinking hey drinks have been $10 for like 10 years now so that‚Äôs pretty good for AC.
>We're neck-and-neck with coastal CA for highest COL - consequence of high demand & population density

Massachusetts would like a word...
>¬†We're neck-and-neck with coastal CA for highest COL - consequence of high demand & population density

Not even close. ¬†Open up Zillow and look up how much land costs in coastal California. ¬†Not to mention higher fossil fuel and electricity costs, higher minimum wage (they don‚Äôt even have a lower tipped wage) and stricter overtime laws (after 8 hours in a day), etc.
This right here. I am a south jersey resident so much less of all that north jersey bullshit you speak of. Sure we had cheap good pizza and all but we don‚Äôt make our childhoods sound like a Bruce Springsteen song lol. That being said I am 40 and have been surfing year round since I was 14. If you are just realizing AC is weird in March then you aren‚Äôt a real ‚Äújersey guy.‚Äù As far as inflation? Yeah that shit sucks.
Off season ? That didn‚Äôt exist in NJ ? I came with fake ID this is new.
It's got way further to go though. They're still struggling with corruption since apparently everyone has to ""talk"" to Party Marty to get their permits.
That's because Clout Chasing has become our national pastime.
I went to Oceans on a weekday. Sick room great price. Amada & the spa were as expected. Very good but a tad expensive, but thats the deal. What I was surprised about was the subtle mess in the hotel hallways. Looked like they weren‚Äôt being vacuumed.
It was never really a family place‚Ä¶ unless you had a gambling addicted relative. But that‚Äôs like calling driving around town checking each bar for dad ‚Äúfamily time‚Äù.
My late grandmother said AC was dazzling in the ‚Äò40s.
Comas, while scary at first glance, can be medically very useful. Dr Spaceman has a pamphlet on this
I want to know what the missing item is after classic NJ.
OP just learning about inflation for the first time
10 dollars for a drink? Where does this dude live where this is expensive???
Came here to say this. I've never heard someone from Jersey say 'Six Flags.'  It's ALWAYS Great Adventure!
asbury is also crazy expensive now. didn't used to be like that a few years back at least the pizza and candy places my friends and i used to go to
Hey so am I still drunk or did you just go from talking ab AC and then casually transition to ‚Ä¶  France? 

I‚Äôm def laughing like l am so it‚Äôs possible‚Ä¶

As you've apparently been in a coma for a long time: go look at real estate prices in Asbury.
It‚Äôs so weird that you have that memory when about 2 weeks ago, you posted you were 32 and looking to buy a used car.
I graduated 2010. I remember our local pizza place that I‚Äôd walk to in high school had 2 slices and a drink for $3.75. No idea what that combo costs now if it even exists.¬†
Those were the days
Mikes pizza was fucking awesome. I remember my grandparents would walk me up Sky Manor back in the 90s and get a slice.
Man. You remind me of being home by myself for an hour or so as a kid (unheard of now). Sometimes I would get hungry and scrounge for change in my parent‚Äôs office, gather $3.00 in quarters and get a ham and cheese with lettuce, tomato and mayo on a roll. Deli owner would get so mad at me, and I never knew why. üòÇ
Except wages haven't kept up with it for decades.
Hell, Id argue paterson is a better destination than modern AC, but maybe OP wanted to see the sights one more time before it [literally falls into the ocean](https://whyy.org/articles/atlantic-city-new-jersey-vulnerable-sea-level-rise-flooding-study/)
As bury is better ? Asbury had needles on the beach üò≠üò≠üò≠ have you seen asbury 06-09???? Lmfao better yeah the gown is better but I want to pay $13 for a cocktail and $2.50 oyster gtfo
The fact that people can sports bet and gamble on their phones from the comfort of their homes is a big hit to AC. Even Vegas moved to include more shows and family events years back when they needed to. AC needs to get something that would bring people back to the area that they can't get from home.
AC can be a nice city, but the work that needs to be put in is massive. The casinos are a big roadblock that's gonna keep dragging it down.
AC was great back in the late 90s early 2000s for me and when the world series of poker became popular.  The clubs and bars were filled with good looking people (on a Saturday night, Fri was always the weirdos).  Trop was actually good for partying, Borgata was the best and had the hottest woman on Saturday nights.  Not sure when it changed but it did, Saturday nights are nothing like they used to be.

The hell are you talking about there has *always* been an off season. It's busy in the summer, falls off hard in the fall, absolutely crashes in the winter aside from holidays and conventions, and slowly picks back up again.

This isn't new. There is nothing hard to understand about a beach resort town not getting business in the dead of winter when it's shitty, cold, and there is no beach to swim at.
Ocean is very nice.
The only good part of AC is the area between Ocean and Hard Rock.

As I said, a *small* amount of inflation is fine. My point is that looking at the sticker price of something 30 years ago and being shocked that it has risen is a little reductive because of course the nominal prices will increase. It‚Äôs built into the system.

High inflation is a problem though.

Spend enough time in AC, and you'll find needles there, too. Probably more.
You're behind the times, place is gentrified with luxury condos, at least the beachside of the train tracks is
I guarantee AC has more needles. I used to volunteer to feed the stray cats under the boardwalk‚Ä¶.. it was a minefield under there.
I mean yeah it sounds like you‚Äôre just not cut out for the modern day and age lol

Some dude grew up in nj before you, the whole deal, and he probably thought it was fucking disgusting that they tore down all the downtowns and put up shopping malls. Selling $4 coffees.

Time goes forward, the value of money goes down and life gets more expensive. You‚Äôre not the first or last feel this
Asbury has been largely gentrified. Some waterfront condos go for a million and there are some really great bars and restaurants.
And AC doesn‚Äôt?
it's gentrified now bud, took it a long time but it happened thanks to the gays buying up property, renoving it.

I totally agree. The city officials feel totally inept me. And have been for a long time. I think going almost all gambling as the focus was the biggest mistake the city ever made.
Yeah it was. The showers were out of control
Same. But Asbury Park used to be the cesspool of Jersey, and now it‚Äôs hopping. Lots of out of state young people move in. AC is just ugly and depressed today. A talented developer could probably boost it, like what was done with Vegas. Nowhere to go but up!

You're missing the point, it's not the level inflation that matters so much, it's wages relative to inflation. High inflation over an extended period still matters because it can make people's saving worthless, but if people can't even make enough to save much, low inflation doesn't matter.
Let me correct you: there are people living in relative poverty there.
Youre arguing with someone who agrees with you.  They are just trying to explain that inflation is actually good, to a degree.
High inflation is bad. Wage stagnation is bad. Nobody is disputing that. But it‚Äôs not some evil conspiracy to defraud the people like I keep seeing on other threads in this sub. Inflation is an inherent part of the system, and a little inflation (<2%) encourages long term investment, which is good. 

You‚Äôre not arguing the same point that I‚Äôm making, which is that comparing nominal prices across time is meaningless because money is neutral in the long term.
[removed]
That's in a world where you can invest your money and historically (ie wait decades) beat inflation by a few points.  In today's world of Walmart and Amazon workers we don't see the same level of investing. It's not like those workers can even save in the traditional very low yield way, much less invest in a vehicle which will gain long term.  

Some companies do offer some form of profit sharing, which is a good start.  I believe Amazon, as one example, gives a 50% match up to a certain % of pay. I'm just not sure if it's particularly viable especially when the base salary won't even pay for a basic living standard, much less investing.  But it's better than nothing. It's difficult to find an average, but NJ average for Amazon fulfillment center seems to be around $24/hour = @ $50k assuming a 40 hour work week/52 weeks.

My point is that the traditional <2% inflation paradigm to stimulate the economy may just not be working as well for blue collar workers anymore.  There was a time when they had pensions, and/or enough disposable income where they could invest (and spend to stimulate the economy) beyond an emergency fund, mortgage, health ins, taxes, necessities, groceries, etc.  These days 30-80% (depending on the study/survey) are living paycheck to paycheck.
I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs trying to hide it:poverty is what it is. Meanwhile houses east of the tracks are going for millions. No need to be rude.
None of what you said disproves my point.

Investment means many things and affects everything in the economy. Not just personal investment. If banks have no incentive to loan out money because it will be worth more tomorrow, they would be more conservative in making capital or other investments for businesses, which in turn reduces jobs, which reduces wages, and so on. A small and predictable inflation rate lubricates the overall economy. 

In addition, deflation is a disastrous phenomenon that is very difficult to reverse because it spirals so quickly. Inflation is also a buffer against deflation.
Not trying to disprove your point at all."

Kept the weight 5 lbs less than the limit (which I think was 30 pounds) and put them out accordingly. 


If it's metal, it's pretty easy to dismantle them to small pieces. If it's wood, and you have a miter saw, still easy. Otherwise ask public works department of the township if they will let you drop it off at their facility. 


Good luck!
Take the debris to the Burlington county transfer station. Pressure treated wood is gonna be higher but doubt it's over 100$
I'm one of the few people in town with the code to access the public works facility (it's only available to business owners but I got a hook up in Nepotismtown!). They won't let me dump the swing set there because it didn't originate IN town. (They already knew where it was coming from.)

These were always written by local people back when local newspapers were actually printed locally. Nowadays they're pretty much all gone.


¬†Some were bought by Gannett or the like, and remain shells of their former selves, still printed even, but look at the bylines and mastheads if you pick up a print copy - papers that used to employ 20 people now employ like 5 local people, 3 of whom are busy with ad sales (not writing news), most of their stories are from AP newswires, the few that remain written locally are local interest stories mostly, sometimes about an important local event like a new school being constructed. There's just not enough people on staff to have police blotters anymore.


I don't have any great ideas for how to solve this. It leaves a huge information gap that social media is clearly shitty at filling in with influencers posting whatever they want without training or fact checking.¬†
Sadly nope , now my friends have no idea what I been up to.
It‚Äôs a time suck and there aren‚Äôt enough local journalists to go around. I did the blotters in central NJ a little around a decade ago. It involved me driving to the station once a week and being given a list of activities I could take notes on but wasn‚Äôt allowed to take with me. (And yes, I believe that this was a deliberate move to make my job harder, obligatory ACAB.) 

The crimes were always petty and things they wanted you to see: car break-ins, teens stealing things from stores, etc. (Another strategic move.) It eventually became a huge waste of time and we were already stretched incredibly thin, so there was no point in going anymore.
I do really miss reading about the trouble my former classmates get into with the law
I remember when The Record newspaper was actually a decent local news source.
Police blotters are online in New Jersey. Either through local police departments or New Jersey on-line news such as TAPinto.net and Patch.com. With safety & crime news specific to your town and NJ in general, just Google specific town police blotters‚Äî ex. Jersey City NJ police blotter. If you really want crime with mugshots Google county prosecutors office for latest crime stories.
Because it affects real estate sales. Developers‚Äô influence has a lot to do with police blotters disappearing.
Some towns still have it. I'm in Monmouth country and the local paper still prints it for the towns that still publish it. So I guess I agree with what the top comment said its the lack of local news in most areas.
They are fascist f-cks, but this site still does police blotters every day, only reason I follow their shit.

It‚Äôs a shame. Now all of the police updates are on Facebook, X or Instagram. None of which I subscribe to.
There‚Äôs a news site called daily voice. Hastily and poorly written but might be enough for you
because no one cares
This is the answer. I was a local county news reporter in the early 2010s and I would go into the police station once a week, look through a binder of recent police reports they kept for me, and write them up in quick 2-3 sentence blotter lines. It was mostly Kohls shoplifting, young adult opioid users stealing from their parents, copper thefts, DUIs, and people leaving their car doors unlocked and getting stuff stolen from them overnight.
What‚Äôs there to solve? I would say it probably existed because boomers and their parents loved reading about small time drug arrests and other petty crime.  Though I don‚Äôt recall the book directly criticizing police blotter ‚ÄúRise of the Warrior Cop‚Äù really goes into detail about the fetishization of the modern police force.  I don‚Äôt need to read about every teenager busted for a gram of weed in the last week.
I laughed my ass off when I read that my cousin got pinched in Boonton for weed.
My town always used to send them out via email, it seems that stopped around CoViD times. Perhaps they perceived a lack of interest from but the person recording and the public, and never reinstated it.

Admittedly, there was more ""underage drunk crashes car"" than real crime, so it did get repetitive and ""boring"".
Our paper enacted a policy to not publish names in the blotter for precisely this reason
there are pros and cons to it. On one hand, your friends story. On the other the public having visibility into police actions. 

Its tough to draw the line. 20 years ago, it wasn't something that would follow you, nobody was searching the archives of your town paper for your history. It was either on your record or not. 

Now if you get arrested and you have a unique name, or the story finds a larger audience, that will be what the first 5 pages of a google shows someone who runs your name, and the 2 or 3 stories someone bothers to print saying everything was dismissed and it was mistaken identity might show up around page 20.
But they are and this is just not true
I'm pleasantly surprised to meet someone who actually used to do this in the comment sections here. I studied Journalism in college from 06 to 08 before switching to web design before I graduated in '11. I only switched away from journalism because of the stories I heard about how the crazy hope I had, that The Internet would just bring Newspapers Online and Reporters Would Still Have Jobs, was not true at all. So I've always had a sorta time-warped FOMO in the fact that I never even had a great chance to try my hand at the field, which seemed like a really interesting job. Being able to report on a new story every day looked like it would be hard for the job to get old. Too bad the industry completely fell apart between the year I was born and the year I graduated college.
> It was mostly Kohls shoplifting, young adult opioid users stealing from their parents, copper thefts, DUIs,

I was going to say your beat must have been Toms River, but i didn't see domestic violence mentioned.
I don't care about the police blotter that much, although its existence predates the boomers' reading age by about 100 years. I care about local news disappearing.
My local police blotter is hilarious. They don‚Äôt cover every  boring thing that happens. Recently they had a blurb about a female rugby team that were cited for disorderly behavior after partying it up at a local bar, and then came to the police station the next day to apologize.
Smart move! I wish I had had that kind of foresight. I‚Äôm kind of the opposite, I graduated college the year before you and had too many people telling me to chase my dreams so I spent the next 15 years underpaid and overworked reporting locally, regionally, and then nationally on a lot of different beats. 

You‚Äôre right, it is fun to focus on something new everyday, but after a few years on the same beat a lot of stuff starts to feel the same. Covering the same events/milestones year after year, even covering B2B it can get repetitive. I am genuinely satisfied with the substance of my career though and glad I‚Äôll never wonder ‚Äúwhat if I tried?‚Äù I just also see a lot of people my age rising the ranks and reaching levels I now would love to reach, and at this point wish I just went for an MBA lol. Also they also made time to build lives and find partners and have kids etc., I really just gave it all to the career."

Used car dealership - can you increase deposit / downpayment?,"Edited for clarity. Hopefully easier to read

Here‚Äôs my scenario - I am new NJ/ US resident with no credit score history.

I was at Planet Honda( Google reviews were good but, looking at Reddit now, seems a very bad decision). Liked a car, negotiated OTD (30k). looking at deposit (10k) and finance the rest through loan. They ran my credit and said there is no credit and I have to take loan only through dealer( I tried through my bank separately and loan was rejected). they wouldn‚Äôt say how much as the monthly payments would be , as finance team would be involved only after I conclude sales with sales team and finance team is not available. They say as I don‚Äôt have credit history, my rates could be anything which only finance team can say on Monday. ( worst case is 30% max that is NJ law and expect  25% as I have job etc.)

They refuse to take full cash as I had concerns about signing a deal without understanding monthly payments - their response was that I can always prepay without penalty or increase downpayment on Monday with finance.  They also sort of gave an ultimatum that no deal on negotiated value, if I walk away without a deposit today ( I should have but didn‚Äôt which I recognize now . and ended up paying a 1k deposit)

So here‚Äôs my question - how bad a mess I got myself into? Should I lose the deposit for mental peace or is this solvable? Can I increase downpayment on Monday so I don‚Äôt shell out insane interest rates? Can I prepay an auto loan without any penalty per NJ  rules?

Sorry for the long one - I am new and my experience at car dealerships  has been terrible. Right now, I feel like I caved into pressure after spending hours at dealership and signed a shit agreement where I‚Äôll be forced to pay insane monthly payments.  Pls tell me if I am serious mess or if it‚Äôs a nothing burger. ",1.0,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jholnq/used_car_dealership_can_you_increase_deposit/,14,1jholnq,2025-03-23 01:55,"I would never pay that interest rate and would do my best to buy a car for the $10,000. Or maybe only finance $2,000 to $3,000 to build credit history. 

Every car loan I‚Äôve ever had I have paid off early without penalty. 

Don‚Äôt get pushed into this deal. If you are asking the internet for advice:  my advice is to walk away from that dealer.
You have 10k to put down. Go buy a car worth that. Never agree to this anyone is approved type dealers
a) paragraphs please b) 25% interest rate?! That's worse than an 18 year old buying a dodge charger
There is a lot here so maybe I can help. You are most likely at a buy here pay here dealership. They make their money on the finance (20%+) and are not interested in selling you the car outright. They set a price for finance that would not realistically make sense but you are forced to pay the price because your credit is shot and you need a car. 

To answer your question, yes, the more you put up front the less the monthly payments should be (or the less payments you should make). You have to realize you will pay $X for Y months and both can move. So, for example you can pay $100/mo for 24 months or $200/mo for 12 months and you would be essentially paying the same in principal but you would be paying more for the first scenario because you are borrowing the money for longer (again it's not a perfect example, I'm just trying to show you a point). 

You want them to run the numbers for multiple options - putting down $10k vs $5k. Taking the loan for 2 years vs 3 years. Add all the numbers up and see if it makes financial sense to lay out the money ahead of time.

  
Make sure you take GAP insurance - if you total the car you will owe the bank the difference between what you paid (well over market price) and what it's worth when totaled. Make sure you get full coverage insurance (they should make you) in case you get into an accident you don't end up paying for a vehicle you no longer own.

If they offer a third party warranty through the dealership, take that as well. If they don't honor it, you will have something to fall back on if you stop making payments to a vehicle that no longer works.

  
There are a lot of traps and pitfalls in the market you are looking at. As others suggested you are much better off buying something outright but I do see a benefit to a high interest loan as long as they report to the credit companies to help rebuild. Make sure you make your payments on time. Good luck!
Signing up for a car at over 10% is a terrible decision. You will regret it for a long time.

I'd suggest hit up any used car lot and negotiate any 6-8k car down a grand or two. 

Then work on your credit. Get a credit card and start building credit. Get a respectable score and then go buy a $30k if you really want

Also to note adding more down won't lower the rate in most cases. Will just make the payment a little more manageable.
Get out and get a $10k car from a private seller on fb marketplace

And also try to get your deposit back
Yup, this is where I am at. I am gonna walk away if they force me into clauses I am not comfortable with and think of 1000$ deposit loss as educational fee to remember not to give in.
Thanks, I  did such a bad job. Tried reorganizing it
This is solid advice- yes, don‚Äôt seem to have a lot of options without credit history. I am going to need to push for a larger deposit upfront and prepay loans - what I am not sure is how complicated they‚Äôll make the agreement to stop me from doing it.
I don‚Äôt know man- have two young children and I am at a phase in life and work, where I need things to run. If it was 10 years ago, definitely went to offbeat car dealers.
you should be able to get your $1000 deposit back.  The deposit is to make sure you're a ""serious buyer"".  If there wasn't a deposit, you could run around the entire state 'reserving every car' until you decide which one you wanted.  Same for houses and condos.
How do you have no credit score at this point? I just assumed you were. 20 year old kid.

Electric bill issues,"I live in a building that‚Äôs been haphazardly divided. On the ground floor there is a restaurant. On the second floor there are two offices, my 2BR apartment, and a 1BR apartment. Our electric bill is routinely above $300. All our lights are on timers. We have an electric stove, but we use a toaster oven instead of the oven most of the time. We don‚Äôt have a dishwasher. We have a washer and dryer, but only do laundry two or three times a month (we don‚Äôt have kids). The dryer and perhaps the hot water heater are gas, everything else is electric. We keep our thermostat pretty low, 60-64, most of our heat comes up from downstairs. During the summer we have 3 window units that are kept on energy saver. My partner has a space heater they use when it gets really cold, but I have a dog sleeping in my bed and I don‚Äôt need any extra heat. The other apartment is paying $223 a month, and they have children which means a lot more laundry, but their bill is still lower than ours. 

Our suspicion is that we are paying for electricity for one or more of the other businesses in the building. How can we determine if this is the case? Do we hire an electrician to check out what is connected to our meter? Do we call the electric company? Is there something we can do ourselves? 

One reason I‚Äôm sure at least some of this is going to the wrong meter is that tonight we lost power to some of our kitchen. I found out my neighbor had turned off the breaker to his apartment so he could do some electrical work. 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",0.43,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jhoba7/electric_bill_issues/,4,1jhoba7,2025-03-23 01:40,"Turn off the main breaker for your unit. Then do these two things: 1. See if the meter is still showing usage. If it is then you know that your meter is supplying power to other areas. 2. Wait a few hours. If you have turned off power to one of the businesses someone will come looking to turn it back on.
That seems high. My combines PSEG gas/electric bill was about $450 last month. Quite a bit higher than last year, but not only have rates gone up, the temps were lower too. Double whammy. I have gas heat, hot water, clothes dryer and stove. 2200 sq/ft split level. I'm not looking forward to the June increase right before summer heat really hits.
Call PSE&G and have them come out. Just say that you believe a business in your building is on your meter.

If your lease does not clearly state that you are paying for common area lighting or whatever else it is your meter is hooked up to, it is consumer fraud and you can get treble damages in small claims.  

It's perfectly legal to have you pay other peoples utilities but what you are paying for has to be explicity stated in your lease.
This is a great idea, but unfortunately the main breaker is in the basement, and the only access is through the restaurant."

Last time it was really visible (October 10), the conditions were much stronger. It may still be possible to see between 10 and midnight tonight, but you‚Äôll want to get to a darker area with a good view of the northern horizon. There‚Äôs a few apps to download for the best notifications, so look into downloading:

- Space Weather
- Aurora Forecast 
- Glendale App
- Aurora Now
Naked eye auroras are generally only visible at Kp 9 in NJ. The Kp 8 one that was super bright last year was unusual, anything at 8 or 7 and your best bet will be a dark area (best spots are the beach away from cities and far northwestern NJ as close to the Delaware River as possible), a clear view of the northern horizon, long-exposure photography, luck, and a lot of patience.


I'm not saying it's impossible, but I would not get my hopes up.
At this time of year?

In this part of the country?

Localized entirely within Canada and the northern border states?

Keep these fucks far away from power in Trenton
Hopefully NJ is smart enough to keep this Trump cuck out of Trenton.
##Just a reminder:  
  
Murphy was only [84,264 votes](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/02/1050183040/new-jersey-governor-election-results-murphy-ciattarelli) away from losing.  
  
And of course, we've had Republican governors before. It's entirely possible for NJ to have a Republican governor. And unfortunately, it seems that any governor can go critical just as DeSantis and Sarah Hackabee Sanders have done.  
  
Any internal New Jersey folk that wanted to see a wrecking ball to NJ (Yes, they do exist) has just become empowered.
Living in south jersey and seeing how much support Trump gets in these parts, this frightens me
These assholes worry me.  NJ has way more maggots than you might think.  Democrats need to really work hard to keep these monsters out of office here.  We could very well lose all the best of NJ if they win.
Met the guy a couple years ago and got the ick factor immediately
GOP will be attacking every blue state because they ultimately want a Constitutional Convention to rewrite the rules‚Ä¶even though apparently there very few consequences to breaking laws as is. 

They need 34 (66%) states to call the convention and 38 (75%) to ratify amendments to The Constitution.
Do your magic, sinkholes
r/stevenfulop
The dumbest boomers you know want DOGE for NJ and what they mean is they want to drive the state into the ground. Pharma, science, tech, and professional services around specialty manufacturing are our biggest industries. Musk is dismantling the basis for all of that. It would be a disaster for us to have that being pushed from Trenton too.

Seriously it will wreck our economy. Do you have any idea what it would mean if pharma left the state? Rust belt on the coast. I lived in CT when GE closed up shop. The cascade and fallout took down suppliers and other companies. It took out small businesses. People lost jobs and moved. People who would have moved there went somewhere else. That‚Äôs what DOGE would do to Nj. We‚Äôd be better off independent or with Canada if this is the future.
Keep both of them out of NJ
Is this the guy that spoke at a January 6 rally? Insurrectionist
Shitarelli
Remember that the Primary election is on June 10th. THAT is the time to be picky about the Democrat on the ballot. When it comes to the November election, vote for the Democrat of Jack Chitarelli will screw up Jersey as much as possible to please Daddy Trumpy! No protesting by not voting.
We need to make sure this state stays Blue... if not, we are screwed¬†
Legit wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they win. Musk and Co. are gonna pour a ton of money into winning the state and I think the state Democratic Party is gonna get caught off guard, especially if the nominee is a moderate like Sherill, Gottheimer, or Sweeney (I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if these three pull a Van Drew flip if they win, at least two of them took Musk‚Äôs PAC money). Some activist known for just getting people to register and vote Republican recently visited my town (which is 50/50 between both parties) and he‚Äôs planning on going all out along with others to flip the state. It‚Äôs gonna be downright ugly in the next few months with the primary and then again this Fall

Well, there‚Äôs an easy voting decision: No way.

Never vote Republican in any election ever!
The fix is in.  No way this will be a ‚Äòfair‚Äô election, sad to say
Just bait your least favorite local republicans into committing state crimes so they can't vote this year ;)
Too bad they didn't fall in a sinkhole
Here comes Elon's money trying to influence NJ elections.
Machine politics has caused all of this too.
Never trust someone who defends Hitler more than modern Americans who refuse to obey conservatives 

Musk even said civil war was coming cause he hates non-conservatives that much (that he daydreams of people attacking and shooting them)
I met this guy once. He showed up at a memorial for a friend who had died of cancer, that was being held at her favorite bar. He asked where she was because he'd like to meet her. One of his handlers tipped him off to the error and he quickly transitioned to stump talk.
Great so this race will also be fixed
They probably discussed how musk will fix the election.
Well, Musk bought the presidency. He‚Äôs gonna buy the next NJ governor.
Jesus fuck. I was born in Texas and have spent half my life here in NJ and I‚Äôve been so happy that I don‚Äôt have to worry about dumb shit here because it‚Äôs stable and not interested with Trump or stupid ass right wing bullshit (except parts of south jersey and ocean county). But this is worrisome. We have to get out and vote!
Can‚Äôt wait to fucking vote.
They hacked the election in 2020 so they are giving him marching orders as they will hack the election and get him into office. My condolences NJ. No blue states and they mean it. Vote just in case I‚Äôm wrong.
I didn‚Äôt read the article but I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs gottheimer right? He‚Äôs about to be van drew 2.0.  May as well just call him the gop/aipac candidate for NJ governor.

I got a bad feeling he‚Äôs going to win.
Of course.
Only if we vote
The bastard couldn't even beat Murphy, even though people hated Murphy at the time (I know because I worked that election)
He almost won last time which is concerning.
New Jersey citizens are reaching their pinnacle of being fed up That's the problem. We got used to paying high taxes but it just keeps getting worse with no relief and sight. 

When times are good people are like okay but I get a lot for that. 

But it's not just taxes groceries are at an all-time high electric is ridiculously high and it's going to get more expensive in June gas is expensive as in gas for your home. 

Home goods are expensive hiring a contractor is expensive buying anything is expensive.

Taxes never ever go down under a Republican either but fucking Murphy with his infamous tagline if you don't like paying high taxes move to another state worries me to no end that they're going to pull that out. 

He's a fucking asshole for being a cocky douchebag and saying that. 

Not to mention I'm worried that no matter what with starlink and Musk running everything no matter who we vote for somehow the fucking douchebag Republican will win. 

Worried is an understatement.
It was actually surprisingly atypical for a Democrat to win reelection in NJ. Hadn‚Äôt happened in decades before Murphy
That was mostly due to the pandemic though. It‚Äôs still good to be adamant, but gotta take that into consideration
We had to drive through Salem and some other Southern towns a few weeks ago. 

The poverty down there was mind-blowing houses look like they were going to blow over in the wind with huge trump flag still flying in their front yard. 

He really leaned in on finding the ignorant.
In Ocean and Monmouth, the flags are slowly coming down. People are embarrassed. That doesn't mean they won't vote for him or Republican again, but they at least don't want people to know they are garbage.
I‚Äôm in west Milford way up north and it‚Äôs maddening how much the idiots around me worship him. I‚Äôm going insane
Yes! I m surrounded by MAGAs
>They need 34 (66%) states to call the convention


Technically 66.7...because 66 would mean only 33 states. But you bring up an interesting point. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution were done by a Constitutional Convention, they were all done by a 2/3 vote in the House and Senate. Because getting 34 States is a really high bar. But the Project 2025 folks are pure evil, so it would make sense that they would try this.
Surprised he didn‚Äôt take the 20 minute drive to Wharton for a photo op.
Please stop with ‚Äúthe boomer‚Äù shit.  These maggots include a lot of young white men and women, Jesus freaks, racists, stupid poor people of all ages.
That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs pronounced, correct?
I disagree. Murphy won on a progressive front. Sherrill could win, most her districts voted Trump
Sherill and Gottheimer both received money from Musk. Not sure about Sweeney.¬†¬†
If the Dems don't take this seriously, it's going to be bad... we need to make sure this state stays blue¬†
Ok calm down.

For the downvoters. Sitting and typing ‚Äúthe fix is in‚Äù is not a productive way to ensure NJ has a valid, free and fair election. It‚Äôs some BS excuse to yourselves and like thinkers to not volunteer, or donate, or campaign yourselves in your local election. Go do something about it.
I hate how Gottheimer is the only one I constantly see ads for. Is it an algorithm thing or am I just unlucky
More like Jack can eat Shittarelli
Hopefully if Trump keeps actively making everything worse, it'll hurt the chances of anyone who publicly sucks his mushroom.
I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be close. Not in his favor, either. This is our time to push back. If we want any change in this country, we must start in our own backyard. This is the pushback we have to give them and if anybody is taking this situation seriously, jack doesn‚Äôt stand a chance IMO
Musk is fixing the voting machines.

Here‚Äôs a silver lining I‚Äôve noticed: MAGA literally doesn‚Äôt vote in non-presidential elections.

It seems Trump reigned in all the Republicans on every level. Ironically, he's an excellent unifier. For the wrong reasons and the worse base.
Murphy also had to work against NJs historical trend of voting for a governor in the party opposite of the the last president to win. 

Last Democrat before Murphy to get re-Elected was Byrne in 1977.

Last time NJ elected a governor from the same party as the president that was just elected was Kean in 1985.

From 1989 to 2017, NJ elected governors from the party opposite of the party that won the presidency the year before.
There's a road in my neighborhood where at least 5 houses with trump flags came down. Still 2 idiots with them up but it's progress I guess.

I almost typed 66.66%‚Ä¶should have just stuck with 2/3.
Sure but here in Ocean County we got massive neighborhoods of old people with their Trump flags proudly displayed outside. A lot of them won't make it to the next election but fuck us I guess.
Amen. A lot of young people voted for trump. Boomer attitudes are disgusting but young people seem to be picking up the torch.
Its really Gen X now that vote disproportional for Trump.
You know you‚Äôre right and I shouldn‚Äôt have said that
I am pretty sure it is! We definitely shouted it at him at the St Patrick‚Äôs parade.
Murphy was a Goldman Sachs executive. He was not seen as a progressive candidate when he was first running for governor.

I have seen no evidence that Trump voters will vote for Sherrill. That actually sounds extremely delusional to me. Democrats need to get out their base, not waste time trying to win over right wingers who are very unlikely to vote for them.
Yes, bc she's a repugnant in disguise! Ras is our only chance
Which districts?
This state will always be blue!
Nah. I think you need to start worrying right away. The discrepancies in other elections prove they aren‚Äôt above cheating.
You obviously haven't watched this. 

The fix most definitely will be happening.

I hope you are right, but Reddit definitely leans left, so the discourse here is not necessarily going to be indicative of the rest of the population. We need the candidates to get out there and talk to people. The more town halls and other appearances the better. They need to speak to people about the issues and allay their fears.
make sure you vote.

there are two things new jersey has a lot of, it‚Äôs voters that hate how much tax we pay to support aid programs for the underprivliged and voters who are elderly.  both groups are ripe fruit when it comes to gop messaging.
That is why I vote by mail with a paper ballot

- West Cadwell
- Florham Park
- Rockaway Township

- Woodland Park
Sure yeah they‚Äôll probably try. But what? Are we trying to discourage people from voting because of it? If we hand it to the Republicans anyway, then what‚Äôs the point of anything?
This. Also, mango Mussolini said himself ‚Äòyou won‚Äôt need to vote‚Äô after this past election.  It was close last time but Murphy pulled it out‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs it going to go with Elons finger on the scale?
You make a great point. In fact, I thought the election would overwhelmingly be in Kamala‚Äôs favor and was proven way wrong. We need to do our part as citizens also. Thanks for the reality check
You mean the team that tried to cheat and fraud their way in to office in 2020 and learned from their mistakes with the world watching while they got off scott free without hard jail time, who then teamed up with backing of tech bro billionaires who have access to all the cutting edge computer tech and ‚Äúknow the voting machines so well‚Äù, and also known to have the backing of foreign actors / nations that have also rigged elections, but this time was running now to escape real jail time - are you saying they would actually try again to cheat do it with a plan where they learned from their mistakes and it was so foolproof that they began flaunting in it slip ups and statements?! And actually do so where every swing state was won just outside the margin of error for automatic recount and yet neither candidate crossed 50% of the votes and both were within a single percentage point of each other? I mean I‚Äôm not a math guy but that seems highly unlikely. So it probably is nothing to worry about, especially the NJ 2025 elections ;)
I think Putin helped but maybe musk was involved?  Not sure but that nonprofit looking into it says the 2020 election appears to have been tampered with as well, just not enough to be successful with all the mail in ballots due to Covid.

He repeated it multiple times. 

Media was like Oh well. 

People were like he doesn't know what he's talking about. 

Oh he sure as fuck did. 
His little secret was starlink Elon Musk and all the tech billionaires who told him don't worry.
I pretty much assumed Trump cheated in 2020. Every accusation Trump has thrown at others has been a confession. Yet I‚Äôm supposed to believe the biggest accusation he made for four years was the one time it was not a confession? Yeah, I don‚Äôt think so. In my opinion Trump was convinced Biden cheated specifically because Trump cheated himself and couldn‚Äôt believe he still lost. So as far as Trump was concerned, it meant Biden also cheated and just did a better job at it instead of their cheating plan just didn‚Äôt take into account so many mail in votes.
The way he was acting the days before the election He looked like he was going to cry. Tired dejected He looked like a loser. He fucking was losing... until Elon Musk the day of the election assured him the Calvary is here. 

I just watched this video yesterday and it fucked me up royally.

I'm sorry I have no hope that we can ever win another election.

MVC registration audit fee?,"My folks use a 2001 jeep wrangler on their chicken farm. They bought it new all those years ago. My dad said I can have it when he passes. It‚Äôs in pretty good shape at 146,000 miles. He doesn‚Äôt drive it off the farm hardly ever but he keeps it registered and insured. I was at his farm last weekend and I used it to hall some stuff around for him. While snooping around the glove box I found out that hasn‚Äôt been registered since 2022 its still insured. After Covid, they stopped leaving the farm too much and I‚Äôm sure they just forgot. They are in their 70s.

Anyway I thought I would do something nice and bring their paperwork up-to-date. I happen to know a DMV where there‚Äôs almost never a wait (or at least a very short wait) and the staff are very nice and things tend to move very fast. So I went to my super secret MVC and they told me I had to pay all of the registration fees from the last time it was registered almost $300 in audit and registration fees 

Now, I don‚Äôt wanna circumvent the law but I also don‚Äôt wanna pay any extra fees for a vehicle that wasn‚Äôt registered anyways. And I certainly don‚Äôt wanna get in trouble over $220.

But. 

If I re-title the vehicle in my name and then register and insure it in my name now can I avoid that audit fee without getting in trouble?

Moving to Belle mead,Is Belle Mead a nice area to live in? For a young family with little kids? I see some private school options in Princeton but definitely nervous for the area bc a lot of it looks undeveloped. Scared to see townhouses pop up in the empty lot near the home we are interested in. Seems like the norm in New Jersey right now just development after another. ,0.13,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jhit5a/moving_to_belle_mead/,31,1jhit5a,2025-03-22 21:11,"Central Jersey is beautiful, Belle Mead included.  Schools are very good, low crime rate, close enough to everything.  There is so much beautiful nature.  It can be a quieter lifestyle, but if you have kids it is a great place to live.  I lived in Hillsborough for 36 years. Raised my children.  It grew from 15000 to 40000 people, but it stayed a very good community.  I never minded the growth.  I just saw it as other folks getting to enjoy the same great community I enjoyed.  If you want open land you do need to buy it. üòä
I live in Belle Mead. It‚Äôs quiet, very good schools. Princeton isn‚Äôt that exciting but good for wandering around as is Somerville. It‚Äôs very much a bedroom community. 

Used to be more rural but several long skated developments are being built. It‚Äôs not a bad thing as a common complaint was always lack of services and restaurants and that‚Äôs improving with more people. Belle Mead now has a great little Asian supermarket and a few restaurants which is a huge improvement as previously you had do drive for anything. 

Just be aware that the schools are highly competitive.
Belle Mead feeds to Montgomery, one of the best school systems in the state. Don't expect any lot to remain undeveloped. If you would like the empty lot near you to remain undeveloped, you are welcome to purchase that empty lot, as well.
I grew up there. It's pretty quiet. They're building more around Montgomery and Hillsborough than Belle Mead. 

The Montgomery school system is solid.
I definitely have some Bergen county ptsd of townhouses and apartment complexes popping up in any spot of open grass lol. So I'm definitely just wondering in that kind of fear of it like buying a house in this more rural area and then next door are townhouses üòÇ
Have you enjoyed living in the area?
Oh I'm not sure if it's for sale it's like a lot of woods area, which attracted us to the town! It seems more urban but I have no idea. Is that kind of the vibe of it? More urban?
Is Montgomery and Belle mead the same school system?
We'd be moving from like the Jersey shore, so it would be a huge jump. I do have a lot of experience with Princeton, but like do people from the area go to Princeton is it kind of like neighboring or considered neighboring?
It‚Äôs fine. A bit quieter than I would like, I have a more urban personality and will eventually move to somewhere walkable. The competitiveness of the school district and the NIMBYs someone else mentioned are the negatives. There‚Äôs a cadre of old residents who constantly complain about newcomers and are really snobbish about anyone who isn‚Äôt wealthy, although the long timers usually aren‚Äôt, they just bought a long time ago. 
If you are new and complain about the lack of street lights, or the poor cell service or the death trap one lane bridge expect to be ripped to shreds. 

I‚Äôd say Somerset County is the unsung gem of NJ though. Enough conveniences without the traffic and mess of the North and without the hick feeling further south. Still midway between Philly and NY and close enough to the shore for a day out.
Urban, no. Growing exurb, yes.
Yes Belle Mead feeds into Montgomery
princeton isn‚Äôt far and my friends from the area frequently go there for nice restaurants, etc. As previously stated, montgomery is an excellent school district. I think there may be enough of a nimby presence regarding the developments, but obviously anything is possible
Living in Belle Mead you neighbor Hillsborough as you're very close to township line road which is the border of Belle Mead/Hillsborough.  And you'd be semi adjacent to Princeton since you still need to drive about 10 mins on 206 to get there or take back roads to around Nassau street.

Ehhh Princeton is pretty boring imo.  Once you've been there a couple times that's about it. And on wkds it gets packed with tourists during the summer and the fall.
Wow this was amazing to hear I feel like I could've written this myself! I definitely have some concerns of the same exact that you're saying. We live in Monmouth County now but I am really familiar with Princeton ish area because my family members went to university there. We are outgrowing our current home and just looking to other places as well even though we love where we currently are there's a ton of new development. 
I feel nervous but maybe it's a bit of growing up in Bergen county ptsd that townhouses and apartments are taking over all of NJ üòÇ
What is the reference to the NIMBYS?
Thank you!
Thank you! Did you find yourself going to Princeton a lot growing up? I have family members who went to the university so we've spent some time there. But besides that like, that's the only really downtown area for fun I can think of.
Thank you so much!
I think I just have Bergen county PTSD with apartments and townhouses popping up in every square mile so I'm definitely wondering it in that kind of sense lol
NIMBY stands for Not in my backyard.

Montgomery used to be a sleepy old rural farm town. So alot of the older residents have pushed back on sprawl and development and would prefer the old status quo.
Montgomery is working on updating and building their downtown where the old VW dealership used to be. They were slated for a bowling alley, Whole foods and several other large anchor stores in that shopping district with some residential homes. 

If you want a more downtown area your options would be Princeton or Somerville.
Worse than that, monmouth county 55+ communities; and all the k hovnanian town houses approaching the 7 figure mark

Can I ask you what is the silvi stone of Belle mead? Someone I know in the area of Hillsboro said it like shakes there home
Thank you!!
Like there's those coming into the area?
It's a quarry by the carrier clinic on Belle Mead Blawenburg road. Never heard or felt anything shake but it depends on how close you are to them I guess
I used to live in Manalapan. when we were house shopping almost every new development in manalapan and surrounding towns in monmouth county were 55+. I barely see those in somerset county
Wow, thank you! It doesn't seem like it's close to Hillsborough
That's a relief! I'm in Monmouth now and it's a joke what's happening to the area. Which is kind of what I'd love to not see moving to Belle mead type area. I know it's inevitable but it's insane when these townhouses are almost a million dollars. 
We can buy a home here as well but it's kind of almost like would it be better to just leave and start somewhere better while the kids are little"

Weird Childhood Memory in Cape May,"Weird Childhood Memory

So this is kind of a strange story, and I wanna preface this with the fact I'm totally aware this could be a false memory. 

So this was somewhere within the realm of ten years ago. For reference, I am 16 now. I'm from PA, but my family has a house that has been in the family for a really long time, and we use it for vacationing down in the Cape May/ wildwood area every summer. When I was very little, im talking like- probably 6-8, my cousin and I were playing in the front yard of the house. It was the late-ish afternoon, maybe 5-7pm. I remember we're playing in the yard, and we notice something is coming down the road. It had one single leg, and connected to that leg was something that looked like a human torso and head. It had no arms or legs, just this metal pole thing. It slid down the road (which is very odd because the road is incredibly weathered and bumpy) and into the woods (the house was on a dead end street). We both looked at each other and confirmed we both has just seen that. We went inside and drew the thing on some graphing paper we found. Eventually I would go on to forget about this memory, kinda telling myself as I got older it was just a made up story my brain internalized. Until one day about 3 years after that event I found the drawing. I had this book growing up that was all about aliens, it's title was something like ""Unexplained Aliens and other phenomenon"" or something. But basically, in the glossary of that book there was a photo of an alien labeled ""One-Legger"" and it matched the drawing and memory pretty well. I still think about it to thus day and how scarily accurate the two pictures were. Basically what I'm asking is if anyone has a similar story or something I'd really love to hear.

Blue Plate Loophole (An Update of Sorts),"Third Edit (intentionally up here): Would be cool if law enforcement or anyone on the inside at MVC commented on this.

As of a few days ago (3/19/25), NJMVC officially approved a request I submitted for a vanity plate for a number that exists on a pair of blue plates (from 1982) I purchased from a collector on eBay.

If you want blue plates for a one-time $50 fee (the assumes you‚Äôre on the registration and not a leasing company, of course):

Step 1: Buy a pair of good-condition blue plates on eBay. Ideally from before 1985 (this is when MVC lost a bunch of registration data and any lapsed numbers from 1985 and earlier about were gone forever so they can now be requested as vanities). Personally, I think the gamble of buying plates first is kinda worth it. 

Step 2: Do the personalized plate form (I did it online so can‚Äôt speak for success with the mail-in) on MVC‚Äôs website with one choice: The plate number you have on the ‚Äúdead‚Äù pre-1985 plates (so basically you can try this with any 1959-1985-issued pair you find). Now of course, the caveat here is the still-present potential to be denied because if the number you bought was renewed past 1985 and then canceled at a later date, it could still be in MVC databases as canceled never to be used again. Point is, you have a good shot of it being approved, and if not you‚Äôre out what you spent on the plates, and you probably don‚Äôt need to worry about the plate number coming up in some cold case crime (this is a little more iffy but if the plate number literally doesn‚Äôt exist in an MVC database, oh well lmao).

Step 3: Wait for new registration (and flat yellow modern plates with that number) to arrive, put blue plates on your car and the new reg in the glove box. Voila. Modern LPR everywhere and cops are only gonna give a shit about the number being legit and matching the car. 

Now, of course they can always get wise to this somehow, but I feel like it isn‚Äôt a big priority for the MVC. I learned this from dated info elsewhere so I feel like it‚Äôs time to give the search engines a freshie update.

Edit (Plate Nerd Shit): I like the [###-AlphaAlphaAlpha] plates so I got that. I feel like passenger plates began with a number for only a short period of time.

Another Edit: I‚Äôm a plate geek and am just as angry about fake plates on the road as all of you, lol. For me, if the state wants to fix this loophole, they very simply just need to do a forced reissue for every number before a certain year and ban all prior-issued combinations from ANY year for vanities. Literally other states do this all the time.",0.67,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jhh4br/blue_plate_loophole_an_update_of_sorts/,13,1jhh4br,2025-03-22 19:55,"ahhh god this thread again.

The blue plates are still not good. They are not what DMV authorized you to put on the car.

Will someone catch you on it, PROBABLY not, same as if you went out and made your own plate that was blue and looked right, but with all of the attention right now on bogus plates why would you want to bring added scrutiny on yourself?

edit: oh and don't be so sure with the plate readers. There are already things out there that will crosscheck the registration, and then return if the car doesn't match what model\etc isn't on file. Wouldn't be much to assume that it is also smart enough to go, ""Hey, that isn't a plate issued in 2025 on it"". Its trivial technology to do these days.
Fellow plate nerd and knower of knower of motor vehicle laws here. Not legal. You PROBABLY won‚Äôt run into any issues or could at least explain your way down to a simple ticket but this isn‚Äôt above board. It‚Äôs the same as the white on black plate thing you‚Äôre describing in the eyes of the law (just historically interesting versus douche).

I think it‚Äôd be cool if the MVC allowed for something like this as you‚Äôre not doing anything nefarious and the numbers match. Could you be stopped and cited for this? Yes. Do most agencies in the state have bigger fish to fry? Also yes.
I just don't get why there has never been an initiative to do a reboot in the similar style? New York's had 3 different variants in 20 some odd years.  They got all the special interest vanity plates for NJ but they don't  think people would want a throw back?
Love this thank you!
I feel like LPR would alert to *every* single car that had plates transferred to a new car by its owner, in that case. The blue plates are certainly pushing it, but I see pre-2014 embossed plates on 2020-later cars pretty often still, and honestly Jersey‚Äôs laws enable even more combos than that - my mom runs a flat plate originally issued in 2016 on a 2022 model after she did a plate transfer.

With all of this said, eh, we‚Äôre gonna bend the rules and bend them for a bit, under the auspices of all the stupid shit out there people do to deface/conceal their plates, or running fake shit entirely, and seemingly never having issues.
I am sorry, lol.

If this gets shut down I do get it.

If it became an issue, I‚Äôll throw the yellow ones on and figure something out.

Edit: I drive around with a small New Jersey sticker my wife made on her Cricut to the correct dimensions from the baseplate in a space on my NJ Devils vanities and have *never* had an issue or been pulled over. Very not-how-it-was-issued and NJ separator on vanities isn‚Äôt allowed. Idk.
Yeah, the correct plates will stay in the car. Wild how MVC leaves this wide open, lol.

I figure that this is something we can roll the dice with for fun for a year or so and just see what happens. So many people do actually worse things like the TikTok plates, smoked covers, no front plate, damage/peeling rendering illegibility, frames that cover ‚ÄúNew Jersey‚Äù entirely, etc. and seem to never get pulled over.
I want to be clear that the very first comment *does* make a valid point that there‚Äôs risk to this: I‚Äôm of the mindset that as long as your number matches the car, since LPR is pretty ubiquitous now even inside cop cars, you‚Äôre *probably* fine. Now of course, there‚Äôs been a recent trend these never-state-issued white-on-black plates with legit numbers, and all the problems with paper tags that have had to been addressed.

For me, the state opened this can of worms when they didn‚Äôt force everyone to get a new flat plate in 2014.
naa pretty straight forwards.

DMV knows when you were issued your plates. So they know what ""model"" of plates you had. Even if you transfer from an old car, pull a pair you had in the basement from a previous car, whatever. 

Yeah, as OP said, once you go back far enough records start getting a bit sketchy, but they certainly know you were issued a yellow plate and not a blue plate. Image recognition stuff is good enough today where they would be pretty good on determining different ""models"" of yellow plates apart as well. Embossed vs non is childsplay for image recognition.

If you have a legal blue plate, that means you have been rocking it continuously for 30 some odd years, so again, you can just follow the paperwork back to ""blue plate"" era.

But its silly to be arguing about the technicalities of it. 

Likely what happens to OP is he gets some extra police attention every time they see the blue plate, and they run it. Like he said it will come back to a valid tag that matches his car, and even if the cops computer shows it was recently issued and should be yellow, i doubt the cop looks that far. 

Where it likely will give him hassle is if he rolls up on a plate enforcement check at a bridge, and someone knowledgeable on plates puts 2 and 2 together. Even then i suspect OP would just get a small fine, if that, and told to fix it. 

But as toll evasion with bogus plates is now a big thing, its only a matter of time until smarter plate readers are common that can identify stuff that looks good on the surface but isn't kosher, both through better image recognition and cross referencing other data sources. Actual money is on the line, so it isn't like departments won't want to invest into better stuff. 

I just never really grasped why people want to stand out so much on the road. I want a nice car that won't get you a second look if you are going a bit over the speed limit. That isn't just screaming ""pull me over"" so if you are driving late on a weekend you pick up a tail who thinks you might be a DUI. So if i accidentally cut off or flip off someone i know, there is at least a little doubt in their mind if it was actually me. 

Blue plate guy is little different than Cybertruck guy.  Its, ""hey, look at me""
Pretty sure other states have a process for utilizing and registering historic plates. Would be cool to see the same here. Probably the worst you‚Äôd get is a ticket. The black and white plate thing is worse bc it‚Äôs technically altering or forging gov documents but I haven‚Äôt heard of anyone actually getting prosecuted for that. The way you went about this is more a blind spot on the MVC‚Äôs side. Good luck!
This is all pretty great. Learning a lot.
Not only that, (I have OCD/ADD so I‚Äôm gonna riff for a moment lmao) in a supreme freak scenario where I‚Äôd be [hypothetically] accused of forging blue plates, I acquired them from a great source on eBay who I actually exchanged correspondence with and it would be easy to have him vouch for me if called as witness in that [unprecedented] case, haha. Like, he‚Äôs literally a card-carrying plate collector in the form of ALPCA membership who has commented in local news for articles about the stalling blue plate revival in Trenton.
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt worry on that front, even straight up fictitious plates basically never get prosecuted past a traffic summons. The blue plates look fresh, I hope they change the laws someday. I have plates from modern day back to WW1 era to pick from. Could def get creative with it."

It is life changing I swear.
I‚Äôve actually tried theirs in highland park - it‚Äôs close but def really oily in comparison.
They definitely have 3/Triple Pepper Chicken
Any reccos on Chinatown spots for a beef roll?

It‚Äôs Szechuan peppercorns. They are not like chili peppers. Instead they numb your tongue instead
Maybe try Lin‚Äôs in Morristown. I‚Äôm not sure what Trevion of Chinese food they specialize in, but I do know they have a special menu if you ask for it."

Immaculata high school money grab,"Curious if anyone else has a kid involved in a sport at Immaculata high school in Somerville ?
My child is CONSTANTLY being asked to basically beg our family and friends for donations.  We are never told with the money is going toward .   If anyone can explain this to
me I would appreciate it .  ",0.31,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jhcooy/immaculata_high_school_money_grab/,9,1jhcooy,2025-03-22 16:43,"Have you asked the school?
Ok so I assume your tuition is a lot. Now look at your tuition and compare that to the per student cost of your local school system. I would bet your tuition is significantly less. 

So regardless of whether their fundraising needs to be more straightforward almost all catholic schools are struggling even in the suburbs. 

Where I grew up in solid middle to upper class suburbs  they closed the majority of the elementary and middle schools.
Why would someone down vote me for asking for help in explaining this to me ?  Anyway , one of the moms did ask the coach what the money went to and he could not offer her a solid explanation‚Ä¶.and guess what ? her child went from starting most games to sitting the bench about 70% of the time .
Probably because they have a smaller budget. My kids went to public school and there were always plenty of fund raisers. Quite annoying. Anyway, here is what AI has to say about public school vs. Catholic school budgets.

Public schools generally have larger budgets than Catholic schools in the United States, primarily due to differences in funding sources and scale. Public schools are funded through a combination of federal, state, and local government revenues, mostly from taxes, which provide substantial financial support. In contrast, Catholic schools, as private institutions, rely heavily on tuition, parish contributions, fundraising, and sometimes limited government assistance (e.g., for transportation or textbooks in certain states), resulting in smaller overall budgets.

For example, in the 2020‚Äì21 school year, U.S. public elementary and secondary schools spent an average of $18,614 per pupil, with total expenditures reaching $927 billion for roughly 49.8 million students. This funding comes from federal (13.6%), state (43.7%), and local (42.7%) sources, equating to approximately $857 billion in current spending for K-12 education in 2022. Per-pupil spending varies by state but often exceeds $15,000 annually, with high-spending states like New York reaching $29,873 per pupil in 2022.

Catholic schools, however, operate on much leaner budgets. In the 2016‚Äì17 school year, the average cost to educate a student in a parish elementary Catholic school was $5,887, with tuition covering about $4,400 (74.7%) of that amount, and the rest subsidized by parishes or fundraising. For Catholic high schools, the average cost was $13,939, with tuition at $9,840 (70.6%). With nearly 2 million students enrolled in Catholic schools nationwide, their total budgets are significantly lower‚Äîestimated at roughly $11.8 billion annually (based on per-pupil costs)‚Äîcompared to public school totals. Catholic schools also tend to have lower per-pupil expenditures due to factors like lower teacher salaries and fewer administrative costs.

The disparity stems from public schools‚Äô access to tax revenue and their obligation to serve all students, leading to larger enrollments and infrastructure needs. Catholic schools, serving a smaller, self-selected population (about 5% of U.S. K-12 students), operate with more constrained resources. However, budget size doesn‚Äôt directly reflect educational quality‚ÄîCatholic schools often achieve strong academic outcomes despite spending less per student, a point frequently highlighted in education debates.

So, while public schools have larger total budgets and typically higher per-pupil spending, Catholic schools manage with less, relying on private funding and efficiency. Exact comparisons depend on specific districts and regions, but the structural funding differences consistently give public schools a financial edge in scale.
A parent did ask and no one could give her a solid reason , just a lot of talking in circles .
Somerville per pupil spending is $21,914 annually.


According to their website, Immaculata costs almost exactly $20k all in ($19,050 plus various fees for underclassmen).


Those two numbers are much closer than I expected
I think you should ask.
Yeah that is much closer then I expected. But is that specific to the high school? Or for all grade levels?

Because high school is usually higher.
You're correct, these are the high school numbers. That's what I saw on the website but don't check if they also have a middle or elementary school"

When and why did the Turnpike stop putting exit numbers on the signs at the northbound Western/Eastern Spur split?,The signs should indicate that you can‚Äôt reach 15E or 15X from the northbound western spur.,0.89,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jhbkq0/when_and_why_did_the_turnpike_stop_putting_exit/,44,1jhbkq0,2025-03-22 15:54,"Fuck the stretch of highway between the airport and here. Nothing like picking up your tired traveled family only to hit 2-3 wrong turns adding 30 minutes to your ride home of hell.¬†
Because those aren't exits, just different highways.
I take this road all the time and i still havent figured it out. I could open up google maps and study it but meh
I have no idea why they took these off. It's not intuitive to people from out of state. If you want to go to Clifton or Rutherford, you have to go to the George Washington Bridge side.
when they replaced the old barrel signs with these ones with the led boards. and it made life easier for them because sometimes things close in weird ways. eventually that blank part on the left sign for the lincoln tunnel will say interstate 695. they want to renumber the eastern spur as 695 instead of having the weird ""they're both 95"" thing even though both spurs lead back to 95 in ridgefield.
When NJTA updated all the Turnpike and Parkway signs to be compliant with the federal MUTCD. According to MUTCD, navigation signs must reference one of:

* Up to 3 highway shields and/or up to 2 place names
* 1 or 2 non-highway-sheld street names, often used in urban areas where the connecting road does not connect to any other places or roads with a highway shield.
* The non-highway-shield legend must appear in title case, as it is easier to read than all-uppercase. The various banners that go with highway shields, however, remain in small caps, including cardinal directions.
* Non-highway-shield street names cannot be combined with place names, to avoid confusion.
* Cannot mix lettered and non-lettered exits with the same exit number when exit numbers correspond with mile markers. A bunch of exits on the Parkway had to be renumbered because of this. The Turnpike may be exempt from this rule though, since it still uses sequential exit numbers regardless of mile marker.

With the mixing bowls in both directions, it appears that NJTA decided that emphasizing connecting highways and place names is more relevant than exit numbers, which could potentially be changing on the Turnpike since they are still the deprecated sequential style.

One of the Turnpike spurs may also have to get renumbered, likely to I-695, also for MUTCD compliance. A lot of this is because the Turnpike was designed and built way before there was a nationally uniform Interstate highway system.
Because Google got tired of saying, ""In a quarter mile, take 15E 15X 16E 18E I-80 Route 46 Lincoln Tunnel"". Plus, that's confusing as hell for an out of towner to hear and process quickly enough to make the right decision.
It was back during the drone invasion the authorities thought it was aliens and they didn‚Äôt want to give the Martians good direction‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..LOL
It also told which way was meadowlands
lefty westy righty easty
It's been several months at least.
Just spitballing, one of the spurs is gonna be renumbered to 895 in the future, so maybe with that it's gonna bring new exit numbers, and they didn't wanna make new signs with exit numbers just to be useless in a few years. There should be something saying western spur and eastern spur maybe above the arrows tho for the time being
Anyone saying it's easier to memorize, just so you're aware there's been construction on both exit ramps at random times (usually during and after rush hour) making it sound you have to do an entire loop . Even worse Google doesn't mark it and doesn't know how to get around it. I live locally and grew up with this split and it still confuses the hell out of me.
Welcome to the Garden State!!!!!!
I've been living in NJ for over 20 years and panic every time at that split
I just wish they would officially call them Eastern and Western spur, as we refer to them. It‚Äôs so confusing. Both go to the GW bridge. Both can lead to 80. They‚Äôre both 95.
God this annoys me so much. Even going southbound it makes zero sense.
It's been a few months.
This is the worst when using google maps. Highly recommend using Apple Maps to avoid confusion
The signs are obvious. If you know what highway you need, it‚Äôs easy.  People get confused when they use GPS.
It's almost like the two spurs need different names..........
Yeah but if you want to take exit 15E or 15X you can't take it from both splits. Every time I come to this area I have to frantically try to remember which way to go, or pull up Google maps real quick.

It's a shit design.
Yes
I just follow the GPS and somehow I get to work taking either side
The trick I use is W exits - > go to ""W""ashington side.
*this* explains why one spur got the turnpike shield only and the other one got turnpike/95 on the new signs!!! and honestly, i‚Äôd welcome this change!
> that blank part

Or they just swap the I-95 designation for traffic control reasons: https://imgur.com/a/B3NqfBl
AASHTO assigns numbers, not USDOT/MUTCD
Well, that‚Äôs Google‚Äôs problem.

Or if NJ wants to help out Google, have giant ‚ÄúEastern Spur‚Äù and ‚ÄúWestern Spur‚Äù signs on top.
Part of me hates how hard I actually lol to this comment
the proposal is to number it as 695 eventually. it's a number that new jersey has but never used. it was supposed to be on part of the never built somerset freeway that would have gone between piscataway township and hopewell, there was going to be a short spur to connect to 287 northbound in franklin twp.
That would make sense. The spurs, and extension is confusing for people who don‚Äôt know.
When they built the turnpike, I guess they never imagined adding more exits, so they just went 1, 2, 3...  instead of by mile marker like most highways.

They should really change to this method to avoid needing to add letters to the end.

https://www.maikoff.net/njt.html
Okay, I need rt 3. It used to say it!
So you're saying the signs are obvious if you know where you're going? Then why have signs at all? Signs are for people that don't know where they are going.
Or take a nice big scenic route around the mci center and race track.
I am in the same boat as you are.  It is fucked up design.
Isn't the Eastern exits....east?
Which spur got which?
The old signs were super confusing to people that didn't travel that route regularly because there were so many exits listed on the signs. I'm all for them using the digital signs to try to find a better solution.
You can hit 3 from both spurs - the eastern spur just brings you a little roundabout way to it.
If you want to take 15E or 15X you have to take the route towards the Lincoln Tunnel which is the spur that is on the western side.

The sign is also confusing because both spurs are 95N and both go to 80 W
West is 95/TP, East is TP only (Future 695), which kinda makes sense to me. I feel like the logic here is 95 is for people passing thru NJ/NY entirely, 695 for people ultimately leaving the 95 corridor to get *into* Newark/JC/NYC (hence the control destination being ‚ÄúLincoln Tunnel‚Äù on that side), not ultimately proceeding north towards NYS/NE.
Yes, I can hit the parkway also from both spurs too. 

The point being is, one would show meadowlands and the other would show Secaucus"

Forget about the laws. The short answer is, think of it as a stupid test. Weed has always been that when it comes to drug tests (outside of stuff like DOT and the like)

You know you are looking for a job, you know they are testing for drugs, you know if you lay off weed for a couple of weeks, you won't have any problems.

Now if you piss blazing hot for weed on that test, can they deny you employment over that? maybe sort of possibly no if you really push it and they cite that as a reason. Good luck though, you can now try and lawsuit yourself into a job that will hate you because you caused them a bunch of problems, and have to do it without a lot of established case law on it.

Will they look at you differently as a candidate because ""hey this dude knew he was going to have to pee in a cup, but still came in blazing hot, looks like he doesn't know when to lay off the weed""........possibly.
Yes
Do you have any explanation to this answer or did you just blindly say yes
NJ law states that it is unlawful to discriminate against someone in hiring or employment on the basis of their use (or non-use) of cannabis. This is part of the same law that legalized cannabis in the state.

Apparently, she moved out of NJ in the 70s.  Apparently, she and Maury raised their son in Middletown.  Apparently, they only had a *summer* home in Middletown while living in NYC.  Apparently, she has not lived in NJ for a long time, and she and Maury split their time between New York, Florida, and Montana.  I don't know what's true and what's not.

But any which way, nobody thinks ""Connie Chung"" and ""New Jersey"" or ""New Jersey Trivia"" or ""People from New Jersey"".  And sure as fuck not Bloomfield.  Or Middletown, for that matter, except for maybe a handful of Middletown residents who were around when she supposedly lived there. 

And as a journalist, she is widely know for national news, and maybe NYC news.  Nothing NJ specific.  I don't understand how she is NJ.

Also, she was a douchebag on her episode of WTF with Maron recently.  

If you wanna name a rest stop /service area in Bloomfield, NJ after a journalist / TV anchor, name it after Steve Adubato.  He is NJ, and NJ TV, through and through.  A big Rutgers guy.  He got his master's and doctoral degrees in communications from Rutgers.  And post Rutgers, has professored at Rutgers, Seton Hall, Rowan, NJIT, Caldwell University and Montclair State.  He also lives in Montclair, which is Bloomfield adjacent.  Connie Chung graduated from U. of Maryland, and taught at Harvard.

The Steve Adubato service are should be named the Adubato Auto Area.
One should be named for Danny DeVito. Idc which one.
Connie Chung should be renamed to Floyd Vivino. Uncle Floyd is *much* more NJ than Connie Chung.

Sure, but try smaller mom and pop 2nd floor apartments. They are usually cheaper, but with less amenities.

I see good options in Boonton, Morristown, Plainfield, Dunellen, Highland Park, Perth Amboy, Rahway, South Orange, West Orange, Bloomfield.
Look at local listings with families renting out their second apartment. It's definitely do-able if you aren't looking to be in a big apartment complex.

Yes in Englewood. But it's not a luxury apt. It'll probably be a 2nd fl apt
Depends on where in NJ. If literally anywhere is fine,  yes absolutely there‚Äôre a good amount of options in south Jersey.

North East NJ would be harder but you probably can still find something by looking hard enough through both online listings and local postings
Depends on the part of the state you‚Äôre looking

Try Hotpads, Apartments.com, and Zillow. They have different locations available, sometimes. Also note that North NJ, you get much less bang for your buck compared to South.

1. Research some moderate-income neighborhoods that do not have high violent crime rates. They're not as common as so-called ""bad"" neighborhoods, but they do exist. They are typically urban neighborhoods, but for a newly single person prioritizing lower rent costs, that should not be a problem.

2. Visit some of these places in person and see if any places have ""for rent"" signs with direct numbers for the landlord to call. Alternatively, you can stop into some of the neighborhoods' local social spots - think deli bodegas, coffee shops, diners/luncheonettes, etc. - and ask around if anyone knows if anything is available by word of mouth, so to speak. Such places are often priced lower than places marketed to ultra-wide audiences on various commercial Internet resources.  A local agent - either a real estate or apartment broker may be able to help, at least with the listing, but the latter may cost you a broker fee, which the searching tenant usually pays.

I have a fenced in front and backyard, 2 story, two bedroom house in Burlington for $1200
I work in a hospital,  I have a college degree and according to rent calculators,  I could only afford a shitbox in a bad neighborhood.   Not an ideal living situation for an older woman.   It's good that I'm not in that situation. 

The rent is too damn high.
try north village apartments in north brunswick i‚Äôm not quite sure what they go for these days but it‚Äôs a nice complex. not luxury by any means but very spacious and have washer dryer in unit
My old 1bd in bogota (Bergen county) was $1475. 900 sq ft. Moved out in October 2024.
North or south Jersey?
Good luck.
No.
Yes in journal square
1BR in Nutley are around 1750 and they‚Äôre in pretty good areas, not too much over your budget, I‚Äôve been in Nutley 15 years and love it here
I mean the budget is low so it may be hard but it prob would take less time to just download a real estate app and look it up. If I had to guess I'd say no though but can't speak for the ENTIRE state.¬†
No.
I recommend getting a realtor. They have a lot of knowledge in that department. They also can work out deals for you.
There‚Äôs this apartment complex on Center Ave Fort Lee, NJ, but it‚Äôs got roaches and disrespectful neighbors, and you gotta avoid first floors because stupid people put in things that they shouldn‚Äôt through toilet and things get clogged and you‚Äôll see shit bubbling up and backing up through your toilet and bathtub. (Personal experience lmao never again. Then my gf and I woke up at 5AM in cold winter morning and started collecting what was backing up with a 1 gallon bucket outside because shit was backing up from bathtub and toilet.)

Forget commercial online resources. They're all marketed to too wide an audience, and you'll get ripped off, even if you do find something below $1600.

Your best bet is to research target neighborhoods and go old-school hitting the pavement, looking for ""for rent"" signs with phone numbers, and talking to people in person in local social spots.

And yes, at the price, it is likely going to be a 2nd-floor apartment in an old house if you're looking in the more urban parts of the state, but that's what $1600/month gets you there when you're competing against dual-income residents that can easily go well over $2000/month or more.
What goes on down there? It looks cute!  But do you guys just go to Philly, or‚Ä¶?

It‚Äôs almost like affordable housing is a pressing issue in the state/country.
North nj. Right around the GWB. There are some private homes that or smaller 2 lvl Apts in that neighborhood that is reasonable with rent
What part you recommend with reasonable rent , in Englewood
I‚Äôm still pretty new, but there‚Äôs a few bars, the downtown is nice and the waterfront has a lot of events, food truck fair every Wednesday during the summer, philly is close, there‚Äôs a lot of outside stuff, we‚Äôre pretty close to six flags and beaches and Trenton transit center makes New York trips pretty convenient, and there‚Äôs the river line here so for 3 bucks round trip you can even start the trip from downtown Burlington. 

Bordentown is 10 minutes away and chickies and Pete‚Äôs is fire and thats a 295 and 95 exchange so getting pretty much everywhere is fairly convenient

4th ward is probably your best bet. They have a lot of private 2 family homes, smaller apartments. Downtown englewood is mostly luxury apartments now but off the side streets still have a number of 3 family homes. I see for rent signs sometimes.

"I'm probably the only one who cares about it, but the Mulch sale is now going on at HD\Lowes.

Quality varies by location, from shredded construction debris in a bag, to top notch wood chips.

If the bags ripped they‚Äôll sell it for half price
Info: what constitutes good mulch?
I usually call the local nurseries/ bulk mulch delivery places - their prices vary daily but the best I‚Äôve gotten 5cy delivered for about the same price as the $2/bag HD/Lowe‚Äôs at a much better and more consistent quality and it typically lasts 4/5 seasons without the color completely bleaching out. At seasons 4 and 5 I get 10-15 bags and just do a light color touch up where needed.
I been watching prices and I don‚Äôt see the sale yet. I only see 1.5 cu. ft. for $2.50. I was waiting for the 2 cu. ft. bags to go on sale.
yeah ours does, and its good quality stuff, but it isn't very consistent (its the stuff they collect during yard waste pickup run through the chipper\shredder a couple of times).

Great if you want actual mulch properties for keeping moisture in your beds and stuff like that, but a bit too fine for looks, like your front yard around some trees or whatever where you can't get grass to grow or want to keep weeds out to dress it up.
No body parts.
Free of crap. A lot of times these its recycled construction\old pallets\yard waste that they just keep on shredding until its not noticeable. They source this stuff locally, so every store, and every batch can be different in quality depending on where and when they got it.

A garden center will usually charge about 50 bucks a yard (about 15 bags), and then maybe another 50 bucks delivered for decent mulch. But most require 3 or 4 yards minimum for delivery, so it can be a bit overkill. Many towns will offer it for free\cheap, but its more for doing actual mulching stuff, than aesthetics.

I like to just go every year and rent their truck and buy a pallet of the stuff to redress our existing mulch beds. Its usually the perfect amount, and saves a step when its bagged vs having to wheelbarrow a big pile of it around the yard. Plus if you have any extra, its easy to get rid of bags of it, than asking people to come shovel it out of your driveway.

But its also a bit of preference and what you are using it for. Sometimes you want stuff super shredded, sometimes you want large chips for the aesthetics. The lowes in paramus had some decent stuff, but it was more shredded than i would like for where i need it.

The key thing is nobody wants shredded garbage, or last years stock that has been sitting around for a year getting moldy (fyi: lowes changed the branding on their cheap bags this year, you want stuff labeled stay-green this year for the ""fresh"" stock).
Yeah the truck is the way to go, I don't need enough to make use of a minimum load for them most years though. Every couple of years i'll do a more thorough job and completely remulch everything, but most years I can get away with a pallet of it and quickly turning stuff over and topdressing.

I do need maybe 5 yards of soil this year so have to start looking around for who has good stuff. The last time i got that from the garden center i got burned and it was more fill than topsoil and introduced all kinds of crap to my yard.

Funny thing was i just found a couple of bags from a few years ago behind my shed while doing some cleanup today i forgot about. I expected them to be completely shot but they were like brand new.
HD has the Scotts 1.5 like you said. Usually those tend to be of higher quality, but like all mulch its hit or miss. Looks like the 1.5 4 for 10 is going to be their deal this year.

Lowes has 2cf Staygreen stuff stacked up to the rafters. Wasn't on sale as of earlier this week by me, but the guy said they were going to be 2.50 as well when the sale hit, and that seems consistent with what other regions are saying

The stuff i quickly looked at in lowes though was VERY finely shredded whereas the scotts stuff was mostly good size chips.

Again though, its pretty much the lottery with these things as to who gets the good stuff, even in the same store.
I‚Äôve definitely had some with parts of rubber mixed in and that was incredibly upsetting. I would like to figure out how to identify better much. I know look for mold. Is all black much dyed?
The mold isn't a super deal breaker depending on what you are doing with it. If you keep it on top so the sun hits it, and it dries it out, it will usually look fine after a bit. 

But the rubber and stuff, yeah, its the luck of the draw. Try and find stuff from the same pallet (more likely to be from the same batch) and really look into a bag on it, you know, maybe one that accidentally opened a bit......and when you find one that looks relatively good, grab him and his brothers. But even then its a crapshoot.

Also dry bags, but that is kind of hard to do this time of year when they have a massive amount of overstock in on these sitting outside.

Edit: Yeah most mulches are dyed, even the ""brown"" stuff. just because of the mix of what goes into the bagged stuff. A garden center will usually have a more natural non-dyed brown, likely hickory or cedar, but you will pay twice as much for it. Its the way to go though if you find yourself needing more than 2 or 3 dozen bags, and then the costs quickly become more on par. If you don't care about cost, want good looks and stuff that will hold up a few seasons, good cedar stuff is the way to go for longevity, and arguably questionable natural anti-insecticide\animal repelant properties, but you are looking at probably 75+ bucks a yard if you find it.

Believe there‚Äôs a place called Village Hall in South Orange that would be your beer garden. If you‚Äôre looking more casual but maybe not outdoors Van Goghs Ear in Union has tons of games to play and is a nice setting. Maybe not the best food IMO but Oh Brian‚Äôs Green in Clark has mini golf right outside. Same for McLoons Boathouse in West Orange. You‚Äôre right by mini golf, zoo, lots of outdoor recreational activities. If you pick any restaurant near Broad St. in Westfield after dinner is done you can pop over to Yestercades for tons of nostalgic games. Two Ton Brewing in Kenilworth has outdoor cornhole I believe but I don‚Äôt think they do food. It‚Äôs also in a rather odd spot.

The Dive in Cranford. Call ahead and see if you can get the table by the window. Good luck üçÄüé±üçÄ
That meeting halfway thing makes no sense. Go to around where you are and pick a place you like that you think they will like too, or go to around where they are and have them pick a place the both of you will like. The idea of meeting somewhere neither of you are familiar with in the name of some sense of mathematical fairness is foolish. IF that first date goes well, then the other person can choose to have the second date near them.
River and Rail Cantina in Cranford. They have outside seating and usually corn hole outdoors. Really cool place

One cause of sinkholes for New Jersey is the loss of groundwater from people punping wells to water their lawns.
I don't know, but remember when Mulder & Scully came to Atlantic City to investigate the Jersey Devil, and it turned out to be secret cannibal Neanderthal Pineys? 

Where are Mulder & Scully now, bro???

We got drones (obvious alien activity) and supernatural sinkholes (obvious angry ghosts of old timey miners seeking retribution, and disgusted with the over development of our modern times, and also still hunting for zinc and copper) that need Special Agent FBI investigation.

Also, I have a practical question that I would like to tack on to this post:

As a home owner in Morris County, how worried do I need to be about these sinkholes?  

Up to now, the only thing I have known about sinkholes, is that in Florida, they are unpredictable, violent, angry earth poltergeists that swallow houses whole.  

So far, in NJ, we only see reports about major highways.  (And surprisingly, no cars have driven into one yet.)  But if there are \~600 abandoned mines in the 9 northern counties of NJ...then the sinkholes are everywhere, and not just underneath highways, right?  Looking at some of these maps of all of the abandoned mines, it's not just Wharton or Parsippany.  It's Randolph, Mendham, Chester, Morristown, Rockaway, Dover, Boonton, Kinnelon, etc. etc. and even places like the Oranges and Montclair.

When I'm lying in bed at night, grinding my teeth on my mouth guard, having agita about my future retirement prospects, my JCPL bill, property tax bill, constant Summit Health / Atlantic Health billing fuckery, where is my NJ tax refund, do I really need to get a colonoscopy, do I really need to get a Real ID, etc., etc., do I need to also add ""*What if a sinkhole opens underneath me right now, and power-flushes me & my house into the center of the earth, or to the deepest depths of hell?  If I survive, how much will State Farm cover?*"" to my bedtime thoughts?
The one that opened up on 287 yesterday just wanted to add some literal shit to the shitshow that's Parsippany's local politics right now. 

Y'all can find better mayoral candidates than Barberio and Musella, right? Right? They're both pretty terrible.
I said it yesterday, it's the Earth trying to swallow us because we're fucking up up here
Trump found Significant Mineral Resources
Chris Christie fell
Politicians. 

Picatinny employees are significantly impacted by the rt80 sinkholes, every way in the base is severely backed up either directly or due to the detours. This aligns perfectly with the end of remote work and efforts to reduce the federal workforce. 

Also to those who dont know where their taxes go, civilian employee conpensation is only 6% of federal spending.
It's just stage 2 in the alien invasion
CHUDs (cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers) have for years been burrowing unchecked under our highways, causing our highways to finally collapse. The recent swarm of nocturnal drones was an (unsuccessful) attempt to localize and neutralize the CHUDs.
Bob Menendez and his people were removing all of his gold from the mines

Can a Middle-Class Family Thrive in Rumson?,"
We used to live in the Middletown area before we had kids and are now returning with a young family (kids under 5). We‚Äôre debating where to settle down.

Our biggest concern isn‚Äôt just the cost of the house ‚Äî it‚Äôs the social pressure. We‚Äôre worried about being the ‚Äúbroke‚Äù family in a very affluent town. We‚Äôve done our homework, talked to friends, but everyone seems to have a strong opinion ‚Äî and no one actually lives in Rumson. Everyone wants us to live in their town: most push Fair Haven as more grounded, others say Atlantic Highlands or Navesink are friendlier and more our speed.

We‚Äôre prepared to have honest conversations with our kids about money, privilege, and why our life might look different than some of their classmates‚Äô. But we‚Äôre wondering if we‚Äôd just be setting ourselves up for constant low-level stress trying to ‚Äúkeep up‚Äù or fit in.

If you live in any of these towns ‚Äî especially Rumson ‚Äî what‚Äôs been your experience? Is it possible to build a community as a middle-class family in Rumson, or would we likely feel out of place? Would love to hear from people who‚Äôve wrestled with the same decision, whether you jumped in or chose another town.",0.53,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jh2flr/can_a_middleclass_family_thrive_in_rumson/,12,1jh2flr,2025-03-22 06:38,"If you can afford it fine, but if you'll end up house-poor, than reconsider your options.  But do it for you, not because of any social pressure.  If living there will make you broke, or make you feel broke, then yeah consider Fair Haven or Highlands.
We had a choice between Rumson or Middletown.  We decided that we didn‚Äôt want to be the poorest family on the block in Rumson.  Just our 2 cents
possibly post in r/MonmouthCounty \-

As a Lincroft resident, I have friends that live in Rumson and they are clearly middle class living on Hance.
I've heard enough stories of neighbors feeling socially ostracized in Rumson/Fair Haven, who will talk about it privately but never in situations in which it come back around on them.  I think you're wise for considering this before you set your heart on a town.
I have a friend that had to live in Rumson. He bought a house and is raising two kids there. He has an old, smallish, awkward house that he put tons of money into to make it ‚Äúmodern‚Äù (what do you do with a tiny, useless front room in the 21st century?).  He had to petition his neighbors for central air and they said ‚Äúno‚Äù. My SIL also lives in Rumson, in an 8000 square foot house with tennis courts and a pool and I‚Äôve never heard a complaint about Rumson. 

I say, go where you fit in.
Atlantic Highlands. Navesink = Middletown and Rumson = MAGAland.
I guess my question is, why would you want to? It strikes me as odd that you want to live in a community where you feel like you will put your children at a social disadvantage just so you can what, tell other people you live in Rumson? That's a super weird motivation.
ignore what people think. it seems like you guys can afford it so i‚Äôll say go for it
Will cross post thanks. üôè Are they happy. Kids?
That‚Äôs not my motivation at all‚Äîquite the opposite, actually. I‚Äôve already decided there would be might be scenarios where I won‚Äôt even mention living in Rumson and will just say ‚Äúthe Red Bank area‚Äù to avoid any assumptions or judgment.

The real draw for me is the combination of strong schools, access to the ferry, and the walkable, family-friendly vibe. The parks and small neighborhood feel are exactly what we‚Äôre looking for. It‚Äôs really about what‚Äôs best for our kids day-to-day‚Äînot about status.
Yes, kids ride bikes to the school.
As a 25 year FH resident whose wife grew up in the 70s in Rumson when it came time to look for a house we chose Fair Haven for some of the same reasons you mention.  Fast forward 25 years I wish I had chosen Rumson. Much bigger diversity of wealth IMO makes people less likely to think their shit don't stink. FH has a lot less big money so everyone is about the same and alot of wannabes and social pressure is abound (have to go away every school break because that's what everybody does!  Hint..we didn't and as I told my daughter your college is more important than a ski trip). I find Rumson to be a lot less of that and I think the schools are better there.  Feel free to PM me if you want to discuss more."
Electric bill is HIGH,"We are out of ideas as to what is going on. The past three months, our electric bill has been insane.

It‚Äôs been 700$, 650$ and now 450$.

A little background,

We have electric heat, central air, and a 1500 square foot house. We rarely ever have lights on, the heat runs periodically throughout the day at no higher than 68. We average around 66 degrees. 

I‚Äôm truly shocked at how these prices are even possible‚Ä¶.and this is before JCP&L raises their prices June 1st.

Cold weather and electric heat
I feel like everyone in the state has been complaining of electric bills
Check your usage as compared to last year. I bet it‚Äôs not all that different, but the Delivery Charges on the bills are making the largest increase.
It‚Äôs not you. It‚Äôs the record cold and the price of gas and electric going up from the utility companies‚Ä¶ These companies have this mass psychosis where they have brain washed everyone into being shamed like it‚Äôs their fault.

Get an energy audit that included thermal camera imaging.  We had our's done \~ 10 years ago.  They try to sell services but  we  just increase attic insulation and insulted crawl space floor.  Then, about a year later, we replaced picture window and two doors.

Also depending on the age of your heating / AC system, it may not be energy efficient.
You answered your own question, electric heat. 

Mines $600 - source also have electric heat
You have electric heat as in electric resistance, or a heat pump?

If the former: this is kind of normal. Electric resistance is the most expensive way to heat.

If a heat pump: check when your auxiliary heat is turning on. 

How well insulated is your home? 

If you have electric resistance heating, all the other devices in your home will be peanuts in terms of consumption.
I agree, something feels off and I'm really not sure what. Had the same exact issue. South jersey.
Electric heat equals really high bills
This winter is colder than last year.  My gas heating bill also went up.
What's happening is we've allowed corporations to run unchecked since Reagan and every year or two, they push us back a little bit more so they skim that little bit more off of the top. We piss and moan like we did about groceries for the last four years until everyone gets used to the new prices and now they're gouging that little bit more again. Rinse and repeat until it all crashes.
Is your aux heat kicking on?   That is most likely the culprit. Very inefficient.
I lived in a tiny 2 br apt and I was under Atlantic City electric company- we didn‚Äôt have access to our own meters to read/compare ourselves and for the first month into moving in our electric bill was $270. We cut everything out, dishwasher, dryer, switched to more efficient light bulbs, then our bill went down to $250 only. After eventually gaining access our meter, the meter reading was completely different than what our electric company was claiming. We disputed for months until finally they corrected it and we then averaged $40-60 a month and got it all back in credit. I would check the meter readings every month. Electric company also sometimes offers sending someone out for a fee to evaluate if nothing else works
gotta be the electric heat. it's been a much colder winter this year than last and I think electricity rates went up too in the past year
Electric heat is very expensive to operate.
jcpl switched us to the smart meters and i swear my rates went up instantly. don't know if we were getting under-reported on the old meter or what, but it's been very noticeable.
The price of LNG delivery has been astronomically high this last winter. LNG is used to generate electricity.  BPU is allowing the utilities to pass that on to consumers.
January was fucking cold
Do you have well or city water?
Do your own calculation instead of being helplessly ""out of ideas"". Buy a plug-in power consumption meter, or better yet (especially if your electric heater is not just plugged into outlet) - put [something like this](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Energy-Monitor-Circuit-Sensors/dp/B0C79PNK84) into your breaker panel (hire a professional electrician if you can't safely do it yourself). You'll know the exact power consumption of all your electric devices, and you'll be able to easily calculate the monetary costs of that consumption by using prices from your electrical bills.
Look into getting a mini split.  That will cut down your cooling heating cost in half at least
Same. We just got one that said our usage is ‚Äúfair‚Äù. It makes 0 sense to us as nothing has changed. We do not have electric heat. If anything it should have gone down.  We also have JCP&L. We did an audit about 10 years ago.
> ... electric heat ...

That would do it, and combined with high prices for power. 

Keep your place at a constant temp will take more power when it is cold out.
I use oil for heat. My electric bills used to average only $70/month in winter, but they‚Äôre now about $100. The price increase began after JCP&L installed ‚Äúsmart meters‚Äù to our homes.
Mine was $850 this month same size as you approx ü•≤ü•≤
My bill was $80 this month. 2800 sqft. No solar. Gas furnace. It can go as high as 300 in the worst months. Average is 120-150

How does this make sense?
WTF is happening?? I‚Äôm going to have to start reading by candlelight
dont think the prolonged drought has helped, lots of plants use water in the production process of electricity. Plus, the govt supported plan to bring nuclear power back in play greatly puts a premium on existing water supply‚Ä¶. Scarcity jacks up $ of everything as a result, even ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù goods like electricity. Just a thought
I know what‚Äôs going on, electricity companies are bending us over. Majority of people in jersey have insane bills in the past year
It won't matter if the heat is fueled by electricity or gas. It was really cold this winter and it happened to my bills too (I use a boiler). Now that the summer is coming and your electric tariff is going up, I suggest you seal any gaps in doors and windows and place tinted film on windows facing east and west.
Solar panels, I used Trinity solar and haven‚Äôt paid an electric bill in 3 years. My wife has an electric vehicle that we charge at home and we have battery backup. I also get paid for SREC‚Äôs, $6800 so far. It washes out to about $90 month after monthly solar panel bill.
I never got an electric bill, how often do they come due?
Went from around $250 to $480. Crying in coldness
Our house is 1700 sq ft and our bill was only $175 last month. We have mini splits and only heat/cool the rooms we are actually in (66 in winter 74 summer) unless we have guests and also put in double paned windows. Not sure if that made a difference as we did these things when we first bought the house three years ago.
Hot water heater
Hey, have you looked into solar panels for your home? Not all homes get enough sun to make a difference but I work at a solar company in NJ and there are many homeowners who benefit from going solar.  Those monthly bills are very high and can be reduced if your roof gets enough sun and there‚Äôs enough space for a system. 

Other ways to make a difference could be switching out all light bulbs to LED. Costly up front but those bulbs last way longer and use way less energy. 

Perhaps the windows or doors could be reinforced with insulation around them. 

It‚Äôs been a seriously cold winter and utility companies have no problems charging delivery fees and hiking up the rates.  Solar will allow you to control your rate for years ahead.  Good luck.
Even when things are off, they're still plugged in, which is draining electricity, and that contributes to the bill amount. 

This includes your devices that you log off. They're still ""on"" while they're plugged into the outlets and surgers.
Do we got our electricity from Canada? They upped the price on the electric since trumps trade wars. Not sure if we‚Äôre affected but parts of NY are
It's always the heating, get rid of the central heating that's just energy been wasted. And heat only the spaces you're occupying.¬†


Turn off your heating when you aren't there.
Electric heat is very expensive.  Consider changing to a heat pump.  We have a fully electric house, new so well insulated, and our highest bill this past winter during the cold spell was $400 for 2000sf.  I also have an induction stove which is more efficient.  Still high, but better than your experience.
everything is going all electric what did everybody think was going to happen? They tell you to go all electric to save the environment
To influence your electric bill usage, behold: AC heating/cooling, water heater are top users‚Ä¶ refrigerator and clothes dryer are typically next, everything else after that.

Mine is $70 per month.  That's why I didn't get a house.
I live in Delaware. It‚Äôs the same thing here.
I‚Äôm on electric. Florida,  so big summer  bills, 8 months of year. But our highest is $350 in dead summer and we keep it cold,2000 sq foot house, 2 people.
I have PSEG and my bill is incredibly high in January February from heat and July August from AC 
It‚Äôs the delivery charge that is the most infuriating and chunk of the bill
Prolong cold weather and higher electric demand in the state.

More EV use = more electric demand = higher electricity delivery cost.
I thought energy prices were going down on day one.
It ain‚Äôt the electric companies though, these rate changes have been state-wide. Thats BPU territory. If it was a single company it would be one thing. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt be upset about the price increases, but getting angry at the wrong source won‚Äôt help.
700$ because of electric heat and cold weather? Even when it was no more than 300$ in the peak of winter last year? Doesn‚Äôt even make sense
This!  My energy and gas usage was almost exactly the same this year as it was last year but the delivery charges were so much higher (with PSEG). I did have a minor gas leak but I doubt it was enough to effect the bill so dramatically.
This is a good point. Compare not just the dollars but the kWh on the bill to a year ago. Perhaps the usage has gone up a little bit but the cost per kWh has also gone up?

If your usage itself is a lot higher, perhaps you want an HVAC person to take a look at the system.

Also if you want to reduce your costs in general two pieces of advice:
- is your heat a heat pump or resistance heating? If the latter, seriously consider a heat pump, they are far more efficient
- consider solar if you have a good home orientation for jt. It can be very worth it especially with costs going up. Just so avoid any sort of a lease or PPA situation unless you really understand it.
Yeah, it's a bit ridiculous. A 60 watt equivalent LED bulb is like $5-10 per year if you NEVER shut it off. A large TV on 10 hours per day might cost something like $20 per month, at most. Meanwhile, the heat and AC that we can't control without freezing in the winter or boiling in the summer costs hundreds per month.
> These companies have this mass psychosis where they have brain washed everyone into being shamed like it‚Äôs their fault. You‚Äôre leaving lights on! Your heats too high!

Case in point, we got a letter from JCP&L saying our electric usage was nearly triple the ""average home"".  My wife was asking what we're doing that would cause that so I went through and did the math and found that we're using something like 34 kWh a day or so.  The average US home uses about 30 kWh per day, and I have an EV, so I'd expect ours to be a bit higher (offset by our gasoline bills being a lot lower).  As I went through this, it appears that they were trying to say that the average NJ home that they were comparing us to was only using something like 10 kWh per day.  That's a flat out ridiculous number unless the ""average"" NJ home is now a toolshed (housing prices aside, it's really not).  The numbers they're using are just completely made up.
In NJ, utilities are state-regulated monopolies. The NJ Board of Public Utilities sets rates.
It‚Äôs like the equivalent of us being told that using paper straws will end climate change. The icecaps are melting because it‚Äôs your fault you didn‚Äôt recycle that cat food can! Don‚Äôt blame the corporations!
PSEG offers a free audit annually. They also have good rebate programs for insulation.
I'm cheap so I bought a $200 thermal imaging camera you can connect to your phone on Amazon, scoped out my house, then returned it.
Check your actual usage versus last year. Though I also had my meter replaced recently and my winter electric was double what it normally was.
Know of any reputable places?
Yes I got solar installed last year and my electric bill is low, I have natural gas heat  but brought some electric space heaters to use instead to keep my heating bill low
Lol.. solar bill was going to cost me over $400/mth when my electric bill averaged $150. Solar is not a great deal in NJ.
Vampiric consumption contributes very little to your bill.¬†


People just bought fully in to that ""you shouldn't turn off your heating but let the thermostat regulate it nonsense"".


And how people still taking about lights in this day and age.
Almost all of our energy is generated in state.
Yeah but that was this month and the lowest bill.
Yeah watch their plumbing supply lines freeze with that logic
I did this in a college apartment. It‚Äôs a solid strategy if you‚Äôre super cheap. We had a single space heater and wore lots of blankets and stuff, but had plenty of party funds!
Heat pump may not have helped this winter as it was so much colder than many heat pumps can efficiently handle, dumping into auxiliary heat. Depends on the unit, but the ones that handle low temperatures can be big bucks.
Blaming EV‚Äôs for increased prices. I like how you slid that in there.
Along with egg prices and an end to the war in Ukraine, but here we are. Gotta love the BS
Day one isn‚Äôt over yet. Soon though.
It‚Äôs both, the electric companies are paying more for LNG and BPU is allowing them to pass that along to the consumers.  Seriously, follow Mr. Global on TikTok.  Dude explains it in captivating detail.
It's not just New Jersey--folks who use PECO in PA have also had rates through the roof recently.
Certainly the electric heat doesn‚Äôt help.  But if this isn‚Äôt due to electric price change, what changed from last year? Wasn‚Äôt it a bit warmer overall other than like a week of cold weather?  We had it pretty cold this winter..

Where/what do you live?  Maybe somebody else tapped into your electric?  Seen it before in non-single family arrangements 

Assuming no electric vehicle charging‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt mean to alarm you, but your supply charges will go up another 20% June 1. Be prepared.
Average temps last winter were higher by about 5-8F, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it does have a great affect. My gas usage was up noticeably this winter compared to last
Electric heat is insanely expensive. I don't know what your exact rates are, but natural gas can be 2-5x cheaper than electric.

You can improve that significantly if you have a heat pump, which is way more efficient than resistive electric, but if it gets cold enough they stop working quite as well
Yes. This winter was the first actually cold winter in over 10 years.
It might be small potatoes to you but I got a lot of surge protectors to plug things in, when not in use I shut them all. I have saved a lot and PSEG sends me comparisons of the costs before.
Can you post a redacted image of last year's bill? Also it was relatively warmer winter 2023-2024
No more than what you would be paying with propane or oil heat + electric.
Supposedly the kwh supply rate won‚Äôt be different until June.

But it‚Äôs that bullshit delivery fee that we‚Äôre all paying for PSE&G executives to rip lines of coke off of sex workers‚Äô bodies, get too excited during erotic asphyxiation (which they[we] paid extra for) then accidentally kill said sex worker, then have to pay for an organized crime syndicate to help dispose of the bodies, and pay the monthly blackmail vig.
If you look at everything they put out, the state says an average home is 650 kwh/month. PSEG says 683, ACE says 680, JC says 750. We shake out close to that 750 in central NJ (gas heat, central air, no pool), but I feel like we're pretty efficient overall, so I'm shocked that we're barely ""average.""
Does their audit include thermal imaging?
I have been looking into this recently, it seems that a lot of public libraries have some to lend out also
Just got an e-mail for [NJNG for their program](https://www.savegreen.com/residential/whole-home-energy-assessments.aspx?utm_source=SAPHybris&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=1325&utm_term=SG_Personalized%20Email_032025_FINAL___Pick%20your%20Whole%20Home%20Energy%20Assessment%20today&utm_content=No%20SAVEGREEN___EN).

Not in NJ but Mr Air NYC is the best I've came across.   https://www.mrairnyc.com/
That's not at all the experience I had. Our roof is really well positioned for solar, so with enough panels the system pays for itself during spring, summer and early fall. Were you looking at a lease or a solar loan?
Ahh, I see. Have you tried opting into the budgeted payments for JCPL?  You‚Äôll still pay for the electric you use but the monthly bill would be closer to the avg across the year rather than fluctuating by seasons.
My stepfather has an HVAC business and still complains about light usage lol. He should know better.
Only about 75% is generated in-state.
Also kind of ignores thermodynamics
Heating spaces you aren't in is just wasteful.¬†


That being said i like being a lil bit cold.
Ok, keep telling yourself utility companies won‚Äôt want to charge more when demand for it goes up.
Hey I‚Äôm just glad that our student loans were all forgiven, the federal minimum wage was raised to $15hr, and the manufacturing and sale of assault weapons was banned.
Electric companies in NJ don't own power plants or generate electricity. They buy it on the wholesale market for those who don't contract with their own supplier. The wholesale market is up in the entire PJM territory, which is basically Ohio to Virginia. Everyone in these states is getting a price shock this year.
This winter was literally the coldest in a decade *and* last year was relatively mild, so the price shock is to be expected.
Another way to look at this is heating degree days. Heating Degree Days measure how much and how long outdoor temperatures fall below 65¬∞F, indicating the demand for heating. We had 11% more HDD in 2024-2025 than the previous year.

The colder it gets, the temperature difference between inside and outside increases, so your heating system has to work harder to maintain indoor comfort. The key point is that heat loss from a building isn‚Äôt linear. It increases more rapidly as the temperature outside gets colder, so the colder it gets, the harder (and more frequently) your heating system has to run, often exponentially increasing energy use.
iirc it has to be near 0 farenheit for modern heat pumps to really lose effectiveness. it's gotten a lot better than in past years to the point that you'd have to run your eheat a lot less.
The kwh supply rate goes up every June. I'm a JC customer and my supply rate went up 8% last year and now 20% this coming June. Delivery rate went up about 6%, but for electric my bill is still 60+% supply/38-40% delivery. My NJNG gas bill on the other hand is more like 65% delivery/35% supply.
I'd be willing to bet small apartments are dragging those averages down.  The national average is about 30 kWh per day, or about 900 kWh per month.  If you're using 750 a month for a standalone house, you're probably doing pretty well, not ""barely average"".  I have a 2 story, 4 bedroom Cape, central air/gas heat, and an EV charger and I'm somewhere around 35 - 40 kWh/day last time I looked.  Probably a bit more now as I'm driving more.
Did they come quickly after you set it up?
It was 50k. You do realize that whether it's a loan, lease, or you pay cash it just means that you're moving the cost of electric to the cost of your solar.
.... What does that have to do with the benefits of solar? My point was solar would have made my electric costs more expensive.
Right. Almost all. Glad we could agree.

edit: actually, it looks like it‚Äôs more like 90% generated in state:

https://www.electricrate.com/the-top-electricity-generation-sources-in-new-jersey/
Of course they‚Äôll be ant to charge more, but don‚Äôt act like the EV infrastructure is so widespread and available that companies can justify raising costs based on its use. We‚Äôre not even close to that. And in the long run, use of EV‚Äôs on a massive scale will be far more beneficial than gas powered vehicles.

When I did it with JCPL like 10 years ago - it was like a week and they gave me a 4 hour window.  Back then the report was free.  I see NJNG detail report costs $49.
This feels a little hostile, but I'll keep going. Yes, I do realize the cost is being moved around. I got my solar installed with the intention of introducing more green energy to the grid as the first reason and protecting myself from the cost increases associated with delivery pricing as the second.¬†


I thought it was crazy that you were being quoted at $400/month - even with my values I wouldn't be able to justify that expense. Like if it doesn't even break even with your current electric bills you can't be expected to install the system. I was wondering how they were trying to justify that price.
Ok just trying to help. Your initial post was asking for ideas to lower electric costs. I suggested solar, you had already looked into it. Another idea was to opt into the monthly budgeted program.  Best of luck
The EIA report that links to says it was 80% in-state generation in 2023. That has gone down as generation hasn't increased at the pace consumption has. It was about 75% last year. My dad and uncle are knee-deep in this for a living. 

  
We don't get electricity from Canada, so the tariffs there won't affect us. It comes from other PJM states.
Not hostile. Just telling you that solar value is wildly different across the country. Oh and that cost was assuming I gave them the tax credits too!
I'm not the OP. I never asked for advice to lower my electric bill. I replied to your comment saying solar was not a good deal in NJ.
Oops looks like I got confused.  Again, just trying to help.  I have solar on my home and it‚Äôs been a good investment financially. Every household is different."
Observations after being here a week. Am I correct?,"Decided to try and move here and am staying in a hotel in central NJ. Likely moving to Morristown if I decide to stay. The following negatives I've noticed so far:

1) Crazy drivers. I wouldn't say bad drivers, but crazy in terms of the risks they take while endangering others.

2) Food is mediocre. It seems like the majority of places are tiny mom and pop shops with a few high end restaurants sprinkled in. I've tried so many highly rated pizza places by now and ultimately they taste no better than chain pizza. As a matter of fact I prefer chain pizza. In addition, things close very early so late night eating isn't easy to do. I tried going to a well rated chinese joint and they started closing at 8:30. Took me 20 minutes to get there and I got so frustrated trying to find another decent chinese place that wasn't 30 minutes away, that I just went to a nearby pizza shop and called it a night.

3) The roads are terrible. Piss poor layout resulting in awkward last minute lane changes, many near misses, tons of potholes, and traffic from hell, mainly due to the roads being so awkwardly laid out. It takes upwards of 30-45 minutes just to go 10 miles.

4) Everything seems super spread out for a place that is described as tightly packed. Do people generally stay in their town or is travel between towns common?

5) Tolls, endless tolls",0.12,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jh0pdc/observations_after_being_here_a_week_am_i_correct/,15,1jh0pdc,2025-03-22 04:41,"I stopped reading when you typed that you prefer chain pizza.

1. Your third point explains this negative observation.

2. You sound like my late nana, who once said that a burger from McDonald's was better (and she could only get it for $1!) than the restaurant we were at. The restaurant was Charlie's in Bay Head.

3. ""Traffic from hell"" is because we're so tightly packed (point 4). If you're in the heart of Morristown, there's plenty of walkability while still having access to major highways and transit. 

4. The closer you get to the metropolitan areas (NYC/Philly) the denser the population will get. NJ is brilliantly odd in that it has both incredibly dense and incredibly rural swaths. If you travel the length of I-78, you'll understand. For me, traveling among towns is common.

5. Select the ""avoid tolls"" option on your GPS. Will it take longer to get to your destination? Yes, but you'll find some hidden gems along the way. 

Good luck!

PSA for NJ Homeowners: Please Think Twice Before Signing ‚Äú$0 Down‚Äù Roof or Solar Financing Deals,"Hey NJ folks,

Just wanted to drop a quick PSA here for anyone considering a new roof or solar install this year. I‚Äôve been in the building materials and construction space for a long time‚Äîfirst as a distributor selling to contractors, and later as a contractor myself. Over the years, I‚Äôve gained a unique perspective, and honestly‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen some things that don‚Äôt sit right with me.

Lately, there‚Äôs been a big rise in ‚Äú$0 down‚Äù or ‚Äúno payments for 18‚Äì24 months‚Äù financing offers for roofing and solar projects. And while the marketing sounds great, the reality is that many of these deals come with dealer fees that can quietly add 20‚Äì30% to your total project cost. That means a $20K roof could end up costing you $25K+ without you even realizing it.

If you qualify for financing, you‚Äôre almost always better off getting a quote at a true cash price and then going to your local credit union or bank to secure your own financing. You‚Äôll usually get better terms and avoid inflated pricing.

This is especially common in solar, where roof replacements get bundled into the solar financing and the homeowner is never really told what the roof alone should cost. Transparency matters, and unfortunately, it‚Äôs something that gets lost in the sales process way too often.

If you live in NJ and are looking into roof or solar work, I‚Äôm happy to offer some honest perspective or help you break down a quote‚Äîno sales pitch, just real info. This stuff can get confusing fast, and I‚Äôve always believed that homeowners deserve to make informed decisions.

Feel free to DM me if you have questions or just want a second set of eyes on something.

Stay smart, NJ.

not wrong at all

to take it a step further, home solar projects are terrible ROI 99% of the time. Don't even bother
What's a ballpark estimate for putting like 1000 Sq feet of solar roofing on my house with a flat roof? The roof itself is just a few years old, so it's just the solar.

I've been considering it but have no reference for what it should cost.
AI art gives away that you're not respectable¬†
A neighbor put up solar panels. The installer clear cut a dozen mature trees from all sides of the house. Last time I looked into, the phone rep told me the same thing would be necessary. I get that panels don‚Äôt work without as much sun as possible, but if the lack of shade pushes my cooling load sky-high, is it really a net gain?
Is there anyone who knows a good solar company that will install panels in the ground instead of on the roof? I‚Äôve had a 3 big companies come out and they all said they can do it but flaked after.
If you are financing your panels you are making a mistake. If you are not *buying* your panels (someone else owns them and you lease/ own the electricity) , you are making a mistake


This isn't a ""think twice"" thing. Its a mistake 100% of the time.


If you don't have the cash stashed away for doing a solar install, why are you doing it?! The payoff for -just cash- is still a LOONG LOONG time. Especially if you get a battery system - like 30 years before you go neutral on your investment from the savings on your EBILL.


That type of investment only makes sense if:

- you have the cash on hand and will ride out the 30 years

- you have access to the cash at stupidly low interest rates that won't push out the 30 year timeframe. Or you can use a 401k loan which you pay the interest back to yourself - but then you miss out on all the market gains (but will there be any with this admin?)
Anyone dumb enough to sign these things without doing any research deserves to get taken for a ride.
After we got our solar quote (from a great individual installer, not a corporate sales team) we found a green credit union specializing is solar loans. 

They had an option where you could potentially use your tax rebate as your down payment. We didn‚Äôt use this option as we had money put aside for the solar install, but this might be a good option for people wanting to get solar but more tight on cash.
Solar roofs are so ugly. Mess up neighborhoods. Whether you have the taste and self awareness to realize it‚Ä¶ solar roofs are ugly. Dont do it‚Ä¶ Your neighbors thank you in advance.
Indeed! Due diligence is of great importance!
1000%. Hence, The, reputation of the ‚Äúused car salesman‚Äù Unfortunately, some of these sales tactics have evolved into other industries.
I was wondering the same lol thanks¬†
Solar can work really well for some homes, but it‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all solution. A lot depends on the roof, shading, usage patterns, and especially how it‚Äôs financed. Ownership through a loan sounds appealing, but many solar loans require that you repay the 30% federal tax credit to the lender within the first year, if not, your payments go up. And when ownership isn‚Äôt viable, the main alternative offered is a lease or pay-per-use model, which comes with its own trade-offs.

That said, the contrast is worth considering: every dollar spent on your utility bill is a 100% loss. It doesn‚Äôt build equity, and rates continue to rise. On average. It‚Äôs 6 to 8% annually. But in Jersey this June, It‚Äôs gonna be going up near 20%.
This ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è. And ugly for neighborhood aesthetic.
Literally call up a solar company and get an estimate!

Two tips for this:

1) do not use Sunrun. Good god do not use them. IDK why Costco partners with them. They will quote you close to double what any other installer will quote AND they'll be aggressively trying to trick you into signing documents that lock you in even at investigation time.

READ EVERYTHING YOU GET BEFORE YOU SIGN IT FROM A SOLAR COMPANY.

2) Find a *local* solar installer and see what they'll quote. I mean literally googling ""solar installers near me"" and finding ""Dick's Shiny Solar LLC"" and getting an estimate from him. You can also ask your neighbors who didn't kill themselves after signing with Sunrun who they used and get a quote from them.

3) Go to GreenPowerEnergy and see what they'll quote. They have the benefit of being bigger than your local ""mom and pop"" solar shop, but not so big that they can afford to rake you over the coals like Sunrun does.
Greenpower only services 3 states. And NJ is one of em ;)
I‚Äôll send you a direct message. It‚Äôs not necessarily by square footage, and there are some variables pertaining to the roofs position to southern son exposure, as well as the utility consumption.
This. You could have used any of the eighty bajillion free to use photos of homes or solar panels or money but you chose to use AI garbage
oh good lord lmao

yes how not respectable!
I get the frustration with AI visuals, I use it just to make an image specific to what I‚Äôm saying not mislead or come off as gimmicky. But to be Frank, it‚Äôs not going anywhere, so why not use it for clarity.  

What not respectable is individuals in the industry offering things as free when they simply are not.
Yeah, that's a job that could have gone to a professional illustrator!


This is like the least harmful use of AI, I get that we're inundated with the shit but its a fucking Reddit post, not a company firing it's marketing team.
Great question‚Äîand honestly, that‚Äôs a real concern most reps don‚Äôt bring up.

As a solar pro, I‚Äôd never recommend clear-cutting mature trees without doing a proper energy trade-off analysis. Sometimes, the cooling loss outweighs the solar gain, especially if shading plays a big role in your home‚Äôs efficiency.

A good installer should evaluate both your sun exposure and your home‚Äôs energy behavior before making any big calls. If you ever want a second look with transparency in mind, happy to help.
Shoot me a DM. Happy to quote out of ground amount system for you. Providing you have the space and the opportunity to ideally position panels to Southern exposure. That‚Äôs your best bet. The closer to the home, the better, as the longer the trenching that is needed to connect the system to the house, The higher it can drive up cost. But nonetheless, absolutely doable.
Yes and no, some of these people are vultures -  some were hard selling my elderly neighbors - their children live out-of-state - luckily they asked me as I help them on occasion.
Totally get the frustration‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to feel that way. But from someone who‚Äôs spent two decades in the roofing and solar space here in NJ, I can say the problem is a lot deeper than just homeowners ‚Äúnot doing research.‚Äù The unfortunate reality is that many companies build their entire business models around high-pressure, scripted sales tactics designed to overwhelm or mislead‚Äîespecially when people are vulnerable or feel rushed.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been making it a point to speak up more lately. The industry desperately needs more transparency and less noise. Not every homeowner knows what to look for‚Äîbut that shouldn‚Äôt make them a target.
That‚Äôs a great point‚Äîand definitely something more people should be aware of.

One issue with many solar-specific loans is that lenders already factor in the 30% federal tax credit, so they often require a large lump-sum payment (equal to that 30%) within the first 12‚Äì18 months.

If you don‚Äôt make that payment, the loan re-amortizes and your monthly payment jumps up significantly. It catches a lot of folks off guard.

That‚Äôs why some homeowners go the route of independent financing through a credit union or bank‚Äîso they can treat it like a cash purchase and manage payments on their own terms, without risking tax credit complications or surprise payment hikes.
How do they mess up neighborhoods? Offending your delicate sensibilities doesn't count.
Totally agree‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also a reminder that not all solar is the same. Some systems still use bulky, outdated panels, while others offer sleek, low-profile designs that blend right into the roof. It makes a big difference.
Good luck finding an image that says anything about the truth regarding zero down. Everything that‚Äôs available on Google are images that say zero down and they deceive individuals with misleading statements.
ü§™
You used AI to not seem gimmicky? Lmfao
You‚Äôre spot on‚Äîand I really respect that you‚Äôre looking out for your neighbors. I‚Äôve seen firsthand how aggressive some of these reps can be, especially with elderly homeowners or those whose family isn‚Äôt nearby. Sadly, this type of predatory approach has become the norm for many roofing and solar outfits in NJ.

It‚Äôs disheartening, especially after being in this industry for 20+ years and watching how far things have drifted from what it used to be. Hopefully with more honest conversations like this, we can start steering the industry back toward integrity and transparency. Appreciate you sharing your perspective.
The solar people offered us $10K cash to install solar on our house. I was a firm no because they would be managing all the electrical payments and we would pay a flat $250 or so a month (which worked out to more than we‚Äôre paying now annually on average). The solar company would receive all tax breaks and all payment for power sent ‚Äúback to the grid.‚Äù

To be honest, the more cash the company offered, the more I felt like it couldn‚Äôt be a good decision for me long term. I would rather get financing to install my own. I can‚Äôt feel like a random door to door salesman has my best interests at heart.
They ruin the character of neighborhoods. Since you came at me when i wasnt looking for you, I‚Äôm going to guess your neighborhood has zero character like your personality. And you have an ugly solar roof thats like your personality.
Why did you need this specific image? The title of your content is interesting enough folks would click without it.
Literally, and I don't understand the argument for clarity when the image is generic AF to begin with. It's just laziness to use AI.
Yep, wild concept, right? Imagine‚Ä¶using a tool to better illustrate a point instead of slapping on some random stock photo and calling it a day. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I mean, If that‚Äôs ‚Äúgimmicky,‚Äù then clarity must be terrifying.
I ran the number for my house about three years ago.  If I leased the panel the ROI was \~15 years and then I would have to worry about the lease transfer if I sold my home.   If I purchased,   with new roof,  ROI was 8.5 years - just does not make sense.
I‚Äôm glad you stuck to your gun and intuition on that one. The ‚Äúcash back‚Äù installs are the absolute biggest scams.

They simply build it into your financing agreement. I‚Äôve seen all sorts of ‚Äúcash back‚Äù offered by installers (whom Ive roof replacements for) and later learned that the sales rep was simply adding money to the loan to cover it!!!
That's the same as ""they offend you"". Which seems pretty easy.
How do you breathe with your head shoved so far up your own ass?
Because if I use any other image that said zero down, it‚Äôs gonna look like an advertisement. So the goal is to point out the truth behind ‚Äúzero down‚Äù, not mislead.
Look if you're gonna promote your business and you can't afford pay someone to do your art, most people will see right through you
Yeah, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for all houses. I‚Äôve seen some homeowners that are covered and trees, have roofs that are not even south facing, yet have inefficient Solar panels installed on their roofs. Instances Like That, people end up with two bills, instead of eliminating One. Although there are many homeowners that it can make sense for, but because it‚Äôs most often misrepresented ‚Äì theyignored all altogether.
Your first nasty reply tells me that you are old. Im not going back and forth with grandpa over the value of neighborhood aesthetics. Go ‚Äòwork outside‚Äô today.
I am arguing you didn't need an image at all. Or if you used your title any semi related image would work.


Don't use AI images. Holy smokes.
Promoting? There‚Äôs no business link, no pitch, just info. If someone wants to talk, they‚Äôll reach out. Not sure why AI art hit such a nerve‚Ä¶lol embrace it, it‚Äôs not going anywhere.
It made sense for my brother, however the squirrels built nests underneath the panels - damaging the roof and had to have the panels removed to repair the roof.
Ah, apologies for using a tool that helps create the exact image I had in mind. My bad for trying to be too clear. lol
Yeah, unfortunately that‚Äôs more common than some people think. Especially with older panels. Part of the problem is that so manufactures were using oil coding on the wires that were actually peanut arrived. Many of the wiring casings were literally chewed apart by the squirrels as well.
AI art steals from artists, it doesn't just pull images out of thin air. As a graphic designer, your image is generic so I don't know how you couldn't just have used clip art and Canva for 10 minutes to get the same effect. Don't be lazy, people will judge you and your message for using AI art.
The AI helped visualize my point, nothing more. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm selling AI art. lol Can‚Äôt please everyone. The majority of ppl got the point without feelings.
It doesn't matter if you're selling it, you're still feeding into it's algorithm and if you do a little research, you'll find out how use of AI contributes to our environmental crisis.
You‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ I should‚Äôve hired a sketch artist to draw it on recycled paper, then uploaded it with a solar-powered camera.
I don't think you need to worry about your message when your attitude is showing you literally have no ability at reflection and introspection, but go off, I guess."
Interesting idea for a book or a movie,"With all the current events, I keep thinking of this idea but I'm not writer so don't know where to go with it. Let me know what you folks think.

It's the beginning of 2025, Government is about to have some crazy changes and releases some vague details that confirm extraterrestrial contact. Up north under a New Jersey military base, they use alien tech to open a portal to a different world/dimension. What they see is a desolate world, void of any natural resources. An alien worm-like creature jumps through the portal and immediately digs even deeper underground. It lives by consuming all the natural resources until the world is destroyed. What better place to find those resources than abandoned mine shafts. It starts consuming and creating voids that cause sink holes. Government, in an attempt to track the creature, releases all different types of aerial drones to scan the area. They do that at night so not to cause hysteria, but it backfires. To force other countries to help without telling them what's going on, US threatens to take over other countries, which causes them to upgrade their military strength and send more radar and satellite scanning capabilities on US border.

I also agree that Fulop and Baraka are the most likely candidates that they would endorse as I really just cannot see them endorsing Sherrill, Gottheimer, Sweeney, or Spiller, but I could see them going either way with Fulop and Baraka.

Fulop has been the most critical out of all the candidates on New Jersey's Democratic Primary party line system and has been the most vocal of calling out the mainstream Democratic Party so for that reason, I could see them endorsing him, but I also could see them endorsing Baraka due to his strong rebuttals against ICE recently

Fulop gives Elizabeth Warren while Baraka gives the squad.  It‚Äôs really hard to say. I like Fulop more.
Bakara, but if they were smart it would be Fulop.
Definitely Baraka
I am a political newcomer, but I worry that we Dems will not nominate a candidate that will win in November. Having a Republican governor would be disaster, literally.
I think you're looking not for an endorsement per se, but an easy way to judge these candidates prima facie. My advice is to check out their policy page and track record -- we're choosing someone for policies that affect our everyday lives, whether that's energy prices, transit, gun laws, or housing.

[Here's an interview with our current governor that might give you some ideas on current NJ issues](https://www.wnyc.org/story/ask-governor-murphy-potential-disruption-federal-budget-cuts)
Judging from unrelenting tv commercials, it would seem Gottheimer has a massive kettle on campaign funds.
i can honestly see them not endorsing anyone. none of these candidates fully fit the profile of the kind of politician they want to endorse. baraka likely comes closest. i know people get all heart eyes at fulop because of his transit views, but he's also super pro business developer type. a lot of people i know who either live in jc now or have lived in jc during his tenure can't stand him and will not vote for him in the primary. that's who i listen to.
Probably Fulop.
Bernie probably doesn't know enough about NJ local politics to make any kind of endorsement in a primary. Being the senator from Vermont there's not much reason he would, although he did make a last minute appearance here to campaign for Phil Murphy in '21. He is a big fan of unions so maybe he'd go Spiller given what limited knowledge he has, he was a big supporter of Osbourne in Nebraska coming from a similar background. Now, NJEA members aren't Spiller's biggest fans and given how vague Spiller still is on policy maybe Bern man just does what he's currently doing; seeing if the eventual nominee is worth endorsing. He's not a psychic and doesn't have any insider knowledge so he'd be in the same boat you are. 

As for AOC, she knows a little more obviously representing the Bronx and NYC not far away so she'd probably be bigger on Fulop or Baraka. The only times I've ever heard her speak to it though was actually about gentrification and increased cost of living in Jersey City, which might point to her leaning Baraka and of course saying Bob Menendez needs to resign, which might lean Fulop. So flip a coin there, I dunno. I would assume if she were interested enough to endorse she'd talk to both of them to see.
It's hard to say. Fulop is similar to them in the way he goes out to a lot of events and really connects with voters. However, I havn't seen him say enough against Trump and the Republican party.¬†
Fulop comes from a pro developer investment banker background. I highly doubt he's getting their endorsement.
It think Baraka hands down. He is most progressive and combative of the bunch, and comes from a street activist background. Also was a principal and spoken word poet (he is his father‚Äôs son, after all).
why would you care what two useless, far left, not from jersey people say about the election
Ras
It is painfully, obviously Baraka is much closer to them politically then anyone else in this primary.


Fulop is exactly in line with about 90% of centrist Dems and dabbles with more populist ideas.


Most of those Democrats also dabbled with populism before being elected only to fall in line with leadership after the fact.


Leadership that is absolutely radioactive at this moment. And to his credit he's smart enough to break with them now, which is the most basic of political instincts if you want to win in November.


The base isn't clamoring for East Coast Pete right now and the people out there who claim to be ""centrists"" are politically incoherent but have consistently gone for ""Change"" in most executive elections since 2008.
Elections were fun while they lasted
Man, I *really* hope they come as well. I‚Äôve never been to a political rally or seen a politician speak in person, but I‚Äôd attend 100%.
Ah the promise big and get nothing done method. Somehow I'm sure this won't be a third type of failure... /s
Throw in codified women's and lgbt healthcare too. I'd slap your name at the voting booth.
Honestly why not?

No
Fulop gives Elizabeth Warren? Isn‚Äôt the knock on him that he‚Äôs too pro business and pro real estate for progressives?
Yes and No. Baraka‚Äôs silence on George Norcross and the EMR fires in Camden is appalling.
Want a candidate who will win in November? Pick one who excites voters in the primary. 

The old notion that the most moderate or respectable candidate would be the strongest in the general, even if they have glaring weaknesses, is outdated.
Fulop is the only candidate that manages to excite progressives, moderates and independents. His message resonates with everyone.
I elephant in the room is Mikie. I‚Äôm not convinced a woman can win. Christine Todd Whitman did but there are way more immigrants now, and a lot of immigrants don‚Äôt see women as viable candidates. I hate to say this, but many I talked to wouldn‚Äôt vote Harris for this reason, explicitly given. ‚ÄúDo you really think a woman can govern?‚Äù type comments.
I remember when candidates running on policy was more important than just railing against the GOP. Let‚Äôs stick to that.
He was in investment banking for a few years after graduating. He enlisted in the US Marine Corps following 9/11. And was deployed to Iraq as part of the ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù mission. He was also informed by his ancestral roots. His grandmother is a holocaust survivor. His father a deli owner. There is a much fuller picture of him that is impressive and more than what you portray
Development is a tool every mayor uses and every municipality needs.  Bottom line is he has developed responsibly.  So he gets a lot of credit for that.  With all of the housing he‚Äôs built, remember all of the affordable housing that came along with it. The man has done a lot of good.
My brother who lives in JC says everyone is sick of him.
His dad was an antisemitic black nationalist who wrote essays about raping white women. You can check his Wikipedia, ""Amiri Baraka"". 

I think Ras should try to be as politically separate from his family as possible, but he publicly speaks fondly of his father.
Elections aren't gonna get canceled especially at the state level that's fear mongering
A rally at prudential or PNC with all three of them would be so cool I‚Äôd clear my schedule for sure
I've been pretty much on message on my official social media for like 15 years. Skepticism is healthy.
NJ codified abortion rights, which is one of the main reasons I‚Äôll never leave this state.
i've been to a fulop event and dude knows his shit.
I‚Äôve been to a couple of his meet and greets and Fulop is a policy wonk like Warren.  The man is like a Google search engine. I have not seen him dodge one question. Even when he doesn‚Äôt know the answer, he manages to give a good answer. 

And to answer your question, he talks a lot about a millionaire‚Äôs tax. Which is right up my girl Liz‚Äôs alley.
He is a policy wonk. Fair. Straightforward. Listens to everyone
The way he runs JC doesn‚Äôt excite anyone who lives there.
mikie is too middle of the road for aoc to even think about honestly.
That's when politics were boring. We can't have that again until we deal with the extremists that have flooded the GOP.
There's a weird sickness going around. Where politics have turned into WWE, WWF, and WCW wrestling instead of intellectual debate. It's happening to Democrats, also.  
  
You can see this on r/50501NJ. People want to fight, protest, and destroy. Not talk or listen.
Not doubting your brother - but fulop kept getting re elected with landslide numbers -
In the 2021 the last election he got 67.3% of the vote.  That‚Äôs an insane number
He‚Äôs awful
I‚Äôve been a fan of Amiri Baraka‚Äôs poetry for years. Not all of it. And his widow says they made mistakes. He was a complicated creative artist who went too far at times. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt hold anything against his son for his father‚Äôs poetry.
There was a lot of things we told ourselves would never happen in 2016 and look at as now üåà
Absolutely. I wonder if they take requests? üëÄ
Sure, but have you ever affected an actual policy, is this just 15 years of social media posts? For all the ""failures in leadership"" of Democrats and Republicans, they have  results behind them -- NJ is one of the most populous states, with a thriving economy. Where as you're promising to ""stop payments to the federal government"" -- which to the best of my knowledge, is income tax remitted by citizens directly to the federal government.

I mean this as kindly as possible: We've tried hiring inexperienced people for the job, and given the 10% drop in the stock market, I'm not a believer.
I'm never leaving either unless it's not this country. I like my discrimination protections. We just need gender affirming care protected now too. There's a bill in committee right now that further protects abortion as well as gender affirming care for both patients and providers in addition too, S3490
Glad to hear the dude knows his shit, but I am not sure what that has to do with my question
Why is 99.8% of your post history about Fulop? This is the absolute laziest way for his campaign team to try and contol social media. Do better Steve.

Can you plant accounts at least pretend to care about anything else?
My hesitation re Fulop is that he gets snippy with questioners. Also defensive. I understand he wants to defend, but he can tone down the aggression towards constituents.
I agree she tries to straddle all factions of the party. Dangerous and rarely works, unless it‚Äôs the rare talented candidate like Obama.
Policy is the most important thing. It‚Äôs ok to throw a jab here and there, but just running on being anti-Trump isn‚Äôt going to win elections. Now, if they explain *how* their policies will counter Trump and MAGA, that‚Äôs a different story.
When things get really bad talking and listening may only get so far.¬†
Hey, I‚Äôm cool with him. 12 years of the same mayor, I‚Äôd probably grumble too
Fulop has a negative vibe. Maybe it will be what people want, but he does not exude optimism.
You can not be a fan of it but it wasn't creativity going to far. Again, I'll quote only from his Wikipedia page: 

""Smile jew. Dance, jew. Tell me you love me, jew. I got something for you ... I got the extermination blues, jewboys. I got the hitler syndrome figured ... So come for the rent, jewboys ... one day, jewboys, we all, even my wig wearing mother gonna put it on you all at once.""

I fear a lot of his fathers radical views are rubbing off on his son.
Honest question: Name some examples

Understood, you want people who participated in the system that fucked us, enable it, and will continue to perpetuate it for campaign funding. Lets be real, a majority of people who play the game and keep a clean persona are working an angle that keeps the wolves at bay.

Need advice for registering a small business in NJ,"Hi! I live in NJ and I'm planning to start a side business doing some graphics design work. I don't expect to generate a lot of revenue, at least not in the beginning.

Currently I'm leaning towards sole proprietorship over LLC.

I have a few questions on registering my business with the state. What are your recommendations on:

1. Getting EIN vs using my SSN,

2. Getting a mailbox with street address vs using my home address,

3. Using my legal name to register vs using a DBA,

4. Registering the business by myself vs hiring a CPA or registered agent to help,

5. Come next year, filing my tax return by myself vs finding a CPA

Do your own book keeping to keep the cost lower.  Spreadsheets or bookkeeping software if you know it.

You can use a UPS Store mailbox but banks will require your home address.
It‚Äôs really a matter of whether you need or want the limited liability from the legal entity‚Ä¶

While the form says to use your ssn, everybody I know will use a ein.  Admittedly, that is helpful, to not be giving out your personal ssn

The formation is simple in nj.  Done online and pay with credit card with small fee.  Then go get the ein from the irs.

A post office box can be nice for business use.  But your home address will need to be used for formation and bank stuff..  we have post offices that can received FedEx and ups, just double check.  There is a street address variant you can use‚Ä¶

CPA‚Ä¶ of course you really should, maybe until you get the hang of it.  The key is to get your bookkeeping in order so you can track all your expenses.  You might have some depreciation of equipment.  

Did I miss anything?  Happy to help.  Good luck
Why not contact [NJ Small Business Development Center](https://njsbdc.com/)? This is their wheelhouse and it's free.
Do you mean hiring a CPA to register my business or hiring a CPA to do my taxes?
For your taxes. You can register your business on your own without any trouble.  

You can consult with a CPA about which type to register for.  Mine recommend Sole Proprietorship until revenue was over 50k then change to what read appropriate.
Thanks for the advice! Can I transition my sole prop to LLC and keep the name of my business?
If that name doesn't already exist,  probably.  You'd have to find out to be sure."
Botox at home?,"Does anyone know of a ""visiting botox"" service that will come and do the treatments at your house?

Convenience. Confort.

Botox party with some friends?
You know what‚Äôs very inconvenient and uncomfortable? A skin infection. There‚Äôs a reason injecting things into your face at home isn‚Äôt really all that popular‚Ä¶.
This is highly abnormal. It's scorned on by the public. This is dangerous and you should shop.  
  
You've probably heard that before. You'll keep hearing this when you post in the real world, not the social bubble of a pro botox community.
Botox is just injections w a needle. Preventing infection has to do with sterile needles, sterile Botox solution and skin prep (thorough cleaning, alcohol pads or an antiseptic like chlorhexidine etc).  If the provider is professional and following sterile techniques and precautions it would be as safe as in a clinic. Clinics aren't sterile in itself. The chair/table you sit on isn't sterile.  Hand washing, sterile instruments and skin cleansing is what will be best at preventing an infection.  

I work in an ER. It's dirty as hell. We inject, suture, open abscesses, do all sorts of minor surgical procedures. The only thing that is required is sterile gloves plus what I mentioned earlier. The rooms and tables being used by hundreds of people each day are probably more risky then a clean home. Between patients we pull a piece of paper from a roll to cover the table, that's about the extent of ""cleaning"" that gets done between patients. If blood, pus or whatever other bodily fluids spill, we take sani wipe and wipe it down. 

I'd say enjoy your Botox party, as a doctor I wouldn't have any issue having one myself if I was into that sort of thing. But I'm 50 and people keep asking me when I'm graduating school (2003) so right now I'm good lol. 

I don't mean to sound arrogant or obnoxious but just pointing out the reality of the situation. You do what you feel is best for you.

Who else had this happen to them? EZ Pass tag was not read at toll gate- now 'I' have to pay a fine.,"I have an EZ Pass account and tag I go through a number of toll gates every single day without problems.

I just received a letter from EZ Pass NY to say that in December 2024 I went through two toll gates and that I had two outstanding amounts to pay. Apparently another letter had already been sent before but I had not received it. The two toll fees are $8.25 and $11.63.

I have no idea why my EZ Pass tag was not read by the toll gate. When I drive through one of them, I usually make sure that the display at the tool gate/booth always confirms that my EZ Pass had been read.

Now I have to pay them $125.28 as they added two $50 late fees on top.

\- EZ Pass knows that I have a tag. EZ Pass photographed my license plate number.

\- I have automatic payments/replenishment enabled.

\- The fact that my EZ PAs tag failed on those two occasions very likely has nothing to do with me, but rather their own equipment failure.

\- They have my email, phone number and address but only seemed to have sent a letter (which did not arrive). I then received their follow up letter at which point they had already assessed a fee for each 'late' toll payment.

\- Since they know who I am and since they have my account details as well as auto replenishment enabled, there is NO reason why they could not simply have charged my card on file. They know who I am, they photographed my license plate AND have my credit card on file.

\- Instead, they expect **me** to know that their equipment failed and that I owe them money, which I I had no way of knowing.

\- Now I am expected to pay a fine, when they could have resolved this issue by themselves and fully automatically.

What is the point of even having EZ Pass when this sort of BS happens?

I am trying to get a hold of someone at EZ Pass, but of course the hold time is 2 hours.

I am happy to pay the initial amounts as they are my responsibility.

It is **not** my responsibility to ensure that their equipment works, nor is it my fault that they are completely incapable of resolving issues like this in a logical manner when they already have all the details they need to auto charge me like they always do, for every toll fee that I have to pay when I am passing through one of their toll gates.

I will very likely refuse to pay the late fees.Looking for advice and for others who have had this happen to them.",0.5,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jgtd9z/who_else_had_this_happen_to_them_ez_pass_tag_was/,19,1jgtd9z,2025-03-21 22:26,"Call at a weird time, like as soon as they open.  Had this happen to me and they waived the fine with no pushback at all.  Dont get too worked up about it
I have also sent back an appeal and a check for the original toll amount saying that I had my tag but it didn‚Äôt read and the fee was waived.
Log onto you account and verify that your license plate is listed (and correct) on the 'Tags/Vehicles' page. Mine looks like [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/ZbpKLiI.jpeg). If it's not there, they will not automatically associate your plate with your account.
Battery may be dead. Replace the transponder.
This JUST happened to me. I have an NJ EZ pass account and we traveled through MD/DE/NJ for Christmas. All my toll for NJ and MD appear and were properly picked up. 3 months later I get a letter from DE saying I owe the toll plus a fine. And the appeal options say to attach my EZ pass statement showing the toll was paid, but it didn‚Äôt pick up? The MD transaction and the NJ transaction from the same day are on there but not the Delaware one, which should‚Äôve been sandwiched in the middle. 

I just got the letter yesterday so I‚Äôm not sure how to resolve it yet.
Do you have your tag listed on your account. I do and if the transponder does not get read they will research the plate and charge your account. I see my license plate listed on my statement when the transponder does not get picked up.
You might still need to call, but you can connect the ez pass to your license plate online and it should prompt the removal of the fine as well as avoid having this happen again in the future.¬†
Look at the log of tolls you drove through.  They will bracket your offense.   For me that worked as proof and fines forgiven
I had it happen to me in Atlantic City called ez pass and they corrected it
Ot happened to me once.  I just paid it
This happens to me because I have a prepaid account and I don't do a great job of keeping it topped off. It's easier if you get the violation from NJ EZpass bc you can just handle it online, but whenever I get a violation from a NY toll I just call them and tell them i have a NJ ez pass, I'll pay the toll but can the fine be waived - they've never told me no. Yes, I have to wait on hold for what seems like forever. It's worth it to not pay a $50 fine on top of whatever the top lis.
UPDATE: I called them and they waived the fines and just charged me the original toll fees.
Flip the notification over and there are several options, including having them cover the toll from your existing account without paying the fee. Or go online to your account and handle it that way.

I bet you could've hacked all of it in the time it took you to write the post!

And yes Ezpass does suck.
You can go on the website and put your account (tag) number in and it turns into just the toll you pay, did this many times.
This happens to my husband a few times. When we get the violation, I fill out the required info showing I have an account and they just take the toll out. I don‚Äôt pay the fine. A pain but easy to prove and fix 

Even MD I send them my NJ ezpass info and don‚Äôt have to pay the fine
Send a check for the original toll amounts and write ‚ÄúPAID IN FULL‚Äù and they will deposit the check and the whole thing disappears ‚Ä¶ take the matter into your hands
You can log on to your ez pass account. There is a way to dispute it where you put in your tag number and you only have to pay the toll. Did you try that?  I agree it's stupid because they have your account and should know it's tied to your plate.
Call them and tell them their equipment malfunctioned. Not your problem, it's theirs. Tell them you had it in the window, it always worked and it didn't work. remove the fees.  They will comply. If not tell them you're going to file a formal complaint with the NJTPA
Make sure you add your license plate to the account. I haven't carried my tag in years without issues"

Fogo de Chao in Wayne stealing credit card number!,"Warning to everyone, I left my credit card at Fogo de Chao in Wayne.

Happened to my friend at Vesuvio‚Äôs. A tragedy!
Best thing about credit cards is you can usually lock and unlock them when they‚Äôve been misplaced; rather then be immediately cancelled and sent a whole new one.
well obviously get the police involved. If you have the time call the places that the card was used and ask the companies for any footage they have in their restaurants or places. Even if you have to drive down it will be worth it. Then you have the proof. Be proactive be your own detective.
Plot twist: What if it was stolen BY management?
Since you have the locations of the fraudulent purchases, you could try going to those locations and speaking to a manager to see if they could pull footage of the person making those purchases. Then you would have something to bring back to the restaurant and/or police.
I would still file a police report because cc fraud is serious. There was a lady who worked at a local trader joes and was using someone's cc. The police came and arrested her mid shift.
If I lost/left my credit card somewhere I wouldn‚Äôt waste ONE MINUTE and I‚Äôd be running back to retrieve it.
Why would you not freeze your card the second you know you don't have it in your possession?

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre getting so many uncouth and borderline rude comments OP. That situation sucks and I hope your credit card reimburses the charges and maybe you get some justice. I would never eat at this restaurant again if this happened to me, and I would likely file a police report even if nothing came of it.
Get cops involved
The cops can most likely trace or investigate this matter. Especially with the cameras on the locations the person went to.

Get the police involved.
Why didn't you lock the card the moment you knew you didn't have it? You can only blame yourself
Not sure what you expect Reddit to do. You need to file a police report for theft. The police needs to investigate and track down the person.
Caralho!
couldn't they check the security cameras of all those stores where purchases were made?
It happened. It should not have happened, but it did. Contact your credit card issuer and cancel the card. You should have little or no liability but contact them right away. I very much doubt that this was sanctioned by Fogo de Chao; it's a rogue employee who probably took it because he/she could. I understand that you are upset, but once you have contacted your credit card issuer, then it's no longer your fight. You have been made whole.
Go to online portal and lock your card.
Write a review just stating that your CC was stolen there.  I did just that at a different restaurant and I like to think that helped with the restaurant shutting down
I'll play devils advocate in that its a bit much of an ask for someone to sit there and review 2 days worth of security footage looking for conclusive proof of someone stealing a credit card, unless that card was sitting in full view of the camera the entire time, which i doubt. If its a re-occurring problem, they will set up their own sting for it to catch who they suspect or is responsible. Hell, even if they catch someone its not like they will drag someone before the Visa Tribunal for punishment. Even with evidence of the person pocketing the card, it'd be hard for them to turn over a case to the cops for prosecution, without places the person using that card coming up with video of them in the act of doing so.

The manager knows you are covered by the credit card, and until the credit card company themselves comes asking questions, they aren't going to get in any trouble. Sure, they can play Columbo, but that isn't their job.
You‚Äôre only responsible for $50. That said, I would have called police rather than the manager.
good to know
Sounds like the manager did it. 

If credit card companies cared about this level of fraud, they could easily investigate it and identify the perpetrator(s). Enough places have cameras. 

Truth is, it‚Äôs easier and cheaper to just hold back the payments to the company that accepted the fraudulent card.
I had something similar happen to me at the Bahama Breeze in Cherry Hill. Got a bunch of random charges by the next day, so I contacted management and they gave me an attitude about it!
Is this the one at the willowbrook mall?
I'm very sorry to say this, but as a brazilian, never feel your stuff is safe in the hands of brazilians. 

It's not all brazilians but we are known for being masters at stealing, cheating and corruption. We literally call it ""the brazilian way"". 

It's not that bad for brazilians in the US, but I wouldn't keep my guard down this much and think my credit card is safe in the hands of people in a brazilian steakhouse.

This isn't to say this was your fault, it obviously wasn't. I just feel it is my duty to warn people since I was raised in brazil and know what it's like over there lol

Sorry this happened to you and hope you can figure out a solution soon üôè
go to the media as well that can help
Is it a credit card or a debit card?

Because if it's a credit card, you are making a mountain out of a mole hill. It's NOT that big of a deal. You called the bank, they canceled the card, will mail you a new one and you are NOT on the hook for those charges...

If you're worried about getting your identity stolen you can a freeze on your credit reports, which can be done online. 

Other than that, chill out.


Unless it's a debit card...then yeah, this sucks. Call the cops.
i thought they needed a pin code when someone has your physical card?
That's only if the company cooperates, which guessing by how things are going, they won't.
That‚Äôs right. This is the easiest investigation once the police get involved.
This is why I always tell my friends and family to never, ever, use a debit card anywhere but the bank. 

Ive had my credit card numbers stolen couple of times with hundreds of dollars of charges and never had an issue after reporting it. Always got the charges removed. Nowadays I try to use Apple Pay as much as possible because they cant steal a temporary number.

The beauty of it being a credit card too is that you should be able to know the exact time the card was used, so looking through the tapes to find who exactly used the cards should be very simple
Police don't have the resources and generally don't care enough to investigate small time cc fraud because OP isn't on the hook for the charges. If it's a pattern of something similar happening multiple times, they might, but it's generally pretty rare unless it seems related to some sort of crime ring/organized crime. I work in banking and have seen this hundreds of times. I've seen instances of PDs not even be willing to bother with a report for less than $1,000 in charges.

Filing a police report is typically enough for the bank to file the fraud claim and refund, but OP might not even need one for this amount. They should call their bank first to ask what they need.

OP wont really lose anything once he files the fraud dispute, but trying to investigate themselves will be a massive waste of time and energy. No one's going to let you see their camera footage unless you have a badge and even if they walk away with rock solid evidence of the perp, odds are a coin flip the PD would even bother to pursue.
Me too ü§£
Well OP did nothing to help themselves, you can pause cards you don't even have to cancel them. Literally if you are unsure where your card is pause the thing. The fraud isn't their fault but not taking action made it worse.
True or False?  OP lost credit card at restaurant.
Nah, doubt the cops do anything. But still good to file a report incase the credit card company wants it
The cops COULD do something, but they probably won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre too busy playing candy crush and protecting private property.
I lock my card when I misplace it in the house. Amex and Chase will overnight another card and let me use Apple Pay in the meantime.
Jk it‚Äôs a sports apparel store?
It's the company that bought Finishline. They're EU based.
He could have but people leave ccs at restaurants ALL THE TIME. I bet less than 25% lock it when they do.
He's not expecting Reddit to do anything about it! He's warning people about that business and its staff.
They could, but they are not going to.
Why would they check for OP?  It doesn't matter.  The credit card is the property of whatever bank of financial company or whatever entity issued it.  

OP should have called and reported the card lost the second he got off the phone with the restaurant because that's when OP's zero liability protection would have kicked in ... except OP wanted to play Dick Detective instead of calling.

OP has no authority to demand to see security cameras.  I don't know what ""revenge"" they think they will get.  It's up to the card issuer or one of the businesses who might be affected if they want to pursue this.
I‚Äôm not making big deal. I‚Äôm warning others so they same thing doesn‚Äôt happen to them
He said credit card. Not debit card.
I‚Äôve never needed a pin when swiping my card anywhere.
That's for a debit card
Bro, what pin? Are you European or are you one of them weirdos that uses a debit card and thinks it's the same as a credit card?
When our cards were stolen someone tried using them at a bodega. The cameras were good enough to zoom in on the cards in the person‚Äôs hands, and the person was arrested. The points the card was used matter, not the restaurant.¬†
A restaurant can‚Äôt simply turn away the police.
Yep, it's a lot easier to get credit reversed than to get money back in your bank account
Apple Pay is truly a godsend. I use it everywhere because it has become the safest way to charge.
You could call them in 2 months if that's when you found out
In this household, Artie Bucco is a warm and convivial host, end of story!!
Sometimes people aren‚Äôt aware of the options they have, so I hope OP has at least learned this feature.
In this case I want revenge so I‚Äôm going to do all of that
You‚Äôre paying a $500 annual fee on a credit card? L**M**AO.
seriously haha.  so much garbage advice in this sub again as usual
bro literally has the credit card app open so he knows it can lock the card
True. Without reading the post the title makes it seem like the establishment is stealing numbers
every single cc place does this in 2025

op is wasting a ton of time when all they had to do was place a call and answer a couple questions
Capital one and TD as well.
Yeah Ive had a restaurant hold my card for like 2 days when I forgot it before, no issues.
That's no excuse, this isn't the world our parents and their parents lived in that you could trust people. Leave your doors unlocked let alone a credit card. 

OP should have locked the card the moment he knew it was missing or the moment he got verification it was at the bar. It's their own fault for being naive.
Thanks for having common sense and explaining it to those who don‚Äôt
OP should have locked his credit card as soon as he found out he left his credit card at the bar.  OP left his credit card unlocked for TWO FULL days.  Yes I blame the management for not hiring people with integrity, but I also blame OP for being so reckless.
Best post in thread, and spot on. Once the fraudulent charges are removed their statement, OP should move on. Also LOL at people telling OP to call the police, who in turn will tell them to call the credit card company.
They could easily steal the card number or clone it if the restaurant doesn‚Äôt use table side credit card machines.
Or you could just be more mindful and not leave your cc somewhere‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt blame the business. It was most likely an employee, and not the company. Call the cc company and they will handle it I‚Äôm sure.
Even with a debit card, I can just hit ‚Äúenter‚Äù on the keypad to bypass my PIN.
Without a warrant, they can
They certainly can, businesses have rights just like people and some restaurants don't want police presence around. The police would need to get a warrant and I'm not sure they would want to go through that effort.
Dress like Batman when you do this.
How are you going to get revenge? No one is going to give you access to surveillance footage at any of those places. Even CC investigators in many cases aren't able to get the footage and they are former FBI/detectives that know how to scare the shit out of minimum wage employees.
Then go back and raise hell. If they call the cops file a report for stealing your CC info. Embrace the chaos
If you travel a lot, you‚Äôre likely spending at least that much on stuff like Global Entry, clubs, drinks on the plane, etc. Those fees are entirely made up for with free stuff, rebates and memberships that you might be paying for anyway. When I travelled a lot more for work, I had all those cards and always made out with more in benefits than the annual fees. Now, I have one hotel card to keep platinum status and even with the $100 fee or whatever, I get two free hotel nights each year which is worth more than the fee.
One of my annual fees is $695.   I get $15 in Uber credit every month, Gold status with Hilton Honors and Marriott Bonvoy, Walmart membership is paid for entirely, Global entry credit, extended warranties, $20 digital credit every month, Amex global lounge access ... 

Depending on where you are in life, it can defintely be worth it.
The annual fee is actually 550 on my chase sapphire reserve which is one of the most popular credit cards around, for good reason IMO.
not the broke guy confidently laughing about finances he doesn't understand LMAO

you easily recoup this within a couple months based on all the perks from just using it you dunce

stick to r/povertyfinance with stupid advice like this
i don't even have to make a call. it's a two second thing on every cc website now. i am a huge credit card slut, sticking it anywhere I can because I know I'm not liable for fraud.
Should he have locked it‚Ä¶yea he should have. But cmon‚Ä¶his fault for being naive? Take it easy there 20/20 hindsight Harry.
Thanks - I tried! It didn't seem to sink in though. lol
Right - agreed.

But you asked ""What do you expect Reddit to do?"", which isn't the question. And it wasn't what OP was getting at. OP was warning people about the staff and management, that's all - there was no need for the snark.
You can absolutely blame the business for being rude and handling it the way that they did. The manager is a representative of that business. 

OP is already in contact with their bank/CC company. They‚Äôre just letting people know that this happened.
sometimes you can get a cop in the city or town to go with you to the place it occurred to get access to the information.  especially if it happens to be inside a mall one of the places.  Yes you can rely on the credit card to do something. I had lifelock and still had to chase things down for them.
[deleted]
Yeah that response is kinda crazy. Obviously in hindsight he should‚Äôve locked it, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy to assume a big popular business wouldn‚Äôt just let your credit card get stolen. 

People need to learn some charity on this site.
Literally‚Ä¶
The first mistake was going to Fogo instead of a real Rodizio place like Fernandes or some of those ironbound spots. Mmmmm.
Op will not have to do any chasing down.  This is not identity theft, OP left their physical card behind, did not report it as lost to the issuer when they realized this and the card was taken and used.  

Also, OP is not a crime victim, OP's CC company and the merchants are the victims.
I meant how OP was going to get revenge by driving down to the places where the credit card was used and trying to talk to the staff there like the person I responded to was suggesting. Obviously you can call the cops.

They're mandatory in all new cars, so I don't see how they could possibly not be allowed.
It should be allowed since it's a safety mechanism in the car but it is important I think to be able to use both the camera and the mirror and use them both together to show the instructor a competence for both.  Not all cars have the camera and cameras are prone to failing which means you need to resort to the mirror and need to show proficiency in both.

Can't speak to that specific house, but that's just the market. People are putting bids on 15-25% over asking to even have a shot at it being accepted by the seller. Especially with investors coming in and buying with all cash offers.

The market was the same 2 years ago when my wife and I bought, and has been that way since covid basically. I know we paid around 15-20% over asking to beat someone with a cash offer.

And that's all even more true for nice neighborhoods and well kept up homes.

Edit: spelling
Its near a train station in Monmouth County.
Little silver schools are some of the best in the state. Maybe not red bank regional high school, but markham is top 10 and point road is top 40.

Edit: it's also one of the highest income towns as well. Add in the proximity to Red Bank downtown, ferries, GSP, trains, and beaches and it's a great town with lots to offer.
It's NJ, and a wealthy area.  Of course it's going to sell above ask.
People be rich
Because real estate prices in New Jersey are INSANELY overinflated.  Houses that on a good day should be worth $300,000 are going for half a million or more.
There‚Äôs legit no inventory in Jersey. And no much land left either. Most lands protected that‚Äôs empty. 

We looked at a $550k home in our budget and it sold for 690. We have been priced out do to bidding wars and interest rates. Landlords love this shit
Lack of inventory
Why does anything sell over a suggested price?
Its normal now for houses to intentionally list well under what they will go for. It attracts attention and gets a lot of bids in. Its also what folks would consider the floor for an all cash, everything waived offer.
Welcome to New Jersey
Beats me but last Sunday in Nutley I passed a crappy looking house for sale and there was a long line out the door.
So, in certain places there are people that concentrate on buying multiple properties in the same area.  
  
They do some house fixups. Then they rent out the houses at around $3k a month.  
  
They keep everything in an area so resources, the connections they have with the town's leadership, and the local pull they have all get stronger.
Because that‚Äôs what stuff is selling for
I've been outbid by literal companies offering 100k over asking. Maybe something similar?
Over bidding has been a thing for a while now around this state
Easy, certain areas have bidding wars so people will offer over asking to get their offer accepted. I see it happening all the time in my town, Glen Rock.

Can I see the house layout.. any pics?

Housing shortage. When you don‚Äôt build enough housing, and make it exceedingly difficult to build any at all, this is what happens.
ooof cash sale too‚Ä¶ I mean I get the upgrades have value but not *that* much
none of these school districts itt are ""best in nj""
I'm in an industry that gets the first call when someone is selling a house. We ask, and we keep records.


I will say this...


The market is softening. The past 4 years we got next to zero calls from sellers. This spring they're everywhere.


The reason? Boomers have cash and they want out. They are tired of wasting their retirement year waiting for the market to let up so they can buy their dream home down south or somewhere else.


They would rather cough up the cash than wait around to mortgage a property. Quite honestly, they have more cash built up to buy in other states, and therefore hold the purchasing power.
Not for nothing, if you are putting an offer in for a house that‚Äôs 1.3 mil, offering an extra 325k is absolutely irrelevant. But as others said, 25% over asking is a bit of the norm now.

How do you know that it‚Äôs cash sale?

Because Red Bank also feeds into RBR. Red Bank enrollment of Hispanic children is about 80%.  No issue with ethnicity but the kids are likely first generation from non English speaking parents who don't earn as much as parents from little silver or Shrewsbury (the other town that feeds into RBR), so the kids don't do as well on testing.

Edit: with the money issue, Red Bank is underfunded and lots of the children qualify for free school lunch. The state performance reports can really shed light on this. You'll see the biggest difference in performance in the economically disadvantaged vs non-economically disadvantaged within red bank itself and even bigger difference when compared to Little Silver.

The fact is children from wealthier families perform better than those from poorer families. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of bright kids from poorer families, but overall this trend is true.

current processing time is 4-6 weeks non-expedited.
That‚Äôs what it *can* take if you don‚Äôt have other documents or ways to prove identity, and obviously they want to warn and scare you not to do it. I saw a reports here that someone who forgot ID and went straight to secondary got out faster than their partner who was in line.

24k for central air + ducting install,"Sorry first time homeowner- Does this quote seems reasonable?

Get 3 estimates and compare.

Honestly wouldn't hazard to guess. I feel like no company is installing or maintaining ductwork anymore, they just put in mini splits.
Yep, that sounds right for a smaller house with two condensers; one for each floor.
I'd go silver
get two to three more quotes and then you'll know.
That's crazy.¬† But I would get other estimates.¬† Typically , it costs $20k to replace the HVAC altogether.¬† ¬†
Get multiple quotes.
You should probably give us all the project details that you gave the people who made this quote.
We installed a brand new system last year for around $30k. Brand new as in the house didn‚Äôt even have any ductwork, so we were literally starting from scratch. As others have said there are tons of variables by location, system type, etc. so make sure you get multiple quotes
Sounds about right depending on specifics.  Curious about the ductwork though, you‚Äôre saying you have ductwork but it needs to be replaced?
I replaced my old system with 3.5 ton Lenox for 15k. No duct work. So that‚Äôs seems reasonable
Depends on a million things. A good condensor and compressor will run you around 8k on its own, and that assumes they can drop it into your existing setup. 

If your house wasn't built for central, or your ductwork is 50 years old, yeah, they will need to change some stuff if you want it to work right. Every house is going to be different in what it takes though, and then there are various levels of how they do it (how hidden is it, how much closet space do you need to lose for new ducts, where they run them, and then any remediation to the work after it).

One house might need a few pieces of sheet metal in the basement, another might mean ripping open random walls all throughout the house.

As others have pointed out, there are advantages to minisplits as well and the tax credits you can get on them really sweetens the deal. 

But again, all depends on the house and what you are going for.
I got central air last summer in my two floor house and it was $11k
Reasonable.  Was in the field for 14 years and now in HVAC sales.  Have to think of it as a long term investment.
Seems high but it's gotten expensive.

Believe it or not I got the best price and deal through costco.
I got new AC and heat for half that. But that is going back about 7 years now‚Ä¶
Right? It‚Äôs like asking ‚ÄúThis guy wants $15k for a car. Is it a rip off?‚Äù
Totally depends on the system.  El cheapo system then it's a bit high but a ultra efficient system then that sounds about right.
If I had it to do again I would've torn out the forced air system and gotten mini splits everywhere.
And yet these fucking leeches quote you around the same for a mini split install. Labor rates are heinous now.
Polished copper looks pretty good.
So I‚Äôm in a similar boat- 24k doesn‚Äôt sound unreasonable. I‚Äôm waiting on a second quote that‚Äôs taking way too long to get to me and considering getting a 3rd quote but thanks for sharing!
I have no ductwork at all- so need all new ductwork and vents put in
Thanks! Hearing this is helpful. Such a huge amount of money that I keep psyching myself out
Who did you use?
Not worth more than 10K at best. AT BEST
You just have to shop around. My house has a mini split system only for the upstairs and I was quoted $18k recently to replace the condenser and heads. Wound up paying far less than that after getting another quote
Oh ok yeah my house was similar, no existing ductwork, one zone, 2 stage system.  Was about 20k in 2021 I think
Edison heating and cooling
Seems like it gets a little more expensive every year. But thanks for sharing- this is super helpful!
Word - did you also get ducts put in or did you already have the ductwork?
I had the ducts already
Ahh that‚Äôll do it- I don‚Äôt have anything
I mean you could also go for wall mounted units as well they also do heat and AC with the actual heart of the system outside
Have you considered a mini split system?
I have a broken mini split and home warranty on them has been a 2 month nightmare. Wife and I both decided we want central air even if it‚Äôs more expensive and that it‚Äôll be the once a year big upgrade."

other flowers you can find in NJ & make simple syrup from for use in cocktails & baking: violets, butterfly pea flower, lilac, jasmine, dandelion, and honeysuckle

Fulop,"If you are looking for a progressive alternative to the traditional democrats and MAGA Republicans I would recommend checking out Steve Fulop.  I posted his website so you can read his policies and make your own informed decision. 

On a personal note I appreciate that when you open the web page it gives you options to volunteer instead of just asking for money.

",0.6,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jgkxqw/fulop/,84,1jgkxqw,2025-03-21 16:29,"To all the people saying this is splitting the vote please rally around and vote for the democrat who wins the primary. However, before primaries end please look at all candidates and choose the one you align with most. That‚Äôs how grassroots organizing works.
Hi hi hi.. Fulop comes across very well, same tactic used in jersey city. I loved him when he was first elected‚Ä¶even worked in his office. Unfortunately, my view of him declined‚Äîonce it became clear that he wanted the governor seat his concern/leadership for Jersey City went downhill. 

He became increasingly concerned about optics and less concerned about really making the city better for all residents. I have no doubts he will do the same down in trenton. Gov seat is just a stop on a much larger agenda for him. 

I love Baraka but I hear newark residents are singing a different tune‚ÄîI‚Äôm listening to them, how folks act on the local level is indicative of how they are going to be at a higher level. 

Pros under Fulop in jersey city:
- Increased pedestrian safety (this just means we have bike lanes, traffic laws are still not enforced and the only roadways safe for bikes are the protected ones. We have a couple)

-Development boom (lots of development, the planning department basically approved all heights /variances so now we have ‚Äúluxury‚Äù buildings jammed in every which space you can imagine‚Äîso yeah over development in such a short amount of time)

-VIA (Jersey city has its own intercity transit VIA service, I‚Äôve never used it but I hear good things about it )

-Pedestrian Plaza (Our downtown area is definitely more of a downtown type of area these days, definitely was built up under Fulop)


Cons under Fulop
-Crime stats ( One of the projects I worked on was the data portal..we spent a lot of time and energy trying to collect as much data as possible and display it for the public, calls for service was one the data points, along with shots fired. Initially we included that, but somewhere along the way that got dropped‚Äîwe currently have no way as the public to view crime stats‚ÄîFulop quietly put an end to that.)

- Quality of life task force (we had one of Fulop‚Äôs buddies in this position, never really understood how it helped the community but functioned more like a placeholder for whoever was Fulop‚Äôs buddy at the time

-City Council‚Äîwe have a 9 member council, one of them actually hit a bicyclist (Amy Degise) charges filed and all‚ÄîFulop stayed quiet oh her dad is/was Hudson County Executive‚Äîso that‚Äôs probably why. Anyway Fulop controls majority of the council with just about 2 dissenting voices each time so typically his agenda is always approved. Not sure if this is actually a con or it a just because he‚Äôs politician lol 

-Rents/affordable housing ‚Äîhe couldn‚Äôt properly address it on the local level, I have doubts it will be addressed on the state level. Turns out building affordable housing is expensive and so far no politicians has the guts to enforce developers to add more affordable units nor have I seen any creative solutions. During my time there we started the conversation, but it quickly fizzled. 



Hopefully this helps folks start to  take a deeper look at all candidates, I get no one is perfect,but giving the way things are right now we ought to be a bit more selective.
It‚Äôs Baraka for me!
He had my brain at his transportation policy standpoints, he had my heart when he said he‚Äôd keep Platkin as attorney general
Fulop is part of the democratic machinery, disguised as a faux progressive. 

Come on, you don‚Äôt become and stay mayor of Jersey City without paying fealty to the Hudson County machinery.  So what, he bucked the machinery once or twice, but he was made and propped up by the hudson county insiders.
Nah I'm good
Nah I‚Äôm good.
This butthead opened the door of Jersey City wide open to Kushner and Trump alike. He‚Äôs just in politics to enrich himself and his friends while raising property taxes on everyone else. Stay away from this liar.
Nope
Can‚Äôt run a city, how will be manage to run a state?
No thanks. Mikie it is!
Only candidate prioritizing transit, and has good knowledge of policy. If he can deliver, I'm in
Fulop is the best chance we got to stick it to the establishment. Just look at how Jersey City became significantly better than when Healy was running shit. Lived there for 13 years and voted for Fulop 3 times. Literally transformed the city in a pedestrian, bike, and Transit positive way. The haters weren't there beforehand and are angry about rent which is just NYC spilling over and nothing to do with Fulop. Definitely voting Fulop in the primary, if he loses going Ciattarelli  because fuck it can't beat em join em.
You will lose moderate independents and republicans if Fulop is the candidate. Sherrill wins in a lot of red districts
üòÇ Fulop isn't progressive! He fucking flipflopped with the IHRA bill. He initially stated he supported the bill, and then when he was challenged at a meet and greet, he switched it up. 

As someone else said Democrats are just Republicans in a trenchcoat.
I lashed out at your last post, but two things are true.

1. If you‚Äôre working for the Fulop campaign, please let us know. We can look into his policies and statements, but please be truthful in your intentions

2. Appreciated the coalescing after the fact if Fulop doesn‚Äôt prevail, no need to infight once it‚Äôs over
I live in JC and agree with you 1000%. 

People won‚Äôt listen to JC residents who are sharing their negative experience of him as mayor - especially in the last 3 years or so. 

He‚Äôs running a campaign where he will say whatever you want to hear to get votes. We already fell for it in JC - don‚Äôt let it happen statewide.

Honestly the pros you listed have a lot of negatives as well. Pedestrian safety has significantly declined recently. VIA is not reliable and a waste of taxpayer money. And I personally think the city has failed to scale services (police, DPW, etc) with the amount of development that‚Äôs occurred. Also I avoid the pedestrian plaza at all costs now - nothing is enforced there and many of the businesses will share their gripes with the mayor because of it.
>economy, crime, all being handled mistakenly. 

Violent crime is the lowest since 1960 dawg. The recent cop death shook our city to our core because we're not used to violence like that anymore. 

We had only 37 homicides in 2024. 10 years ago we'd regularly be in the hundreds. 

Baraka is limited in his power as Mayor. The Governor has the power to fulfill Abbott v Burke which calls for 50 new schools to be built in the City.

It's a nj supreme court case from 1990. Because most governors cater to the suburbs, only 7 schools were built, and those are the highest performing schools in the city.

Transportation is fucking awful in jersey city
As opposed to Gottheimer??? Who's literally a republican in a Democrat suit?? FOH
It seems like you mean: being successful means you must be an insider. It seems like circular reasoning IMO ; every gubernatorial candidate will have a had some level of success.

I feel like ""progressive"" is just a dog whistle for ""anti-establishment""
So who‚Äôs the choice?
No‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not. In fact he pissed a LOT of people off by going against the Machine. Sherrill is who the powerbrokers are backing. Fulop is going full grass roots.
Josh Kushner is not Jared Kushner, has no ties to Trump, and runs a completely separate development business than his brother. Maybe do some research.
he‚Äôs awful. people will believe anything they‚Äôre told. this guy is as crooked as they come. Has put his campaign above the needs of JC and at the expense of public safety.
Mikie took SpaceX money. Hard pass
‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt beat them join them‚Äù mentality does not work for reforming the party. Please read my first comment on this post about rallying behind whoever receives the nomination.
This reads like the people who say if not Bernie then Trump. Do you see what Trump is doing to our federal government? Are you okay with that? Because that‚Äôs what they want to do at the state level too. 

If you are, you might as well just say you‚Äôre voting for Ciattarelli from the start. I‚Äôm all for voting with your heart for the primary, but to say you‚Äôll vote Republican if the nom isn‚Äôt your guy‚Ä¶.thats very scary and that‚Äôs how NJ will go red.
What JC do you live in because being a pedestrian, biker, or taking transit here is awful. And I live downtown. Crossing the street is like playing frogger every day because Fulop won‚Äôt hold his police department accountable for enforcing laws.
Republicans don't vote for democrats so that's not an issue
Thank you for your comment.

1) I am not working for the campaign. I am just a NJ resident who likes his policies, and I think he has a realistic chance of winning against a republican candidate. 

2) No problem. We are all in this together, and I thought it was implied that we need to stick together until I read comments and noticed some confusion.
Just a quick fyi. You didn‚Äôt lash out at me before this is my first political post.
You aren‚Äôt wrong, I didn‚Äôt want my post to be super negative but the poor response time for emergency services is abysmal..for the second largest city in the state, we should be scaled to accommodate that and he‚Äôs had several years to do so‚Ä¶.after the first term he completely checked out.
Baraka cut the murder rate of Newark in half, since he took over from Booker ten years ago. That alone is astounding.
I think you quoted the wrong person?
Dude, did you ever visit Newark 15 years ago?
It's the only place with actual transit though, so that's not saying much. No where else in the state has a walkable commute to a train station, protected bike lanes, an alternative transport (light rail). Of course there could be improvements, but I doubt a JC mayor could for instance expand tunnels under NYC to accommodate path trains
He‚Äôll say he has experience with public transit. The reality is privatized van service that takes 40 minutes to show up. When we could have better bus service instead.
There is Sean Spiller, for what it's worth
Baraka, imo.
A true progressive would be anyone without a D or R in front of their name. The establishment parties are all Party First, people last.
I was born and raised here. He tried raising the property tax to push people out so greedy rich people can move in but the people fought back and he relented. He wasn‚Äôt good for Jersey City and won‚Äôt be good for New Jersey
Maybe you should provide some evidence (data, articles, something) so that you might have a chance at convincing anyone.

If the last election has taught us anything, when Democrats try to appeal to Republicans and Independents with centrist policies, you're not giving them a real choice, so they just vote Republican anyway. Democrats have to have unique policies, and explain why those policies are better.
I don‚Äôt work for Fulop, but I really like him. I‚Äôve been to a couple of his meet and greets and I also attended the debate with all six candidates at Rider University. Baraka is fun to listen to but Fulop is strong across the board.  He‚Äôs so detailed it‚Äôs sick. He seems to be more knowledgeable than anyone else and has a really good grasp of the issues and has some really good ideas. I like that he‚Äôs not afraid to be different or say something different. He‚Äôs not afraid to skip the conventions. He wasn‚Äôt afraid to talk about congestion pricing being a good thing. He sometimes thinks outside of the box which can be an effective way to problem solve.  He‚Äôs really good.  You should definitely check him out.  He always says I‚Äôm not asking you to vote for me. I‚Äôm asking you to look at all the candidates objectively. Check out all of their websites and compare.
Og person deleted their comment and I didn't want to waste my comment

Agree on that but the only thing he worked on on that list is the bike lanes. During his tenure as mayor the development has completely broken the path, busses and the lightrail is wildly inconsistent.
I went to the panel the other day in Westwood hoping to hear from him and he dropped out last minute. Fulop showed though and I was impressed.  

I‚Äôm not saying I have an answer. I‚Äôm not going to vote for the authoritarian party. It was just refreshing to hear actual progressive ideas and a fleshed out plan.
So who is your true progressive candidate for the 2025 New Jersey Gubernatorial Election?
Great idea, let‚Äôs split up the vote so a Republican can win, good thinking.
Lies, he didn't try to raise the property taxes, the BOE and city council did behind his back. You're one of those people who can't see the forest through the trees and can't see that all the improvements he made to downtown JC have a butterfly effect through the rest of the city.
We can start with the majority of the city council voting no confidence in Fulops public safety director because of increasing crime and complete lack of enforcement across the city. That happened last week.
Nope. But it is disqualifying.
Exactly, parties need to stop catering to people who weren't going to vote for them anyway!
Eh, if you mean the 2024 presidential election, I'm not sure I buy that. It seems a lot like ""Harry Potter fan group says Harris didn't provide enough vocal  support for gryffindor"". 

Probably Harris lost because she had 3 months, and the economic situation around inflation was fresh in people's minds.
The last election has actually told us that progressives don't win elections. Thats why they are at a net loss of 3 seats and moderate dems are at a net gain of 15 seats.
Oh hell yeah thats okay!
I go more often than I used to and it has its problems but the improvement I‚Äôve seen is dramatic since 2009. 

There is a lot to be done.
Sure, but the PATH, busses, and lightrail are explicitly not owned by JC or Hoboken, and not under the direction of the mayor ; Bike paths and bike sharing (also implemented by Fulop) are. 

[NJ overall has about 2 pedestrian deaths a day](https://www.nj.com/news/2024/12/njs-traffic-deaths-surge-in-2024-with-spike-in-pedestrian-fatalities.html). I'll take the win of a bike path/bike sharing, support for congestion pricing (which directly makes JC air cleaner), and not expanding highways. Looking at his policies on transportation, they include a [dedicating funding stream for NJT and PATH](https://stevenfulop.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Fulop2025-TransportationWP-R6-Web.pdf), which I view as a win.
I'm very much with you on that (and I'm not against Fulop)! It's feeling actually a bit refreshing, this year, that I'm thinking about who I like more, rather than who I dislike the least.
NJ has had 8 years of Murphy which has been mediocre at best. GOP has an advantage this cycle. Fulop as the democratic nominee would be a huge mistake.
There are two declared candidates so far. Go research and see which one best works for you.
This is for the primary.
That mentality is the reason why we‚Äôre in this mess because everyone shouted ‚ÄúVote Blue No Matter Who‚Äù  in 2024‚Ä¶and we ended up with duplicitous Democratic senators with no backbone to stop Trump.
Lol
I agree again but my point is that while he brings up transit and finding he also is in the pocket of developers who have completely overwhelmed the infrastructure of the city. So while that all looks good on paper, the situation is getting worse daily. Try waiting for a bus on west side. Walk down the streets and smell the 100+ year old sewer system overloaded with a massive amount of extra turds. Try to rent an apartment in one of those walkable commutable areas for a reasonable rate for some place that isn‚Äôt run by a crooked landlord. The city has gotten worse since fulop becane mayor but the buildings and the pedestrian plaza and bike lanes are pretty.
From the information I have right now. I don‚Äôt think so. 

He‚Äôs pushing a progressive platform and we‚Äôre watching people all over the country fill seats to hear Bernie and AOC and confronting their own reps. Cittarelli was running on Trump‚Äôs platform last time and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs distanced himself all that much now. 

I think someone like Sherrill could win, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be because she is offering anything more impressive than what Murphy has been doing.
Buddy, if you can't even name names, no one is going to take your advice.
I‚Äôm asking you though. You‚Äôre offering a problem an idea of a solution, but I‚Äôd like to see if you have a concrete one
Then say who you'd prefer so we can research them. Seems like the only one trying to split votes is you. I'd you're going to make such claims, you're fully expected to back them up.
The stay home progressives that refused to vote for Harris gave us Trump.
It's actually far more complex, and simple, than that. Red voters are far more collectivist. Not even a question. It's almost always going to be THAT battle. Those not Red tend to have higher and more passionate varieties of leanings and viewpoints, from deeply centrist, to moderate, all the way to the farthest left. The issue is that not only are we not as collectivist as we all should be - the biggest issue - , but we're not taking proper baby steps into leaning further into progressivism, together. In fact, we're fighting internally more than we all should. 

You cannot possibly be voting for a third party and expect people to 1. Vote with you, considering what I stated above and 2. See a meager 1% uptick and think ""Wow, third party has a shot so we should start going that direction"" when the nominee you DONT want is easily going to gain at least 40%. You are, effectively, shooting yourself in the foot and others with you. It's simply the current reality. 2.13% voted a third party in the 2024 Presidential Election. That's it. If you want new party viability, start far more locally.
> Try to rent an apartment in one of those walkable commutable areas for a reasonable rate for some place that isn‚Äôt run by a crooked landlord

The population of NJ is growing quickly, and building more housing is a plus to me. The flip side of ""being in the pocket of developers"" is NJ towns suing to stop affordable housing. JC has unreasonable rents and strained infrastructure because... people want to live there, people have money, and NJ allows rent to be raised by any ""reasonable"" amount. The answer to all of these issues is to build more housing (in most candidates plans), build more infrastructure (Biden gave our state about 12 billion dollars), and to get better transit (only in Fulop's plan TMK). 

Bike lanes aren't just ""pretty"", they are an affordable way to provide to prevent car traffic without expensive maintenance on new public transit (micro-transit). It's important that some of the people of a 30+ story high rise can walk, some can ride a bike/scooter, and some can drive depending on their needs. That mixed transportation aids in building denser housing, because car reliance detracts from denser housing (parking lots, more traffic, more noise, impossible to expand roads, etc.). To be honest, if you don't like these things, move to anywhere else in NJ where they have no sidewalks or bike lanes, and check how easy it is to catch a bus, how great the infrastructure is, or how cheap the rent is ; I think you'll be surprised.

&nbsp;

> The city has gotten worse since fulop becane mayor but the buildings and the pedestrian plaza and bike lanes are pretty

I've lived in JC during his tenure; I can't compare to previous admins, but most of my complaints were around the BOE raising property taxes. The strain you're referencing is felt across NJ, not just in JC, due to our population growth (check the high rises in Bergen county and their strain on traffic, or lawsuits over affordable housing)
Don‚Äôt take the advice. But it remains fact, Fulop is a fake progressive.
This has been shown time and time again to be false, 16/20/24 but why do you think it's more important to blame ""stay at home progressives"" than the party with power.
No. It was the Democratic Party who failed to win more votes than Trump, that gave the election to Trump.
Why should anyone listen to you?
If all registered Dems voted for Harris, she would be president and we would now have the luxury of building a stronger grassroots progressive party instead of having our constitution dismantled by Trump.
Agreed. If we maintain a stronger collective, it allows more opportunity for progressive growth. Hoping this comes forth in the Gubernatorial elections.
Then Harris shud have done a better job getting out the vote.
Ok so we don‚Äôt get behind whoever wins the Dem primary and we have a Republican governor at the worst possible time in history, and that will be our fault."

Honestly this looks bad for Fulop. I was hearing good things about him but having his supporters go out and bash other Democrats, it's just slimy and not needed.

It's funny when the other side is taking money from the wrong people It's bad, but when your side does it then it's OK and you are a shill for the other side when you point it out. This applies to the left and right.
I cant believe this spook was ever taken seriously in NJ. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkland_%26_Ellis

Besides military spook sent from VA to secure her seat, the law firm she worked for was the first in the world to become a billion dollar law firm. View the heinous client list, and you'll see why. There's far worse somehow than space x on that list, but palentir backed Harris for the election and just terrorized NJ with drones under Biden, so nothing surprises me anymore. 

I don't know anything about the other candidate. But as someone who's representative never gave a fuck about NJ and only served VA/DC too (smith), it's really annoying anyone can carpet bag their way in and out constantly from the MIC.
Well, it was just announced today that Mikie‚Äôs giving the Musk $$$ to a charity. She finally grew spine. Now all her supporters can finally relax and stop making your idiotic excuses for her. Y‚Äôall were really out here acting like taking money from Musk was NBD.  Bunch of clowns! ü§£ü§£ü§£
Can you flair somebody else?
Are you working for Mikie? Why else would you be out here acting like taking money from Musk is NBD?
Same. Take his money then stiff him.
Given their username, I suspect they might be Fulop himself. The guy is a bit of a creep.¬†


Edit: After a dive through their history, I no longer think they're Fulop himself (assuming they're telling the truth about some things) but they're definitely associated with his campaign, probably quite high up. They've been trying to spread distrust among current democrats for a while.¬†
Either way, nothing wrong with

It's a SpaceX employee pac and it has nothing to do with musk, the poster knows this. They have an agenda to push.
Mikie is totally uninspiring. She‚Äôs literally the worst one.  She can‚Äôt debate.
I‚Äôd try to get money from Koch brothers, muskrat, and other evil asshole billionaires. Then I‚Äôd work hard against them. Bait and switch. Give them their own medicine. Dems lose because we always have to purity test each and every donation. Screw it. Take the money and run (for office) with it. If you have no intention of quid pro quo, it‚Äôs all good.
It‚Äôs funny you sound just like a Sherrill staffer. In fact you just said you worked on campaigns!  Maybe, just maybe, your boss (Mikie) isn‚Äôt that good?
Correct. Sherrill supporters out here acting like taking money from Musk is NBD. Either way she‚Äôs giving it back to charity.  At least she realizes it was wrong.
She also took a million in exchange for a Bloomberg 2020 primary run lol but yeah I‚Äôm sure the gunship pilot surely has strong moral convictions
Tell me you don‚Äôt understand how law careers work without telling me how law careers work
mods can
Wait why is Fulop a creep? (Asking genuinely.)
Get over yourself. How much is Mikie paying you? Even Mikie knows it‚Äôs wrong to have Musk‚Äòs money. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs giving it back. ü§£
He openly supported and voted for Biden and told Trump in 2022 he should, hang up his hat and ride into the sunset. Also went after Trump when he quit the Paris accord. Don‚Äôt make me defend the douche, just be honest¬†
Primary opponents getting testy
She won a red district. I'm not sure what you mean by uninspiring. That's as inspiring as it gets lol. We need a lot more of those people on our team, not people that will just move more people to the right.
I do have a couple friends who are Mikie staffers (and also one who works for Fulop.) I don‚Äôt do that work anymore. I was tired of being broke lol
We're talking to people who think Goldman Sachs bankers who don't hate gays is ""progressive"" and then wonder why their lives never improve. It's fascinating from outside my home state watching what dems just did to you all with Peter thiels drones, and then watching the state beg for some more of the same. Good luck
I do. And I'm on the opposite side of the MIC, big tobacco, nazi company volkswagen, billionaires, child slavers Nike, Jeffrey epstein, Boeing, and BP oil spill thanks. Sorry you, your candidate, and party are not.
I support Fulop and he isn‚Äôt creepy at all. He‚Äôs a nice guy. He‚Äôs not participating in the conventions because they‚Äôre corrupt AF. The candidates participating are part of the problem.  Educate yourself.
Partially it's the vibe people I know have gotten from him. Partially it's because he's been showing up at county conventions (and I heard he showed up at another candidate's event but I don't know which one or where) and has been lurking outside. People he approached said it was really creepy and offputting.¬†
Nice one. If I was getting paid by Mikie, I wouldn't keep saying I can't decide between her and Baraka.¬†
I was referring to his numerous sexual harassment allegations. He may have only recently gone ""MAGA crazy"" but he's been a piece of shit publicly for a lot longer than that.
What I mean is when you watch the debates and see all the candidates next to each other there‚Äôs nothing about her that stands out. She dodges questions. Fulop is detailed and Baraka is charismatic and she‚Äôs neither. I would prefer either one of those two over her.
What I see is a whole bunch of Mikie people just showed up pretending like they‚Äôre not paid. You know damn well she‚Äôs not the strongest candidate. Not even in the top 3. She can‚Äôt even answer a direct question. Is that what you really want for your state?  Do you guys even live in NJ?

It‚Äôs like when some Spiller volunteers knocked on my door. They admitted they were getting paid and didn‚Äôt even like him. I feel like it‚Äôs the same thing with these Sherrill supporters.
You really don‚Äôt lmao

Lawyers who graduate from top law schools go to big law to make money. Kirkland and Ellis is a big law firm where top law students from top law schools go to make money

Hope that helps!

Edit: OP blocked me. Just so you guys know, this is a bad faith purity test for candidates. Biglaw attracts the top law students in the country to grind for them, charge their clients thousands of dollars per hour for their work product but pay the newly minted associates like $300k (in todays dollars). Most of them do it for like 3-5 years before burning out or taking jobs with more prestige or taking jobs with better work life balance
Wtf? I like Fulop as well, I‚Äôm asking in case I missed something, aka educating myself.
That‚Äôs how I know you‚Äôre not for real. Because those two don‚Äôt belong in the same sentence. I‚Äôve never seen two politicians so polar opposite as Baraka and Sherrill. And Baraka always talks sh*t about Mikie.  It‚Äôs always a subtle jab.
Ok so we both agree no reason to hold it against Sherrill¬†
Who cares about that? Progressives are at a net loss of 3 seats according to recent elections. Moderate dems are at a net gain of 15. She has better and cleaner records than those 2.
I actually do believe she‚Äôs the strongest candidate. I‚Äôm a big fan of hers and have been for years. She‚Äôs a veteran and an all around badass. She‚Äôs also brilliant and definitely qualified, but I do worry about her electability as a woman sadly. Ultimately I will vote for whoever is the Dem nominee at the end of the day. I hope it is her! 

I might be biased cause I went to a fundraiser of hers recently and met Chelsea fucking handler lol. It was really cool. But really I‚Äôve loved her for years. I am young and fairly broke-ish and she‚Äôs the first candidate I actually donated to (when she ran for the first time a few years ago). 

If she loses it‚Äôs still a win cause we really need her seat in Congress.
Please go vote harder üôè
I think it‚Äôs a bunch of people that work for Sherrill out here doing damage control for her.
Says the account made in August with one post karma, 49 comment karma, which has exclusively talked about Fulop except for one comment on r/thisisus asking about all candy bar.¬†


You're projecting as badly as a Republican.¬†
What a fucking shill...
I‚Äôm not supporting anyone that‚Äôs giving up a house seat. Those are very precious and I‚Äôm not willing to  jeopardize them. Josh and Mikie are both a no for me.

I also just think Fulop is way better than her across the board.
You make a good point. I‚Äôve noticed that people that have known her for years like her a lot. But people that just met her feel she falls short. I don‚Äôt know maybe Congress has changed her?  I‚Äôm not seeing what y‚Äôall are seeing.  And I watch everything.  It‚Äôs always Steve or Ras with the one liners.  She doesn‚Äôt do the üëçüèΩüëéüèΩ like she‚Äôs scared.  I think she‚Äôs too much a part of that Democratic machine now which is not appealing to me.  It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs muzzled and can‚Äôt say what she‚Äôs really thinking.  I hate that.  I want honesty.  That‚Äôs what I like about Fulop.  He‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt care.  He says what he feels. Always.  It‚Äôs so refreshing and I think that‚Äôs why people love him.
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that, that‚Äôs why I asked. Doesn‚Äôt seem like they actually have a good reason to call him a creep.
No idea what any of that means but okay.
Your name should be flawed logic¬†
Yea but hes a progressive and they are losing is the ultimate point im making so go ahead.
I think being muzzled and not being able to say what you feel is an unfortunate side affect of running for office as a woman and it‚Äôs literally taught to women politicians (which I despise.) 

The number one political training for women in NJ is ready to run at Rutgers. I attended it and actually left early. Instead of fighting these kinds of rules that women have to abide by, it leans into them and I really really hated it. It‚Äôs the literal playbook for women in NJ politics and I hate it so much. An argument can be made that it‚Äôs the only way to actually be elected, having to play them at their own game, but I really do not like the system.
You dont know that is looks sketchy to dedicate your whole account to one candidate for governor?
Your name should be i_shitz
What about Mikie makes you think she‚Äôs not progressive?
I want the candidate that will skewer Jack C during the debate.  The only one I can see taking him on and winning the general is Fulop. The governor‚Äôs gender is a low priority for me.
Sketchy how? This is what I care about right now and I never really used Reddit before. Someone recently told me there was a lot of discussion going on about the governors race. Which there is. I‚Äôm here for the same reason you‚Äôre here.
We all shitz tho¬†
Progressives don't win red districts lol.
There‚Äôs no way Fulop wins. He‚Äôs too progressive in a state that is more and more right-leaning. His stance on Israel will also kill him. Plus actual progressives hate him because of the insane levels of gentrification he‚Äôs brought to Jersey City. It‚Äôs completely unaffordable now. So he will get hate from both sides. Just my two cents. 

Also just as someone who knows him he‚Äôs kind of a douche üòÜ but my above opinion is purely based on his electability nothing else. ‚ù§Ô∏è
So you‚Äôre saying she‚Äôs conservative?
It‚Äôs funny on another page someone is calling Fulop a Republican and you‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs too progressive.  Lol. He is an issue based candidate. So all the labels are subjective and stupid.
No
They aren‚Äôt subjective and stupid when they relate to his electability. Everyone running for office is subjected to labels and being categorized whether we agree with them or not. 

And yes I already said ‚Äúreal‚Äù progressives don‚Äôt like him. 
 I said he‚Äôs not progressive enough and also too progressive depending on who you ask.
She voted against trans kids. Thats pretty conservative IMO.
Who do you support again?
You're boring lol. She voted against that so she could win a seat. Welcome to politics.
I like Mikie personally but I support any Dem who can win.
Unlike you, I‚Äôm not in politics. I‚Äôm not getting paid to post on Reddit.  I actually care who becomes my next governor.  That‚Äôs why I want Fulop.
So you are supporting the conservative blue dog democrat and criticizing Fulop for not being progressive enough? You‚Äôre super inconsistent.
Well he has a record of corruption so that's not going to win lol.
I don‚Äôt think you understand anything that I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm not criticizing Fulop for being too progressive. I am simply stating that parties will find him either too progressive or not progressive enough and that makes him a weaker candidate. It has nothing to do with my opinion.
He actually does not. He‚Äôs been charged with zero. He is a super popular mayor that‚Äôs been elected 3x in a landslide.
Mikie is too conservative to be the governor of NJ.  Her aligning with the Dem establishment and county chairs is repulsive. Her voting for the NDAA was disgusting.  I agree that Ras will be skewered by the GOP for being a radical leftist. Mikie supporters are in denial about her viability. 

Fulop is winning over Independents so he is not registering as extreme in any direction.
Don't care, he's got dirt on his name and progressive candidates aren't popular so enjoy the L.
You‚Äôre entitled to your opinion :)
There is no dirt.  Saying there is dirt with only speculation and zero evidence is gaslighting.  Tell me why you think your candidate is better without making sh*t up about mine.  Be better.
If your MO is to smear Fulop by manufacturing a ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not progressive enough‚Äù narrative vs showing us how Mikie is better, then  you‚Äôre already on the losing side of the argument. She is super problematic and she should stay in her house seat.
Not interested like I said you're boring. She's gonna win solely based on the fact that fulop won't win over suburban voters. And also again because progressives are not winning enough elections at the pace that moderate democrats are. Her policy is good, she has great credentials and accomplishments, isn't tied up with corruption and is favored by most new jerseyans thats why she's been leading the polls.

According to recent poll out of FDU, she has the highest favorability across the left, including with Progressives and Socialists lol. I don't even like looking at polls which is why I prefer recent elections as better data. When you search fulop corruption you can see the dirt for yourself lol. Whether it's true or not is up for debate, but that's dirt nonetheless. Dirt is a trail of bad publicity tied to his campaign.
Are you purposely being obtuse bro?

lol @ ‚Äúproblematic.‚Äù Using that type of language and running perfection tests on candidates has REALLY been winning us elections. Keep going with that.
I love that FDU poll.  Unfortunately you‚Äôre reading it wrong. According to that poll Fulop has double digit favorability, single digit unfavorable with the most room to grow. The more that people are exposed to Fulop, the more they prefer him. That‚Äôs why he does an insane number of meet and greets. He shows up for absolutely everything.
Unfortunately that's your opinion, and it's not valued by me lol.

LOL. It's your opinion that I'm reading it wrong of course it is."
Trenton: would you consider it to be further integrated into Greater NY's Tri-State area's sphere or into Greater Philly's Tri-State area's?,"Between 1990 & 2000 the Office of Management and Budget actually used to include Mercer County into Greater Philly's Combined Statistical Area (CSA), but it then changed its mind and has ever since included it into Greater NY's CSA.

BUT THEN you look up what the Federal Communications Commission says and it has always included the county and still does to this day as part of Philly's Designated Media Market Area rather than as part of NY's one.

Aznd it's like: hello???

From what I've read in terms of dialectology there's a notably sharp as well as fully palpable & manifest line dividing NJ into a Greater NY-dialect-speaking roughly top-right half of the State strictly conformed by the section of Greater NY's CSA that lies in NJ on the one hand & a Mid-Atlantic-dialect-speaking roughly bottom-left half of the State strictly conformed by the section of Greater Philly's CSA that lies in NJ as well as by coastal Southern NJ.

So I guess my next question is predictable: which of the two is spoken there?

And what if it actually was part of both? Can two CSAs overlap in a given small area acting as nexus between them?",0.56,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jgjhqd/trenton_would_you_consider_it_to_be_further/,20,1jgjhqd,2025-03-21 15:28,"If you look at television, Trenton gets Philly news and sports.
The test, for me, is simple. Do you get Mets/Yankees game on TV, or do you get Phillies games?


There is a small band in the middle of the state that gets both which would indicate that two CSAs can overlap.


It's most important to note that I'm mostly talking out of my ass here. Go Birds.
Trenton is both.  They get 2 of every local station (fox, NBC, ABC, CBS, ect.)
I‚Äôve lived in the NJ metro areas of both NYC and Philly, and now I work in Trenton. From my perspective - I can see a little bit of both city‚Äôs characteristics/personalities melding in Mercer county, but to me the area definitely leans more Philly than NYC. As others said it‚Äôs more pork roll, Philly sports, Philly music stations etc than NYC. Which kinda makes sense to me, as it‚Äôs closer and easier to get to Philly than NYC from Trenton for sure. 

Also anecdotally I know a few people who live in northern Philly/PA that also work in Trenton but I‚Äôve pretty much never met anyone who lives in NY and still works in Trenton
Princeton-Trenton is kind of it's own CSA.
Trenton is 100% Philly-adjacent, literally and spiritually. When I lived in the Tri-State area, believe me, no one was thinking about Trenton at all.
Trenton is very much in the Philly sphere of influence. And everyone I know from that area turns their th's into f's like in Philly.
Well it‚Äôs pork roll country so take that how you will. I would say that Trenton, Hamilton and Ewing are more Philadelphia oriented. The rest of the Mercer County towns are more NY oriented.
Dividing line is further northeast, around Princeton area. Trenton is firmly in the Philly sphere of influence, though it is somewhat unique in that it offers direct regional train access to both cities
Trenton actually gets both Philly and NYC stations
Yeah, that's what I assumed when I discovered that the Federal Communications Commission includes Mercer County as part of Philly's Designated Media Market Area rather than as part of NY's.


But then again, the Office of Management and Budget includes it into Greater NY's Combined Statistical Area (CSA), not into Greater Philly's CSA.


I guess I just struggle to conceive how can it be part of one in terms of CSA but then part of the other in terms of media market.
Trenton gets both.  Actually all of Mercer county gets both.  Growing up I used to watch an hour of the Simpsons on Fox from Philly. Then I'd switch to the NYC fox and they would have another hour of Simpsons
Yeah, that seems given the universal agreement.


I find it bizarre though that the Office of Management and Budget is getting this wrong, they are a US federal executive office that has been for many, many decades the unequivocal maximum authority on defining the limits of CSAs.


Especially bizarre considering the fact that from 1990 to 2000 they included the county in Greater Philly's CSA, and then they changed their mind and have included it in Greater NY's ever since.


This is the extension of Greater NY's CSA according to them: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/New_York_Metropolitan_Area_Counties.svghttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/New_York_Metropolitan_Area_Counties.svg


And this the extension of Greater Philly's:


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Valley#/map/0
Well, the Office of Management and Budget most definitely disagrees: this is how they've defined Greater NY's CSA ever since 2000 as I've said:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/New_York_Metropolitan_Area_Counties.svg/997px-New_York_Metropolitan_Area_Counties.svg.png
It‚Äôs physically closer to Philly, but the commuting patterns give it closer economic ties to NYC. So from a cultural standpoint it‚Äôs Philly adjacent, from a statistical standpoint it‚Äôs more NY. 

Really, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd have been wrong to place it in either of the CSA‚Äôs. It‚Äôs very much tied to both
My guess for the OMB distinction is that they probably found that people from Trenton are statistically more likely to take a job/commute to work in Federal Jobs in NYC or Newark (in NY CSA) than in Philly. Part of it is that CSA are a lot larger than media markets in a lot of cases. Baltimore is in DC's CSA but has it's own media market with some places getting both Baltimore and DC content like Trenton gets NYC and Philly. According to Wiki there's 181 CSA and and NBC has over 200 affiliates (roughly correlated to media markets) so it makes sense that some CSA include or overlap multiple media markets.
It is an interesting question to be had there for sure. I remember being surprised at how big some offices like the OMB consider NYC‚Äôs metro area to be
Which aspect of this map is inconsistent with what I‚Äôve said here? There‚Äôs nuance between cultural ties vs economic ties
Ohh that makes complete sense!


It also explains why from 1990 to 2000 they included it in Greater Philly's and then from then onwards on Greater NY's.


In all likelihood, it was that year when the Greater NY area surpassed the Greater Philly one as the one of the two with which Mercer County has commuting patterns of the greatest volume.


I do think though that they shouldn't have removed the county from¬†Greater Philly's CSA, like I get it, they don't want to open the door to partially overlapping CSAs, but I think this is actually more confusing & counterintuitive.
I get what's up already!

From 1990 to 2000 the Office of Management and Budget included Mercer County on Greater Philly's CSA, and on Greater NY's one ever since then?

Why? I'm almost 100% certain that because that year the volume of the commuting patterns between the county and the Greater NY area overtook that of the commuting patterns between it and the Greater Philly.

I do think though that it was a mistake on their part (and still is a mistake on their part right now 25 years later given the fact they still haven't corrected), like I do get why they didn't want to open the door to partially overlapping CSAs, but nonetheless I still think this is even more confusing & counterintuitive than it would be to list the county as part of both CSAs."
Beware of Hackettstown Bagels in Hackettstown NJ,"This place used to be called Budd Lake Bagels, but they changed management and everything went downhill. Not only has the food gone up and price while declining in quality, every time I've been there since they changed hands, the employees give themselves a generous tip without my knowledge. If you pay with card there, be aware you ARE being scammed! I thought it was just one girl doing it, until I went back and was helped by someone else and it happened again. Yeah, I should've called them out but it's hard to do on the spot like that. And, I only noticed once I took my receipt back to my car. I talked to some other folks and discovered I'm not the only person this has happened to. I only went again because my family likes the place, but it's not worth it anymore. Great way to run a business. Take your money to Hot Bagels Abroad instead, better food and HONEST prices!

If you‚Äôre in Hackettstown, get Hot Bagels Abroad. F Hackettstown bagels.
I thought about popping in just to see what the hot dog was all about  

Man that sucks sorry. Leave a bad review and tell others. 

I go to Valley bagel just because they make a roast beef that reminds me of my childhood in Bergen County. We have been happy with them for a while.
im happy this subreddit seems to be more clearheaded than the Htown facebook groups i follow. if you dare mention this place in a negative light, or most places, you get shit on.
No bagel no bagel no bagel
Hot Bagels Abroad is my go-to bagel place. They're one of the only places near me that have good asiago cheese bagels, and I love that they put tiny bits of sundried tomato inside the bagel!
So, you got scammed, then went back to the same place and got scammed again? 

There's a lesson in here, somewhere...
Ugh that sucks. I went there once and  I asked for 2 bagels, one with butter, one with cream cheese... received 2 bagels with butter. The fact that they couldn't even be bothered to do that right was enough for me to never go back. 

the bagels were very mediocre anyway.
A little bit out of the way but A&B in Andover has such good bagels
First, this is why I pay in cash everywhere. Second, the minute you noticed this you should have gone back inside and made her reverse the charge and ring it up again. Barring that, call your credit card company and dispute the charges.
Yeah we go to mount olive bagel now right next door.
This place is on my way to work and Ive been going for about 2 years. Never had a problem with the place under the old owners, nothing great, just an average bagel place. But now with the new owners, I agree its trash. Legitimately takes them almost 10 minutes to put cream cheese on a bagel while barely any customers are in. One time I sat there in awe just trying to make sense what 10 employees were actually doing behind the counter.

One time I got a bagel that must have had a pound of cream cheese on it. Like ridiculously excessive. So the next time I went, I asked for light on the cream cheese. They gave me a bagel that literally had a paper thing layer of cream cheese. Like literal ""paper thin"". Haven't been back in like a year now
That‚Äôs sad. We moved to Long Valley last summer and was recommended Hackettstown Bagel. Granted they were busy, but we felt completely unwelcome and like we were supposed to feel lucky to be waited on. We don‚Äôt often get bagels, but we have since gone to Long Valley Bagels. Not only are they very friendly and thankful for the business, but the first time we went, there was a guy in there with his two young kids (one slightly older than the other). The older kid was being a good helper to the dad and was helping the younger one. The store owner commented to the dad how good the kid was and asked if it was ok if they gave her a treat for being a good kid. Loved that.
If you‚Äôre closer to the Rockaway Dover area try Pops bagels, stellar bagels but the sink holes will throw you for a loop traffic wise.
Hot Bagels Abroad is the best!! Or if you‚Äôre in Washington, Muheisen's!
Wait a sec, they hand you a receipt but you can‚Äôt read it until you are back in your car? You see the extra charge on the receipt that they gave you but drive away? And come back again after confirming from other people this happens?
This is not the first time I‚Äôve heard something like this about this place.
hot bagels is right across the street and 10x better anyway. i fuck with their macaroni salad heavy too
Leggo my Bagel in Kenvil and now in Byram absolutely SLAPS. Affordable, fast as hell, and they're bagels are always perfect. They also serve some amazing Spanish food.
Are the prices posted? How did you ge scammed?
Hamburg Hot Bagels is the place to go if you can. Best bagels in the county.
You need a little more detail if you are making a serious allegation against a small business.

Are you saying they signed for a tip in a blank tip line after the fact? Or like most businesses they are using a customer facing electronic CC machine and they marked off a tip without you noticing before approving the charge?
Fr.the spot down the road by new quick check was better but still garbo.bagel bistro in andover or adams bagels over by itc.
Love Hot Bagels Abroad!
insane macaroni salad too
Can't say enough good things about  Valley Bagel. Been going there regularly for about 5 years now and I love their food.
The secret to the roast beef is the sous vide
Uncle Tony‚Äôs hot dogs is full of controversy. The lady who started it got put out by the people running the bagel shop and her partner Tony stayed but Tony wasn‚Äôt the Tony it was named after it was the lady‚Äôs late husband who was the OG Tony. Now Tony was also pushed out and I‚Äôm surprised they still are serving over priced hogs. The mint olive mayor is the one who bought it and sank it and then changed owners again recently. The place used to be so good now it‚Äôs just a hick scam spot.
I go there for the cheese bagels too. They're so good
Yeah, I was prepared for this comment. It's the only place my sister will eat a bagel from (ARFID) so I sucked it up
Or, to put it another way, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me!
I love their bagels. Used to stop there a lot when I worked in Newton. The one in Randolph is good but doesn‚Äôt hit the same idk.
This is the way to do it.  If someone charges you for services or goods you didn't agree to, and the owner won't fix it for you,  call your credit card company. 

 That's exactly why charge backs exist.  It can be pretty punishing to the business and it will cause their payment processor to do an investigation or simply stop working with the vendor.

Always give the vendor a chance to fix the issue themselves, but if they don't just let visa/mc/your bank handle it.
Different place than the one mentioned here.
Super nice people over at Long Valley Bagels. I go there often too!
Yeah, I know I'm a little too un-confrontational. I'm not a fan of causing a scene.
Not to keep shitting on Hackettstown Bagels, but they have easily the worst macaroni salad I've ever had. They gave me en EIGHTH of a pound and charged me $2, and it was just nasty stuff. Maybe they only gave me a tiny bit because they knew no one would eat it lol. And I'm a 21 year old dude who will eat pretty much anything if I'm hungry!
Sussex county must have the lowest bagel places per capita then any other county in nj, luckily Hamburg hot bagel is pretty good.
You know how sometimes when businesses use a register with an ipad, they flip the screen around and ask you if you want to enter a tip? They didn't flip the screen around and just added one while keeping it facing them. Then they told me my total and flipped it around so I could tap my card once it was past the tipping screen. I noticed later once I took a look at my receipt, because it showed a 15% tip. I thought it was just an issue with one person but I've had it happen to me multiple times with different workers.
I do this! It‚Äôs just that sometimes I need it now and I‚Äôm out at the moment. 

I‚Äôd actually have some, but a few nights ago we lost a lot of power in Hackettstown and I was running on fumes, completely forgot to reset the sous vide after like the fifth time. 

My disappointment was immeasurable. I had big plans for that beef (to be in my belly)
Damn news to me! Glad I never stopped in. 

Genuinely surprised it was even purchased after what, the fourth car blew through the light and into the building?
Dispute the charge on your card and report them for fraud
Can you even read I used to go bud lake bagels now I go here cause of what they talked ab
You need not confront them. Call your credit card company. I know AMEX loves hearing about this crap, they take these reports really seriously.
I have bagel bistro, Augies and the little spot on 15 right by the railroad crossing, where 15 drops down to 2 lanes , all within 5 minutes.  I can't remember the name of that place for my life. Sucks getting old
DareDevil Deli & Bagel by the Sussex County airport is good as well.
You should ask to speak to the owner. Not saying you need to give the business a second chance; but if you are upset about it saying something to the owner will likely get at least someone fired. I'm sure the owner doesnt care if people are tipping his staff or not but would care if his staff are doing something that could lead to a complaint his CC processor and piss off customers.
They are talking about the Budd Lake bagels that was in hackettstown you dolt.  Not the one next to Mt Olive Bagels.

You should call 211 like others are saying, just be warned they tend to be rude and unhelpful. Just don't expect compassion and prepare to possibly have to call them back repeatedly 

You're likely going to be directed to a shelter and last I checked you're going to have to go as far as Trenton or Newark since this state/counties/townships refuse to build shelters.

Also try your county Board of Social/Human services directly. Might be best to go in person, trying to reach Social Services over the phone can be a nightmare.

I've been homeless for about two years. Been in a motel for going on 8 months, but I should have an actual apartment in a week or two, finally.

Do what you can now to start the process now, keep your chin up
Depends on the type of help you need. People say 211 and if you're going through any kind of DV situation I'd definitely recommend them for that. It's mainly just a referral source for homeless shelters, soup kitchens, etc. Good luck to you OP. Also try r/homeless and r/almosthomeless.
I am not in the same county but reached out for help in han after facing some housing instability. I called all the numbers and all the right places BUT no one was able to help. Everyone said they had no funding, no space and no advice. 

Good luck.
Contact your county offices to start with. They should have many resources to work with you.
Contact your local board of social services. They can help in a variety of areas
That's the neat part!


You don't. At least for the next three years and ten months.
In New Jersey, individuals experiencing homelessness or in need of housing assistance can¬†dial 2-1-1 to connect with the NJ 211 state homeless hotline, which can help find resources and connect them with community services.¬†
You can dial 2-1-1 and they will give a lot of resources and should be able to tell you your next steps
If you are in need of shelter immediately you can speak to their Homeless Hotline and they might be able to place you for a night or a couple of nights
They will also likely recommend you to call social services to get extended help.

I hope you are safe and get help if you need it!
If you're a veteran, Lyons VA has  homeless housing and lots of help available.  Call (908) 647-5717.

ACLU urges NJ to message to congress to protect our voting rights from the president's administration (link in description),"I received an email from the ACLU that wants us to message to congress so we can protect out voting rights.

""At a time when attacks on our most fundamental rights, including the right to vote, are on the rise and the federal Voting Rights Act is at risk of further erosion, New Jersey has a crucial opportunity to protect and expand voting rights in the Garden State. The John R. Lewis Voter Empowerment Act of New Jersey (NJVEA) will protect our right to vote and increase access to the ballot for all of our residents ‚Äì especially voters of color ‚Äì by reducing barriers to voting, increasing language access and assistance, prohibiting deceptive practices at the polls, and ensuring that all voters can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Send a message to your lawmakers and urge them to pass the NJVEA now.

The New Jersey Voter Empowerment Act (S3009/A4083) has stalled before the Legislature since its reintroduction a year ago. This moment calls for immediate action.

My experience with the Andy Kim town hall today.,"Just went to a town hall with andy kim. I ask about ranked choice voting. He is very much in favor of it but thinks it has little chance of passing. He openly talked about how bad FPTP voting is and said it promotes extremism.  This was after the cameras stopped rolling and was taking peoples questions after the event officially ended. Very good event overall. He has two more coming up tomorrow and the day after. Its worth going too. 

Some of the other questions from people were very thought provoking and quite sad. A example being this. 

One lady had a issue where she had to pay 330 thousand yearly due to one of her children having (i think it was) severe down syndrome and some other health issues, and was basically only staying afloat due to medicade that elon wants to nuke out of existence, they get called every two weeks to justify their existence. 

He also affirmed that he takes no money from pro israel pacs and is very pro palestine, said that the stopping of aid to palestine is very immoral.

Really packed too. The venue holds 150 people, there were nearly 400, it was extremely packed and a lot of people were standing. The crowd was very diverse too, lots of asian americans and people of all financial backgrounds. 

He did stay late and answered everyones questions, and i mean everyone. He answered well over 50.  It was also very orderly, there were maga people there too and even they were very respectful of kim. 

It was relatively disorganized, they only had two days to plan it and the guest speakers were very mediocre, thats my only complaint. 

Not a complaint but andy kim was shorter then i was expecting. Just adding this in. 

If anyones interested. https://www.kim.senate.gov/townhallseries/",0.97,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jg564a/my_experience_with_the_andy_kim_town_hall_today/,100,1jg564a,2025-03-21 01:16,"Before Andy was elected, he came to just about every teacher's union conference we had. He talked about the teachers in his own family and their belief in education. I do believe he sincerely got into politics because he had a belief he could make things better.

Re his height, I never thought twice about it and I'm tall. (shrug)

I am so glad you went and that you wrote such a detailed post for those of us who couldn't get out of work.

That's my (former) Congressman! Makes me feel even better about voting for him. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
He‚Äôs a good man. Met him in Toms River when he was running for NJ3.
He thinks ranked choice voting is unlikely to pass at the federal or state level?

Federal, I get

But at the state level, all we need is a law that says municipalities can use it if they want to. Would be great if he was an advocate

Jersey City, Hoboken, and Red Bank already passed trigger ordinances that‚Äôd put ranked choice voting into effect once the state assembly + gov give the thumbs up
I've seen him host a forum for the Democratic gubernatorial candidates at Rutgers-New Brunswick a few weeks ago with my college student organization.

I got the same impression as you did about Andy Kim. He really seems like a genuine guy and is a positive force in New Jersey and the country as a whole.

At the event, 4 of the candidates showed up. It was Sean Spiller, Ras Baraka, Stephen Fulop, and Mikie Sherrill. All I will say is that I liked Mikie Sherrill the ABSOLUTE LEAST of those who showed up. She definitely did not give off the same impression as Andy Kim.
Thank you for taking the time to write this up!
> Not a complaint but andy kim was shorter then i was expecting. Just adding this in.

I'm  a 5'5"" tall guy (maybe shorter now that life has beaten me down some), and while working in NYC, I dealt with people in London, all via phone calls. When one of them came to NYC for a meeting, he told me, ""you sound much taller on the phone!"" I always took that as high praise for some reason.
Not sure how big the other venues are but go early. A lot of people (including myself) were denied entry because they reached capacity. They hadn‚Äôt planned for it but after some back and forth two people inside offered to livestream it for those outside.

As people left early they let those that stuck around in. I‚Äôd say about 1/3 of us persisted and eventually got in even if it was only towards the end. I was disappointed to stand outside most of it but happy to see so many show up
Thank you for this well typed out summary.
Thank you for sharing this!

> Really packed too. The venue holds 250 people, there were nearly 400, it was extremely packed and a lot of people were standing.

""The town hall had an estimated capacity of 150, according to the senator‚Äôs office. There were about two dozen people outside, watching on their phones. Some of them had been turned away at the door because of a lack of space.""

You were only off by a couple of hundred people.
Did he share why he voted to approve kristi noem?
How was the crowd mix in terms of R and D?
I‚Äôve met him and he‚Äôs about my height. So, yeah. Short guy.
It was really nice to see so many people show up last night and I appreciate Kim coming to south Jersey to hear from his constituents. Too bad Van Drew won't follow Kim's example.

I walked away from the event feeling that Kim understands the moment we're in and that he deeply cares about our constitution, country, and state.
Thank you.
Andy is the real deal. We're lucky to have him.
Rank choice voting is the best way forward! It‚Äôs the only way to make it a fair election. A hill I‚Äôll willingly die on (and probably will be screaming this until I die)
Andy Kim seems like a nice guy on a personal level but I absolutely do not think he is cut out for the current crisis we are living through. He made some major blunders trying to help confirm Trump's notoriously unqualified and in many cases openly fascist cabinet appointees. From day one he should have said that we aren't going to cooperate with a president who is an aspiring dictator. I only hope he has realized that the bipartisan cooperation mindset he came in with is not going to hack it right now.
How did you find out about the event? I signed up for the telephone town halls the other day at least. Feel like I hear about these things afterward, lol.
Thank you for going and thank you for letting us know what happened.

I don't know, I sent an email/complaint with a specific issue and I just got back a form letter which wasn't in any way directed towards my issues.  At least send me a form letter which is somewhat relevant to my issue.
>He also affirmed that he takes no money from pro israel pacs and is very pro palestine, said that the stopping of aid to palestine is very immoral.

That's good to hear. In a time where trump is trampling over human/civil rights, it doesn't do dems any good if they go about waving the israel flag while they commit a genocide. The stance a politician takes on gaza/israel these days can make or break their credibility when it comes to addressing human rights in this country and abroad. 

Now I wish I can say the same for booker.
Yeah I like him.  I listened in to his telephone town hall last week.
Sounds pretty good.¬†
What did MAGA hat say?
Andy Kim is an effective and reliable senator. We are highly fortunate to have elected him in November.
Is there a specific type of rank choice voting that you prefer? My preference is 3-2-1 approval.

I wish Andy would have expressed more support for Palestinians during the campaign. He might have gotten my vote if he did.
BIG BIG QUESTION: why does my congresswoman (Bonnie Watson Coleman  , district 12/middlesex) NEVER announce public meetings until AFTER she‚Äôs held them???? Is she lazy or running away from something? Not very impressive

What about what he wants to do about the feckless Democratic leadership, including Chucky?
If this guy, or Booker, do not call for Chucky to resign and for a change in overall leadership in the next week, I'm supporting anyone who primaries those pathetic mofo's. Absolutely insulting.
Hope there's enough humanity to also be for the state of Israel, and he doesn't conflate genocide and war during the last administration. Otherwise, what language can be used to show a distinction between what was happening to what's happening now and going to happen during Trumps term.
Had some extremely brief interactions with him. Nice. Charisma of a leaf of arugula wilted on a restaurant kitchen floor. Able operator. 

I miss Bobby M$
When he repped NJ-3, Kim accomplished his goal of doing a town hall in *every town in his district*. 

NJ-3 included northern Ocean at the time (including Brick, where he'll be Saturday morning), so he was going south of Toms River to hold events. 

A lot of people at those town halls didn't agree with his views, but they really appreciated him coming down to talk to them. 

From what I remember, all of those town halls were respectful, too.
My wife is a journalist and actually got to meet him. She said he was really good at providing detailed answers and took the time to clarify when she had follow-up questions. From everything I heard he seems like a genuine dude
what about his height
MAGAts gotta wear their fucking hats everywhere - god forbid someone doesn't know \*immediately\* that they get on their knees for the president. 

It's like a friggin security blanket.
I saw myself in a few (standing in the wall opposite to you, fat guy with a beard and american flag hat, mostly black clothing, second in the left side of the third photo, i view myself as a public figure at this point so i dont really care about remaining anonymous, as im running for local office) glad you liked the event too. I'll be back at the next one if he ever does any more in atlantic county. These are all nice photos, good job. I hope my congressman jeff van drew or governor murphy does one eventually as well, but i doubt it.
If he did, he'd probably only call on plants.
Isn't Gottheimer running for NJ Governor? I'm not following Gottheimer closely, why wouldn't he do a town hall?
Same, yeah that line item on the ballot was the first one I was actually excited to fill in in quite a while. Massive upgrade from Menendez.
I would guess Kim meant at the federal level since that's the level of government he works in and where he has a vote on proposed bills. 

>But at the state level, all we need is a law that says municipalities can use it if they want to. Would be great if he was an advocate

That would be the state letting ranked choice voting be used at the municipality level. That's different from having ranked choice voting in state level elections like Governor.
Yea. I agree. I did ask too if he had a plan to help get it through but he moved on to another question as there was still a few people left wanting to ask stuff to him. I cant blame him for that. I hope we get it at a federal level some day in the future.
Hoboken implemented run-off, not rank choice.
Lol, think dems in this state are going to enact anything that might threaten their majority?
Not surprised, Sherrill is my Rep and she's done some questionable things since she was first voted in and refuses to give me an answer why even though she literally represents me. I told her I won't forget her unwillingness to communicate with her voters. She plays both sides as it suits her.

I hope there's a better candidate that goes against her next time.
For people planning to go to the other townhalls - I lined up to enter the event at just about 5:30 (6:00 start time) and snagged one of the last available chairs. I'd recommend lining up no less than an hour before the townhall's start time
Typo, ill edit it, thanks for letting me know
He was ask it. His answer was basically ""you gotta choose your battles"". He thought he could have a better chance of convincing people to vote against people like OMBs russell vought if he voted for other trump nominees to not appear as just a hater who was going to vote against every nominee and was putting in thought to each vote. He did say he regretted voting for some of the trump nominees like noem and lutnick though.
Pretty mixed, more then just r and d, also independents and third party people came. Ill say it was 60% democrat, 25% independent, 10% republican, 5% third parties. Everyone ask questions from all around the isle.
Copy, Dan.
At least he doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúshort man syndrome‚Äù (Little d  energy) that so many others have.
Very short. When I went to the Sussex County Convention last year I was shocked to discover I was taller than all but one of the candidates (I think I come up to Sue Altman's elbow).
Sell me on it and/or do you have any good resources on it? 

Personally I am a little skeptical of it having viability in the US where we don't really have any choices when it comes to political parties , any plurality, real coalitions, our elections happen on Tuesdays(yes I get early voting is a boon but we don't have a nationalized day for it or universal voting rules) I feel like people barely understand the system we have now and to campaign on the platform I feel like could lose some people, center squeeze phenomena,  ""vote is wasted"" when exhausted, etc.

Don't get me wrong, I ""get"" it in theory I just don't really see how it could work out or somehow lessen any sort of disenfranchisement again when physical party options are so low. Idk I just think of NYC still getting Eric Adams in the end of everything and how it's like ok your affiliated party won but the guy kinda sucks by a long shot.
I only learned about it the day before, it was a last minute thing with next to no advertising. This was not a well organized event.
Thats more a issue with his staffers, who he has not too much control over, they reply most of the time instead of kim in my experience, he even said as much when ask about it.
He was concerned because he has a disabled friend who had a meager job, 20 dollars a week, for helping with putting out chairs for events at this one place. The friend asked the social security office if itll effect his medicade benefits, the person they ask said no. He then went to court for having to pay it back for the last several months despite getting the wrong info. The maga hat guy was concerned over his friend and was asking andy kim for his opinion on the situation.
I prefer approval voting but rcv is more well known overall so whats what i ask kim. 

Yea, its a shame he didnt talk about palestine more while running.
He was ask about chuck, does not want him to resign but was severely disappointed in him, he wants younger leadership overall.
Why? Were you bribing him as well?
Actually, after 11/5/24, you‚Äôre a confirmed LOSER.
Be kinder to your self. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
He refuses to do them and when he does have one of his ‚Äúcoffee at a diner‚Äù events, he leaves immediately after talking and NEVER takes questions.
He's busy blasting YouTube ads like crazy
He's a republican running as a Democrat with ELON money. That man in cancer and we should absolutely avoid him unless we want a truly red state. Fuck that douche canoe.
Ugh, I was glad when the party FINALLY stopped pushing Menendez. The guy's a despicable embarrassment.
oh for sure - didn't want to assume just in case he had some insider NJ knowledge to share lol

and yeah i was just saying the lowest barrier to entry would be state legislation that says ""municipalities can use it if you want it""

i know that's different from using ranked choice voting for state assembly/senate/gov. just think that a ""municipality permission"" bill would be easier to pass than becoming just the 3rd state to use RCV for state-level elections
Not sure why your getting downvoted, your fully right. Rcv was banned in washington dc local elections for the same reason, despite them never using it officially (their official excuse was even worse, it was too complex for minorities in the city). Republicans banned it in deep red states for a similar reason, for its complexity, despite not being that complex, but its probably also to prevent the libertarians and constitution party from taking off there, they have sued them off the ballot in the past. There are both dems and reps who support it but the party big shots wont let it through.
Something similar happened at the gubernatorial forum.

Andy Kim asked the candidates to give a thumbs up to a short list of some pretty progressive policies if they supported them. Baraka, Spiller, and Fulop all gave their thumbs up for all of the proposals. Kim asked her why wasn't she putting her thumbs up. Sherrill responded with something along the lines of, ""I support the policies, but I don't want to put my thumbs up."" I couldn't help but think, ""Really? Why can't you be straightforward?""

But what really solidified my dislike for her was when she was asked what would she do to resist or combat Trump's policies, especially on immigration. I am paraphrasing, but her response was something along the lines of, ""That's not my job, that's more of the Senate's job..."" and turned to Andy Kim.

I'm like, ""YOU ARE THE STATE EQUIVALENT OF A PRESIDENT!!!! WTF DO YOU MEAN THAT ISN'T YOUR JOB!?!?""

Basically, she really pissed me off with that response.
Thanks for your response
That's fair. Some days have to feel so futile--I appreciate his honesty.
Fair call, then. Unfortunately that tactic would only work if party line didn't overrule logic, but I guess he learned his lesson this time.
Well, that's na√Øve yet well-intentioned of him.  It was a failed strategy but I guess I respect that he actually tried a strategy.
Maybe a silly question, but how did you know the breakdown? Did they ask people to sign in for the town hall or something?
He‚Äôs got 6‚Äô2 energy.
Gottheimer gives me those vibes lol. My short friend saw him at his gym and confirmed he‚Äôs shorter in person tooü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Thanks
Why would he have no control over his staffers?  I get that he can't answer every single email, but they should still follow his protocol.
not resign as senate minority leader? not many are asking him to resign from congress, it's about resigning as minority leader. Andy Kim is fine with him as leader?
You're trying to get me to catch a case!
Im already quite kind to myself, trust me.
Thanks. I remember not liking some of the things his Problem Solvers Caucus was doing a couple years ago. I'll have to see who else is running for Governor.
he doesn't stay long at a diner, you say?

maybe he feels vulnerable without [his bulletproof vest!](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-squad-thumbed-their-noses-at-the-status-quo/#:~:text=Gottheimer%20quickly%20began,the%20hell%20out.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D)
Elon pays for em
I received an general email from her saying:

""I am excited to invite you to my town hall on Thursday, April 3rd, at 5:00 PM focusing on how I am standing up to Donald Trump and Elon Musk in Washington.""

After what you said, I doubt that she'll do anything except doubletalk. 

 I mean she's 'standing up' to them, but can't even give a thumbs up in public? 

Like I said, she plays both sides. She plays up her military experience to the R's and her D status to the D's trying to come off as moderate as if she thinks R's are voting her in. lol

Who knows, I might agree with her stance if she would actually give detailed answers as to why she is leaning that way. She comes across as unreliable and weak. Pick a freakin' side, Sherrill! Maybe consider the people that actually voted for you ?

edit:typos
Good question!
I was just going off vibes, peoples clothing (lots of political wear), and what i overheard people speaking about before/after the event. A few people did self describe too. Im probably quite off so add or subtract like 5%, maybe even up to 10% for the amount of dems/independents. There was certainly a loud republican and third party minority though, and more reps then 3p's
He said he wants younger, newer leadership, but said nothing at all about having chucky resign, just that he was disappointed. He didnt say much about him, he moved on relatively quickly. Not really anything to add from there.
Not sure what issues are important to you, but if you want someone who pushes back on trump and will work to protect our freedoms and jersey way of life, it is either steve fulop or ras baraka. The other candidates won‚Äôt defend us in the way that is needed now.

In any event, you should watch the first debate of all candidates and that will show you a lot about them and whom to vote for.
Straight up my guy.

If you firmly believe in something, say it with your chest out. Don't play coy or be meek.

This is honestly just my opinion, but I think that people are honestly tired of ""moderate Democrats."" The type of Democrat who in reality would likely align with conservative parties in other developed countries.

You can't exactly ""stand up to Trump"" if you are reaching across the aisle under the assumption that the other side is acting in good faith.

Voters want a populist candidate who can ""stick it to the elite/establishment."" And Trump played that card (even though he is a member of the elite/establishment being a rich guy, but I digress). Liberal civility politics isn't cutting it anymore.
Exactly!"
What‚Äôs at stake for NJ students if the DOE is dismantled.,Data from the National Parents Union. ,0.95,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jg4gfm/whats_at_stake_for_nj_students_if_the_doe_is/,215,1jg4gfm,2025-03-21 00:40,"Given that NJ pays more than we take, I say Murphy and the State Legislature should pass a bill directing businesses to not take as much out for federal tax, and to reallocate that money for replacing this lapse in funding. What the fuck are we even paying for at this point?
Now imagine if NJ was able to keep the money it paid into the federal budget that was allocated to the DOE. 

That won‚Äôt happen.
The fact that we're one of the top most educated states and we can only avg a 51% for 4th grade math and reading is concerning though.
Can't believe it's gonna take another two generations before some people realize how fucked we are. When their kids can't afford go to college whatsoever because loans will be far a few between. Their grand kids will go to a massively underfunded public school, and the parents won't even be able to afford private school with their lack of college education leaving them with low wage jobs. All because Grandma and Grandpa decided brown people were evil and that getting rid of them would save them money.
Oh, they know. They know what we stand to lose and thats why they're doing it.

You've got to understand: Republicans hate you. They hate your kids. They *despise* you, and they want you to suffer. They might want this because of the trillion-dollar christofascist propaganda industry that their brains have been boiled to perfect smoothness in, they might want this because they think its what their mockery-of-Christ butcher-god wants, but they want it nonetheless.
My mom is a special ed teacher in a low-income district, 10 years out from retirement‚Ä¶ this will make her job even harder
Time to get in the streets
If Kean votes for this that university needs to purge his family name from the school
It's all part of the plan to keep power.  Remember today's uneducated child is tomorrow's republican.
But what about the billionaires? They need a bigger tax break.
There's no point having kids now. Why set them up for failure..
Sadly, this will make living in NJ even more expensive. Not because of higher taxes, but because our education system is already the envy of the nation, once the lower tier states start to feel the pinch, people will be moving away from them, if they can, and to places like NJ. The brain drain is already happening in the south and midwest, it is only going to get worse.
You really think the current government will read this and go ""Actually, maybe this isn't a good idea.""? Having all the problems laid out for them is making them cream thinking of the suffering this will inflict on us.
And this is just the K-12 impact. Think about all the research being done by our Universities that is now in jeopardy. Our higher education while deeply flawed is the best in the world and attracts the best and brightest from around the globe. It's a reason America is a leader in science and technology.
Not going to say that it ISN‚ÄôT going to happen, but here‚Äôs a quote from the Secretary: ‚ÄúClosing the Department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them‚Äîwe will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers, and others who rely on essential programs.‚Äù http://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-return-power-over-education-states-and-local-communities
Please learn how the government works.

1. Trump can‚Äôt eliminate a department created by Congress.  Only Congress can do that.
2. Executive orders can and will be reversed.
3. Trump is a wannabe dictator trying to make America a fascist country.
4. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone has noticed this, but Trump does something stupid, that his supporters think is great, then the adults step in and stop him.

This is performative politics.  Stop voting for stupid people.
So which governor in nj running is not a sleaze bag thatll abuse the extra funds? The low property tax guy looks like a sleaze bag in his own commercial.
FWIW, this is what AI said:

The NPU‚Äôs opposition to eliminating the DOE is rooted in legitimate concerns about funding, equity, and oversight, particularly for New Jersey‚Äôs 2,500 K-12 schools and 1.3 million students. However, the proposal to dismantle the DOE does not eliminate federal support but reassigns it to agencies like the Treasury, HHS, and the Department of the Interior, while empowering states to take a larger role. This restructuring could reduce bureaucracy, increase local control, and maintain critical programs like Title I, IDEA, and Pell Grants, albeit through different channels. While risks exist‚Äîsuch as potential disruptions during the transition‚Äîthese can be managed with careful planning. The NPU‚Äôs argument assumes that the DOE is the only way to ensure equity and accountability, but a decentralized approach could better serve students by prioritizing local needs and fostering innovation, all while preserving federal funding in a new framework.
The end of the world
Working people taking it on the chin so Trumps billionaire friends can have another tax break .
46B in loans across 1.2M and people is criminal‚Ä¶
Just because I'm dumb, eliminating DOE means no more state funding?
I thought parents in nj, ¬†teachers in nj and students in nj cheered when Murphy said he was getting rid of parcc? ¬†Instead he just changed the name. ¬†

Can someone explain why we are now all clamoring for federal oversight when all it does is force kids to waste a week of school to take a dumb laptop test that isn‚Äôt scored until sometime over the summer? ¬†It is a complete waste of time and a huge waste of money.

Is Pearson putting out this propaganda because they are afraid they will lose the insane contract they were awarded to create and facilitate the test? ¬†
even with NJ being one of the best states in terms of lack of dependency on fed $$ for education this is still gonna hurt a lot. both short term and then long term when there is some type of tax hike to make up the difference.

Genuine question: let‚Äôs say we keep DOE exactly the same, how is anything going to change? Kids aren‚Äôt getting smarter, their attention spans aren‚Äôt getting longer, and teachers jobs aren‚Äôt getting easier‚Ä¶ what is the solution? (From an independent who doesn‚Äôt know what to think, not a trumpie lol)
19% of NJ students are disabled? 243k kids?
This is all a scare tactic!!!!!  Let‚Äôs be real for a minute. Do you parents really have a say in your kids education?  Absolutely frighten NO!  If you disagree with any board you are labeled a ‚Äúdomestic terrorist‚Äù and a background check is a possibility, and that if you can even get in or speak. DJT, whether you like him or not IS giving the power back to the states to make decisions on what should be taught. Personally, If I had a child, I would have a real problem teaching my preschooler about the ‚Äúbirds and the bees‚Äù. Leave that to the parents!  Research the national Parents Union and see who is funding this propaganda.  Open your eyes people!
~50% proficient in math and reading‚Ä¶ sounds like the DOE is only half efficient
The definition of insanity ‚Äúcontinuing to do the same thing and expect a different result‚Äù. Take a look at our test scores and defend the current system?  It is broke it needs to be fixed
Wow.. I‚Äôm won‚Äôt sure why more then one thing can‚Äôt be correct at a time. Just because we pay extremely high taxes that doesn‚Äôt mean that the money is being appropriated properly. We can still have a good education system without overpaying like we do. There is a ton of waste in our government and that is nothing new. My grandfather used to ask me why I thought the government pays $2,500 for a hammer. This was never an issue that parties were in disagreement over. Smaller government is always better. I‚Äôm not sure why finding government waste is a bad thing. I would be happy we were cutting spending regardless why is finding it
I grew up in Bergen County, so is my entire family. Except one Aunt who is family lived in Morris County. Unfortunately, many of my family members are MAGA. It is fucking priceless to me when they complain about the Department of education because we grew up with some of the best schools available. Nothing was ever wrong then. But now that all the kids are out of school it suddenly become this massive issue.
Nerfing the department doesn't equal eliminating all the funding. A lot of this stuff will fall under offices in other government departments. This will just eliminate a lot of administrative costs associated with running it as a separate department.
The question is ""Is NJ Education Department ready to take care of its bills after what happened yesterday afternoon?""

If the answer is ""no"", then we know how NJDoE became so ineffective through the years despite showing ""successes""

If the answer is ""yes"", then why worry? The last time I know who sets the tone in education curricula is the state DoE.
The flyer doesn't make a very good case IMO.  Trump is proposing to replace federal funding with similar block grants, allowing the states more freedom in allocating that money, it's not necessarily that all of those programs, or any, will disappear tomorrow.  Although I'm sure funding deemed DEI, helping minorities, helping those with disabilities, etc will be the first victims.  From what I understand the states already handle over 90%, or something like that, of curriculum decisions.

I don't know that quoting student outcomes is convincing either, is that due to the DoEd or due to NJ?
The fact that only about half of 4th graders perform at or above grade level doesn't say much for how things have been going until now. Maybe it's time to change things up and put in place a local process to hold schools accountable?
All I want is for the government waste to stop on Federal and State levels. 
We wouldn‚Äôt be this far in debt if all of this waste was uncovered years ago. Everyone needs to show transparency. We as taxpayers and voters have a right to know. 
Sometimes people just want to turn a blind eye. And when the shit hits the fan every one is outraged. 

Stop üõë the bleeding and do deep dives on the person who you want to vote for.
I wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping the department of education if we dismantled the teachers unions. A lot of teachers in that do care about the students, but like any union it also protects the teachers that stop caring once they get their 10 year. I remember each and every teacher that no longer gave a poop because they couldn‚Äôt get fired.
>What the fuck are we even paying for at this point?

We fund the red states who continue to vote against both our and their own interests :)
As a parent it is so disheartening. My husband and I know we pay a boatload of taxes and we‚Äôre okay with that since we know our children will get the best education. It‚Äôs unconscionable to me that humans are okay with not supporting the goddamn future.
On point.
He can fight to keep the federal taxes from them. I believe it was Maine who originally threatend it. Idk if they can actually do it but who tf cares? If Trump wants to violate shit and ignore judges, we fight back and keep federal taxes. Use it in NJ
Paying back to the rich
>What the fuck are we even paying for at this point?

Police and Trump's golf trips.
Yes. Call Gov Murphy and your state reps and ask that NJ force all employes to withhold  $$ that they would otherwise give to the IRS for federal and payroll tax, and for the State of NJ to take this money instead and put it into an escrow account.

NJ has one of the worst balance of payments on the continent. This means you work hard, pay a lot in federal tax, and then all of it goes to Mississippi where they build useless volleyball stadiums and fund abstinence only lessons in their ""schools"".

r/NYEXIT
Yeah let‚Äôs pass a bill that makes the average citizen liable for paying tax penalties to the IRS. The state of NJ pays nothing to the feds. Each citizen the state and each business in the state pays.
Fucking BINGO
They say NJ has one of the higher ""per-kid"" spend which makes us one of the smartest states, but I see signs saying 55% of NJ kids cant read/test at their level... So you're right... What are we paying for?
Imagine if NJ kept all of the tax revenue it generated, period. 

The height of comedy is that red states are literally welfare states. 

Let capitalism sort out their funding.
All that money is going straight to billionaire tax breaks.
NJ IS able. Call Gov Murphy and your state reps and ask that NJ force all employers to withhold $$ that they would otherwise give to the IRS for federal and payroll tax, and for the State of NJ to take this money instead and put it into an escrow account.

Any sources on this? I'd like to read more about it -- I wasn't aware
Last spring's fourth graders started school in the 2019-2020 school year, which caused huge problems in foundational skills we are still playing catch up on. Their first two years of school were fucked.
Those test scores represent all public school children in the state. The kids with two college educated parents and the kids whose parents left school after 6th grade in the DR. They represent kids with dyslexia, autism, etc. I‚Äôve taught kids who have been read to from infancy and kids who have been raised solely by iPads.
The rest of the country dropped below a third - a five percentage point drop since 2019. It's  scary.
I am thinking this exact thought! What is it that we need to do to have 100% of 4th graders proficient in math and reading? Maybe the money isn‚Äôt being spent correctly, but taking it away is NOT the answer ! That statistic is staggering.
As someone in college to be a teacher, it‚Äôs the parents not caring about the education enough, and social media and phones . I can assure you most  4th graders don‚Äôt read outside of school. But know all the latest TikTok slang. I just taught my yesterday for my practicum and a kid literally farted and the boys in the back started jumping around the room. This is what we deal with and those are 8th graders who can‚Äôt tell me who won the civil war. Schools just pass kids because they don‚Äôt want that to reflect badly on the schools and parents don‚Äôt actually care about their kids education. Teachers and other people have been complaining about the state of the education system and nobody really seems to care
Yeah, the DOE was good at making sure there was funding and avenues for kids who are disabled, but I'm not sure they've done a great job making sure the average American kid is educated.
teachers are required to teach too much to too many with too little. that‚Äôs 3 problems in one setting.

smaller class sizes require more teachers, more support staff, and (more vexingly) more physical space. all of that requires more money. it‚Äôs an ouroboros of conservative/capitalist greed.

public schools are partially defunded by rich people sending their kids to private schools and the goal is to get their public funding pulled also, leaving public schools with only the poorest and most disabled children with only the funding of their parents. making all schools de facto private, but with the caveat that all disabled kids get left behind.

keep in mind that we have the data that shows that smaller classes have better outcomes. integrated glasses have better outcomes. funding by property taxes harms schools. etc. just like we have the data that shows eliminating poverty to be the best way to eliminate crime.

as always: conservatives only want to conserve wealth and power in their own hands and nothing else. and every accusation is a confession
This is cherry picking the COVID lag kids. They're aren't a representative sample of all kids learning levels
We‚Äôre always in the top 3 states educationally. Is frightening, as we could improve so much still.
Yeah, but Grandma and Grandpa got theirs and they'll be dead by then.
we are already there, tho. where we‚Äôre going is going to be worse
spot on
I don‚Äôt get it. My sister is a special ed teacher and she is happy about the decision and hates the dept. of education. The reason seems to be that people waste money. But I can‚Äôt understand how this move helps that concern.

Wealthy republicans look out for each other, and poor republicans kiss their boots because they think it‚Äôll help them be wealthy one day.
Been saying that for years!
And yet only barely half of 4th graders are at the proposer math and reading level? I'm guessing they picked that age bc those kids started school during COVID but not sure it's a fair representation of our school systems
'the envy of the nation'
I didn't know if you've noticed, but laws don't matter anymore, and no ""adults"" have stepped up to stop him or Musk. Oh, sure, a judge might say ""you can't do that"", but the response is ""yeah, and?"". And it's not like the Republicans (or many of the feckless Democrats either) on either side of Congress are doing anything to oppose him. (Oh, and SCOTUS farked itself out of irrelevancy by giving the ""President can do what he wants"" ruling)
Yes... But he can still create havoc and mayhem with these EOs because they take time to get struck down or reversed.
Trumps abuse of the executive order relies on people who dont understand how the government works. The people who support trump support his attempts to make the executive order a dictator law making machine. You'll notice the majority of resistance to these unconstitutional EOs is from the courts, not congress, whose power they usurp. This is because the Republicans have the majority and they support this one stop law machine. There is a bunch of news about an executive order, which usually is struck down fairly quickly, but his supporters, who think the president is a king, are left with the impression that the president can unilaterally make a law, despite us literally separating this power for a reason. I asked my father, how is he represented in an executive order? His response was, ""because he likes it"". I asked him how he would be represented in an EO.he didn't like. No response.
Is this what Trump/people in charge of this transition have said..? Also does that mean those agencies would take care of funding the things that the DOE used to fund? Thanks
As of now, I believe NJ will mostly be okay. It‚Äôs states that rely on federal funding. So states that are already in the red and already have lower education rankings will feel this the most. 

This will absolutely negatively impact low income areas, special education programs/school, the ability to feed students, etc etc.

But also I don‚Äôt know the full trickle down. NJ generally puts emphasis under democratic leadership. If a guy like Jack is voted in and wants to ‚Äúlower‚Äù taxes the easiest target is education. Much like what Christie tried to do
Would partially fix the federal tax issue regarding paying to fund schools in other states. Just sayin
I agree the current system needs work. I just don‚Äôt think cutting a massive amount of money without a plan makes sense. 

Our most vulnerable kids are going to suffer bc there‚Äôs not enough money for accommodation tech, or individual aids, or whatever. You can‚Äôt just cut a bunch of support without an actual plan for how to fix the problem.
not that I think the NJDoE is great, but there's not much contingency planning you can do for 'no more fed funding at all'
You should probably have a plan for students before fucking with billions of dollars of funding and calling it ""changing things up"".


Especially if you are cutting Congressional appropriated monies without Legislative approval (unconstitutional and illegal).
How local? How many systems are there in NJ currently?
Yes, let's change things up by defunding special education. Surely that will help test scores.

My kid gets fabulous test scores, the 99th percentile across the board. That's because he had an IEP that gave him the services he needed to become a successful student starting when he was three. He needed years of speech, OT, and PT, which he received from my local public school district. They were extremely accountable to him and to me.

But you, coming from the bottomless wisdom you found in your asshole, want to change that up? What in the actual fuck are you talking about?
We also need to factor in the pandemic and the effect it had on our kids. Virtual learning was a nightmare.  
  
Source: me who decided to enter nursing school in Fall of 2019. lol
How about we hold parents and students accountable before we decide to dismantle the department of education?
Did anyone read the actual order? Apparently: 

Critical programs, including Pell Grants, student loans, and funding for low-income students, will still be administered but through other agencies.
Tell this to parents of children with special needs that maybe we should shake things up, fucking clown shit.
Prepare for downvotes.
Where is the waste, specifically? Not hand waving boogeymen. Actual waste. Specific roles, with evidence, that should be eliminated. We‚Äôll wait.
This. 

We always pay into the pot more than we take out of it.
I learned that 75% of West Virginians are on GOVERNMENT healthcare. In NJ it‚Äôs 18%. I‚Äôm all for government provided healthcare. But WV hates anything social, and vote across the board Republican from mayor to Congress to presidency. Maybe we should stop sending funds to states like WV for a while, so they can see if they truly hate government services, and don‚Äôt bite the hands that feed them.
This is some next level irony.
If they don't want to abide by the rule of law, why should we? Exactly.
Exactly. If the feds violate every law, why do we have to obey federal laws?

Gov Murphy better grow a pair and do EVERYTHING it takes to protect the financial interests of NJ. r/NYEXIT
The feds spending that money elsewhere is the point, I think. NJ sends something like $4 or 5 to Washington for every $1 that Washington spends here.
Yes, and if the State of NJ pledges in such a bill to legally back any person that the fed attempts to harass or arrest, then that particular problem is solved. And before you say, ""That's just insurrection,"" I am well aware.
The national average is 70-80% of students reading, doing math, etc. below their grade level. Also just saying they don't read at their level doesn't really show the scale of deficiency.

Like NJ 42% of fourth graders from a 2022-2023 study were reading at or above grade level, and the deficiency tapers off from there.

Oklahoma had 71% of fourth graders rated as ""not proficient"". Not just not below grade level but straight up not capable of reading proficiently.
It means education is expensive and imagine how dumb those kids would be if we halved the budget. We'd be on par with Missouri instead of Massachusetts.
The current 4th graders are COVID kids, meaning they missed important time in classrooms during the pandemic, which explains the poor reading levels. If you look at the figures pre-COVID, 4th graders in the state were reading at higher levels. This will rebound in a few years as post-COVID kids enter the system, having not missed schooling from the pandemic. If those numbers don't rebound, then there is cause for concern. 

And the Federal government cutting spending on education could lead to test scores remaining low.
Or directly into Elon‚Äôs pocket through additional subsidies.
Incorrect. The states have no power to influence federal tax law. You‚Äôd see a net increase in taxes.
Congress is the group with the power to adjust our corporate and individual tax rates. Cutting the DOE funding doesn't change our taxes it just means the federal government has more unallocated revenue which they will do the dumbest shit imaginable given the GOPs history.
The covid lag is real and the numbers scary, even more of a reason to be doubling down on improving education and making sure that avg improves though
My son was in 1st grade when COVID happened and even now they see the kids struggling still. This is going to impact that entire generation.
Honestly I blame this on the parents.  I also had a child starting kindergarten during Covid.  It took more from us but my wife and I were on top of her remote schooling. Making sure she was paying attention and helping her when she was having issues. In fact I was doing my remote work right next to her while she was in class and helping her to stay focus.  What I saw on camera were plenty of kids playing around and not paying attention, some were on their beds jumping around. 

When she went back to non remote, other than the social aspect, she did not have any academic issues.
Hey I get it, no student is the same, I myself fall within several of those cases, and know plenty others who also do but by the laws of averages we should be doing better than just half. Even with those cases would you say that it's ok that 1 out of every 2 elementary schoolers does not read well or can do fractions?
Realistically no one will ever get 100%, but achieving at least a 70% should be doable, and defunding schools certainly won't be the way
I don‚Äôt disagree with anything you said. So what‚Äôs the solution? 

If we are on the same page we‚Äôd say pay teachers better, makes schools safer so people aren‚Äôt afraid to go to work and kids aren‚Äôt afraid to learn, and let the tax payer‚Äôs money that we are already paying so much for go towards these things. 

There‚Äôs no perfect solution to what is deeply broken in the DOE, but the wall we run into is how allocating our high taxes goes to the right sources. It would be important to fix in general, but we are in a time where we have an administration whose main objective is just to blow shit up and turn their backs. So what now?
And continuing with the same structure and not changing policy helps how?
Agree, hoping in the near future we can use ai to teach a portion of the children.
Do you know what the stats are for 5th graders? That would be the last unaltered sample
I‚Äôve spoke to my mother in law the other day and she literally has that mentality. ‚Äú I got mine, fuck everyone else.‚Äù 

Or ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt impact me so why do I care‚Äù
The problem for me is that they don't seem to have an alternate plan that makes sense. So while maybe the system could be improved, just slashing and hoping for the best, or not caring to hope at all, isn't it. 

Even teachers can support bad policy, even when it regards their area of expertise
There always seems to be a disconnect between all of this funding and actual classroom impact.

It is rarely felt.  You hear about the millions of dollars going into schools but then parents still find themselves buying supplies, and the grades don't seem all that improved.   

The belief is that not much is actually being lost by cutting off this money because the impacts of it are not obvious.  Theoretically it should force the wasteful skimming types to move on.

Realistically though, many of those people will just move on to wasting and skimming whatever new system gets put in it's place.
oh honey. your sister‚Ä¶ is bad. she should get out of SpEd before she hurts someone.
Brother, your sister might be a moron. DoE is not perfect by any means but it is vital for keeping track of student progress and stopping discrimination.
Kean lol
That's exactly why they chose it.
it was picked to show where this is really gonna hurt the most, not celebrate nj schools
If they could read they‚Äôd be real mad.
https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/369/text:

* Treasury: Gets Pell Grants and student loans (e.g., $30B and $1.6T portfolios) starting January 1, 2027.

* HHS: Takes IDEA special education funds (e.g., $13.3B).

* Labor: Receives Perkins vocational education (e.g., $1.4B).

* DOJ: Handles Title VI and IX civil rights enforcement (part of $147M budget).

* HUD: Manages McKinney-Vento homeless education (e.g., $114M).

* States: Title I for low-income schools (e.g., $18.4B) becomes block grants.
It‚Äôs not gonna be ok. My property taxes are increasing 1500 next year because the state already can‚Äôt fund schools. With the loss of special education funding, that will either go far higher or we will simply shove children with special needs into a dark hole because that‚Äôs all we can afford.
it's most definitely not going to be okay and business as usual

just the gap on the critical k-12 programs is ~$1b.  That is going to be filled by tax payers in an already highly taxed state, so we're all getting hit even if you're not in a poor area

the higher ed gap is huge
Now you prove my point. NJ DoE, will be naked on its deficiencies sooner than many would think.
It's like every other fucking thing they are destroying. And the minions just nod their noggins saying yup, this is good.
Looks like it's all about money and not ""education"" in terms of the department of education actually improving student outcome. Of course, it's important for kids to afford schooling but isn't public school free? So the money actually goes to the schools? Does this mean our real estate taxes go up? Or maybe we examine public school funding?
I graduated nursing school fall 2019. Baptism by fire.¬†
How about holding parents and students accountable and NOT dismantling the DOE? One does not need to happen.
How do you propose to hold students and parents accountable?
OK, great. *Which* agencies? Are those agencies prepared to take on the additional workloads? Have the agencies *also* had job cuts? How long will it take for employee access to systems for those agencies? Is there training in place?

There is *nothing* in Trump's history that indicates he has any sort of plan in place for anything he does, so I don't have a lot of faith this transition is going to be smooth and not affect Americans who need that funding.
That's fine. If people can't engage in honest discussion, that's their problem. 

Give everyone vouchers and let them pick the best school for their kids.
You essentially pay double taxes: state tax to fund NJ's robust social programs, and federal tax to fund pointless invasions of Iraq, and abstinence only programs in West Virginia. Let's stop this madness: r/NYEXIT
DOGE is going to backfire so hard on these people.
We get back about 75 cents on the dollar for what we pay which ends up being tens of billions of dollars.
that is because we have high paying jobs and a lot of them.  Nothing is keeping those jobs here except proximity to NYC and Philly and old fashioned get your ass to the office thinking.  The government knows that remote work is a death sentence for their flow of tax dollars at all levels local and state.  I can easily work from anywhere but chose to stay for family, cultural and frankly it is too much of a hassle to move. 
And the feds spend that money elsewhere on a lot of things besides social welfare. Retirement benefits and SS for folks that moved to red states is a big one, military bases , civilian federal employees, check out how much VA and MD pull in for all the DC staffers, etc.
""That's just ~~insurrection~~,"" enthusiastic tourism, wasn't it? Or antifa plants?
The state can't pass a law that circumvents a federal law.  The taxes are yours and mine not the states
Where do the ""grade level"" standards come from?  I mean, if NJ is one of the top states in education, and only 42% of students are reading at grade level, then maybe the standards are not in line with what most kids at that age are capable of achieving?
Elon will be the first and only welfare trillionaire. He sucks more $$ out of taxpayers than every single poor single parent does combined.
Ahh I get what you're saying. 

But yeah, in a perfect world the savings from the elimination of the Department of Education would go towards reducing the deficit. In reality, it will go towards tax cuts for the rich.
We did a great job with it, as well. However, not a lot of people were able to do what we were.

I had a set up for her, she had a desk, chair, fun calendar (to do with class), chalk board behind her to know her school schedule. I got a bin for all her school work and work books, and such. It was right off the living room, so we could see/hear how things were. 

She started kinder in ‚Äò19 and went virtual in ‚Äò20. She stayed virtual until ‚Äò22 I believe, she went back for the last week or two though. ‚Äò23 is when she went back to actual school. 

We also did lazy eye therapy at home, due to not wanting my kid to have glasses and eyepatch and a mask on. We had setup going well, so it was fine. She finished speech therapy virtually. 

I think my kids classes / teachers were pretty good about keeping virtual & in class learning the same thing. 

But again, I know a lot of children and parents had a terrible time and experience.
I had the same experience with my child also in Kindergarten. The issue I found was that the teachers had a hard time keeping up with giving the kids work to do.  Many days my child would finish an assignment in a matter of minutes and then just be sitting there idle waiting for the next lesson to be posted.
I agree that it‚Äôs not ok. Teachers know how to teach these concepts, but the parents are not doing their part. Reading and math skills are strengthened through practice at home. Kids refuse to do homework. I can‚Äôt go home with them and force them to memorize multiplication tables and read.
I‚Äôve been having this conversation with my husband a lot and I obviously don‚Äôt know the answer. But I think even bussing kids to ‚Äúbetter‚Äù neighborhoods to make a more diverse school isn‚Äôt necessarily the answer (I am NOT against integration but feel like bussing says ‚Äúyou and your neighborhood aren‚Äôt good enough‚Äù which isn‚Äôt the case). I AM thinking we need to change the way that our impoverished schools are teaching our kids. Get specialized teachers, therapists, dedicated staff for after school etc. There are so many things that can happen so everyone has a chance at a bright future. 
We only have 4 more years of hell and then we can put everything back in order.
Defundng low income schools potentially causing student reallocation and overcrowded schools will not help either. You do realize this set up will almost certainly will lead to more taxes right?
Tremendous boomer energy
Yeah. I can‚Äôt find anyone who can say what the plan is. And I guess it really is the blow it up so it can‚Äôt work plan. So education will get worse, be privatized, and then who knows what. Without knowing what the plan is, it is much easier to go to the worst extreme as a possibility.
Right, like the people with waste at the school district level who are getting paid way too much, or spending too much on new buildings, are still going to milk whatever system gets put in place. It isn‚Äôt the department of education going to each district.
Why would she hurt someone?
Thank you. See politics are so screwed because neither side is ever fully heard
Again, probably should examine public school funding before fucking with it.¬†
I'm just curious. Where and when did you go to school? When is the last time you've been in a classroom?
Maybe you should actually learn about how all of this works before trying to destroy it.
Damn, you'll be the badass on the floor years from now telling your new nurses how you overcame the pandemic. <3
That's funny. How do you hold parents and students accountable?  From the educators I know, the vibe I get is that parents don't want to hear it and little can be done to correct a student that refuses to cooperate.   Forcing the issue just creates problems for the school, so nothing happens.
Stop passing every single child when they underperform. Children that are issues in class and are not taking the work serious should be left back. 

No child left behind was a mistake. Also, speaking as someone who is intimate knowledge of the school systems, parents need to stop babying their god damn children. It‚Äôs not always the teachers fault if a child fails a test or is disruptive in class. It all starts at home
Retain students and truancy charges.
Yeah, no. That is not how it works at all.

Vouchers provided for private schools don't cover the full cost of tuition in those schools. Lower income families cannot afford that tuition, voucher or not. So those vouchers for ""school choice"" amount to nothing more than a taxpayer-funded discount for rich parents who don't even need it.

For the rich individual who can afford that private education, yes it's beneficial. For the majority of residents who cannot afford it, there is no such choice: they rely on free public education for their children, which is a public benefit for us all. Defunding that public benefit and offering vouchers only leads to more wealth disparity, more uneducated children.

Yes there are problems in the system. Destroying that system appears to be quick and easy, but it doesn't solve those problems. You've got to do the hard work of actually fixing the thing if you really want to see better outcomes for our children.
The voucher system is a scam to send your hard earned tax dollars to religious institutions and privately held charter school companies.
Wonderful idea, maybe you should see what universal vouchers did to Arizona‚Äôs schools first.

Cool then we can have police and fire vouchers? I don‚Äôt want my tax money going towards saving/serving crappy neighborhoods
Right! I‚Äôm cool with our robust social programs, but funding school vouchers and abstinence only in states like West Virginia? It‚Äôs absurd.
> Nothing is keeping those jobs here except proximity to NYC and Philly and old fashioned get your ass to the office thinking

Utter bullshit. I travel a lot for work, and 99% of the country is a culture less wasteland. People who can afford it obviously want to live in places with culture and services and the prices reflect that. I worked for fully remote companies for the last 15+ years, and outside of a few weirdos, the majority of the high earners live in NJ, NYC, and CA despite the opportunity to live anywhere.
It would just be a policy of love lol
And the Federal government can't ignore the Constitution and the Judicial, nor can it be led by a felon and a foreign agent...and yet here we are.
The feds break every law why does NJ have to obey laws?
Honestly the testing should be fucking scrapped and do some random sampling or something. I've got family who are teachers, and my mom was a paraprofessional helping special needs kids and it's all so fucking stupid.

These struggling kids who are already having issues learning are forced to take county, state, federal standardized tests for something above their level and so all the effort goes into prepping them for tests that determine school funding rather than actually teaching kids. You literally had kids with severe autism who were barely verbal given a test and the para would basically just try to get them to fill in random bubbles on each line.

We spend all of our time ""teaching to the test"" instead of just teaching kids and it's a fucking disaster for schools. Like I get that you need metrics to know that schools aren't failing students but by forcing them to jump through hoops you're forcing them to have worse performance.
Dismantling the DOEd (which only congress can do) only hurts the poorest states and students who don‚Äôt have rich families to pay for their schooling.

States and kids rely on that money the DOE is provided through federal taxes. If taxes were somehow adjusted to reduce our taxes and allow the state to take the difference, it may actually be enough to fund that directly through an increase in state taxes‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôd then need to replace one large bureaucracy with 50 of them, one per state, to handle the provisioning of those funds. It‚Äôs just such a stupid thing to do now that our systems are set up around it, and it won‚Äôt help any Americans to destroy it.
homework is pointless and useless. ESPECIALLY for elementary and middle school aged kids. we know this. we‚Äôve known this for a long time.

reading to kids is important. but if a parent can‚Äôt read, how are they going to help?

if you don‚Äôt already know this about homework i suggest hitting the studies. i learned about it 15 years ago, so it‚Äôs not new.

and just a couple of notes from a ‚Äòdouble college educated‚Äô household: 
1) reading logs are hot garbage and no one is telling the truth. 
2) any work that isn‚Äôt supervised by their education professional should not count for a grade.
I think the plan is to tank our education system intentionally, furthering the erosion of intelligence and critical thinking in the American populace, and continue looting the country. 

We are already pitifully dumb, fat and lazy, but still could probably muster a defense. A few more years and it won't be true anymore. 

That's my cynical as hell take anyway. Hope I'm wrong.
Yeah. These types of posts are so confusing because 95% of the comments are just people who are uneducated on the topic and i can't get a grasp on what's actually going on. i hate trump as much as the next guy, but everyone and i mean EVERYONE complains about DOE. It's getting harder and harder to discern what the reality is, where we should cut, where we need improving, etc.
Why would anybody
Did anyone read the actual order? Apparently: 

Critical programs, including Pell Grants, student loans, and funding for low-income students, will still be administered but through other agencies.
Discipline, allowing the students to fail if necessary, not just pushing them through the class/grade, doing what you can as an educator to get the parents involved (or more involved) in their student‚Äôs education and future, and for lack of a better phrase, allowing them to reap what they sow, be it good or bad.

I am not just an educator, a teacher, or an instructor, but I am a mentor to make my students become the best version of themselves that they can be. Not all students are equal, and some will pass while others will fail, and that is ok. Those who fail need to accept it and work harder, put in more effort, do extra work, and the parents need to be involved for that to happen. Too many people teach for the test, not for life, and that is a big problem. IMO that is how we hold them accountable. Your opinion may vary, and that‚Äôs ok too.
My wife is a recently retired teacher. One of her best lines was when parents asked why she gave their kids a particular grade? She simply said she didn't give them anything, they earned that grade. On the whole, after listening to stories for decades, parents have gotten weirder and lots of kids, dumber.
Truth.
How do you determine which neighborhood is good enough for your tax money?
Because red states hate blue state residents so much, each state should pay for its own stuff.
'Nothing is keeping those jobs here except proximity to NYC and Philly and old fashioned get your ass to the office thinking'
Oh gawd the expert over here telling us why our state is worth anything at all. Why do people talk with such an obnoxious level of confidence like this? Even if it wasnt complete garbage, people should just learn how to communicate with some degree of intelligence and even a small amount of humilty, in order to be taken seriously.
and why are we not a cultural wasteland . NYC and Philly. Just look at extreme So Jersey or extreme Northwest NJ No easy access to those places and it turns into Alabama.  You think Montclair would be a super desirable place to live if all the investment and banking industry left?
As a parent to a first grader, I don't love homework but I think it serves a few purposes. It definitely reinforces what he learns in school and shows if he remembers the concepts and can do the work without a teacher's guidance. It also lets me see where he's at developmentally and how learning is going. And it's much needed extra practice for skills that they often only have like 40 minutes a week to go over. The kid hates stopping what he's doing to do homework but there's definitely a sense of pride and accomplishment when it's done that's good for him too. I've seen those studies but I have some doubts.
It‚Äôs this mentally that has us in the situation we‚Äôre in.  Homework is important, it‚Äôs practice of what they have learned and also helps the parent know what the kid is doing. Maybe even helping them understand if they are having problems understand.  As parents we know our kids and may know how they learn better.  Yes the parents don‚Äôt know everything, but elementary level work is not hard for an adult to quickly pick up and help a child.
Can't say I agree here.  Homework is important just for the practice, especially things like math. We do try and balance our kids lives with non school and fun stuff as well, so it's not like I want them to be slaving away at homework for hours.  But I do value the time I spend with them helping them with homework and find it very productive, especially when they are coming from a class of 15:1 or worse, I find that one-on-one time to be very valuable.
You are not wrong. The oligarchs don't want an educated populace, as an educated populace is one that is more difficult to control. They've been working on this my entire life. It wasn't the election of Obama that broke the Republican leadership's brains, it was LBJ's signing of the Voting and Civil Rights acts. As the anti-war and civil rights movements died out in the early 1970s, the right seized the opportunity and used the frustration and economic malaise of the mid-late 70s to force the nation to change course.
Right? I hate going that route but I can‚Äôt stop thinking of the worst option. I HOPE something good comes out of it, don‚Äôt want kids to get screwed over. If somehow magically it turned out great, then I am all for it, but the odds seem to be less than a fraction of a percentage.
Yeah but cutting spending and effectively dismantling the DoE are two different things. If there was a plan or a solution in mind then sure, but from what it seems, there isn‚Äôt. 

Why cut DoE loose, with no replacement in mind? It will then accentuate the issue that is already present, which is hope you‚Äôre lucky enough to be born/live in a progressive state of some kind and not some backwards southern state. Taking a blow torch to the government isn‚Äôt the way. IMO of course.
>It's getting harder and harder to discern what the reality is, where we should cut, where we need improving, etc.

That's the idea.  As long as no one can really pin down the issue, everyone is paralyzed.  It maintains the status quo.

The way I figure it, it's probably all true.  I'm sure the DoEd does important helpful things, while this isn't mutually exclusive of wasteful spending and people skimming the money.  These types *would* hold your kid's education hostage because it is in their best interests.

In this case, it's extremely easy to just blame Trump.    He is just a giant magnet for all the ire and frustration people have with things.  I'm not saying he is without guilt, but a lot of people will just stop at freaking out about Trump and never look further.

It's a lot harder for people to grasp that it's a system of problems and that many of the culprits are faceless middle people or layered deep into the minutia of some ridiculous contract that is superficially beneficial.

Even then, you will be told you're not knowledgeable,   experienced, or educated enough to understand the issue, and so there really is no winning.

You'll never really know if you're fixing a problem or getting taken for a ride.
Oh, sure, he lies about everything else, but maybe he won't lie about *this*.
Agencies that can and will discriminate and move goal posts in order to give out as few grants as possible
I guess this is where I struggle.   I know of schools that would for example, take in students from the Special Services school at the Elementary school level who really weren't in a good  place, and put them in regular classrooms where they disrupted the class daily with little recourse foe the teachers themselves. 

 The school was getting extra money to take these students, but apparently the whole point was to put them in a ""normal healthy environment"" to help these troubled students,  but it seems clear they weren't ready for being in a regular classroom.   Of course, nothing was done about this since A.)this would upset the parents and B.) It would cost the school the extra money.

Even so, this meant all the other kids in these classes were essentially not learning anything most days of the week, all year long.

Now, that probably is irrelevant to main issue of the thread revolving around the DoEd, but then this is where I lack faith that ""discipline"" can be enforced.   It seems like the local busy bodies push for these sorts of policies and will punish/remove you for standing up to them through the school board or whatever other forces are at play.

When I think about school waste, this is what I think of.  Sure, the school got more money, but how much better off was it?  Do I feel bad for that special needs student? Absolutely, it's tragic, but are we not also doing a disservice to the other students?

I always hear about this ""teach for the test, not for life"" criticism but I don't understand it.  It's not like they were teaching life skills in school when I went through. Its been a while but it's not been that long ago.  

Is this supposed to mean we're teaching kids things they'll ""never use"" and punishing them for it?  I am not sure i can get behind that either.  You don't know what people will or will not need.  

It just doesn't seem like holding students and parents accountable is as easily done as it is said.
Good for her and I completely agree! It‚Äôs a shame and teachers can only do so much. Sure, there‚Äôs some bad teachers like any profession. 

But when a teacher tries to hold a child responsible and the parent gives the ‚ÄúNo. My baby would never‚Äù what else can be done? Idk, if I failed a test or got in trouble my Mother would make sure I knew right from wrong and I learned life lessons. 

I‚Äôm 30 but I feel like an old man yelling at clouds right now. But that‚Äôs my gripe hahah
The dumber kids are now the weirder, dumber parents.
Endorse!
you‚Äôre allowed to be wrong. good thing we have science to tell us that you are. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I‚Äôd say more paper homework, less of those idiotic ‚Äúlearning games‚Äù the schools give. Here in Edison, it‚Äôs chromebooks all day from elementary through high school. And this town is considered one of the better school towns. From what I can see, kids are brain fogged and depressed. If I could afford one of those tech-free private schools I‚Äôd pay, but alas Google owns my kids minds. I‚Äôve complained to admin!
nope
The only disagreement I have with this comment is the last sentence singles out the right as seizing the opportunity...my personal belief is that at the highest level Ds and Rs are run by the same people. The two party system is complicit with itself.
So one of the only similarities between 2016 and now is the wrecking ball approach to programs. Just this time it‚Äôs more effective. Remember when the idea was to blow up Obama Care because *booo Obama = bad!* and there was no replacement? Almost 10 years later enough fuck-heads have gathered to dismantle ALL of it piece by piece and now it‚Äôs working. There doesn‚Äôt need to be a replacement. There doesn‚Äôt need to be another effective plan. As a whole the plan is to have no plan. 

If you look at it like the crazies that back this do you‚Äôll say ‚Äúwell good! He has to ruin it in order to fix it!‚Äù, which is maybe partially true. The problem is what comes after that which is it will be blown up and we will live in ashes and rubble while they golf and sit in beach chairs in the new Gaza Hotel. They don‚Äôt care.
oh i am with you 100%. i literally fucking hate trump lol. i just am trying to be educated to understand the nuance of WHY this is bad. i know it's bad. literally everything the son of a bitch does it bad. but if i can intelligently explain why this is not a good thing, i'm really no better than them. you know they always say if you can't explain it, then you don't understand it. i want to be able to fully understand why i should disagree with this. not sure if that makes sense or im rambling lol .
Trump didn‚Äôt just ‚Äúattract ire.‚Äù His administration actively dismantled key parts of the Department of Education by slashing staff, weakening civil rights enforcement, and pushing policies that undermined public schools in favor of privatization. That‚Äôs not vague dysfunction. It‚Äôs deliberate policy.

This idea that ‚Äúeveryone complains about the DOE‚Äù is just a lazy generalization. Sure, there‚Äôs criticism, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the department isn‚Äôt doing vital work. It enforces civil rights in schools, manages federal student aid, and promotes national education standards. Public opinion on it is mixed, not universally negative, and painting it like some universally hated bureaucracy just muddies the waters.

And the whole ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never know if you‚Äôre fixing the problem or getting taken for a ride‚Äù line? It sounds thoughtful, but really it just encourages people to disengage. That kind of cynicism doesn‚Äôt expose corruption. It protects it.
I'm with you 100%. Also the left and the right are just as bad in a sense that no one sticks to the damn topic, or any facts. something happens and every comment. TRUMP BAD. okay but explain to me why this specific policy is good or bad? i know people don't owe me their time, and ""do your own research"", but i'm just saying reddit is a forum to discuss and there are no meaningful discussions. if you can't explain why it's bad, i can't just automatically side with you, one side or the other.

>Trump didn‚Äôt just ‚Äúattract ire.‚Äù His administration actively dismantled key parts of the Department of Education by slashing staff, weakening civil rights enforcement, and pushing policies that undermined public schools in favor of privatization. That‚Äôs not vague dysfunction. It‚Äôs deliberate policy.

The point I was making is that it's easy to get hung up on all of that and not ask how the DoEd was actually doing things.

Are you sure they didn't have excessive payroll?  How many people does it take to enforce civil rights? How much does DoEd even make a difference at the classroom level where people can feel it?  

These are fair questions, and they should be fair questions whether it is Trump or Harris running the show.

>This idea that ‚Äúeveryone complains about the DOE‚Äù is just a lazy generalization. Sure, there‚Äôs criticism, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the department isn‚Äôt doing vital work. It enforces civil rights in schools, manages federal student aid, and promotes national education standards. Public opinion on it is mixed, not universally negative, and painting it like some universally hated bureaucracy just muddies the waters.

Right, but then how do you think most people engage with these issues?  ""Lazy generalization"" is what most people have the time and mental bandwidth for.  This isn't a secret.  People are emotionally driven.  They're not spending hours looking over the facts and checking the claims against outcomes.

If they don't see a tangible impact on their kids'a school experience, they're not going to feel like the DoEd is worth it.  

It doesn't mean they don't do good work, but if you're asking people to pump taxpayer money into something with barely any tangible impacts, it's going to be very easy to feel like you're being taken for a ride.

It's such a convoluted machine that we're being asked to have faith in it with no way to hold it accountable.

>And the whole ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never know if you‚Äôre fixing the problem or getting taken for a ride‚Äù line? It sounds thoughtful, but really it just encourages people to disengage. That kind of cynicism doesn‚Äôt expose corruption. It protects it.

I think you missed the point.   What did I say immediately before this line?  Was I not pointing out  exactly what you just stated?

The whole game is to get people to be overwhelmed and check out.  It's common for people protective of these government programs and departments to gaslight people into thinking they are not able to hold the government accountable.
IMO, this is bad for two reasons:

1. Southern states can now blame the civil war on states rights. Every state can now have their own version of history. 
2. The public school system will be dismantled in favor of private and religious schools. This is what the right has always wanted. Those who can't afford or qualify to get in will be placed in even worse learning environments than they are now.

As a scientist I‚Äôll add in that the way the administration treats science, well also have a huge degradation of actual science knowledge and critical thinking.

I'm also a scientist.  I'm not sure the Democrats were much better.

They're all willing to push mindless compliance when it benefits them.

How do you justify the ""science worship"" pushed by the Democrats during the Covid years?

If you didn't ""follow the science"" or ""believe experts"" enough, you were villainized as anti-science by lay people that themselves had no idea how valid the question is.  Indeed, I've been screamed down by lay people for not describing something the way *they* were told it, even though we were saying the same thing. How dare I be educated in my field and not get my molecular bio from the news!

It was really just about forcing compliance and discouraging critical thinking, all while encouraging people to pat themselves on the back because they ""followed science"" and complied."
Real ID,"I guess my question is does anyone know if the airport is going to seriously deny you from flying if you don‚Äôt have a real ID ?? because I have been trying to get an appointment at the NJ DMV for my flight in May for like 2-3 weeks now.

Apply for your passport card. No appointment to go to or line to wait in
Yes they will. Why would they go ‚Äúwe see there is a federal mandate we need to enforce, but surely we will make an exception when you decided to kick the can down the road for the past five years.‚Äù

You should prepare to bring your passport or other supporting documents as outlined by TSA.

I‚Äôve been able to get two appointments for myself, pushed mine from March to April, made three for coworkers, and one for a friend. You just need to get online asap on Thursday as they do fill up fast.
TSA can and will start turning away people who do not have federally-approved identification in and after May this year.

NJ MVC can barely handle the traffic of licenses that are expiring and ineligible for online/mail renewal (usually because a new picture is needed). Those people are always prioritized, so you may have to be willing to travel across the state for an appointment at an agency that is slightly less crowded. But even then, that's not guaranteed, because a smart booking system would assign them that much less appointment capacity.

At this point, if you don't have a Real ID driver's license, you should apply for a passport and/or passport card if you also plan to travel out of the country in the not-too-distant future, or just a passport card for domestic air travel. The State Department has ways to expedite it if you need it in or after May, but before you can expect to get it through the standard process, but it will cost you significantly more to do that.

If you don't succeed in getting a Real ID now, get one next time your license expires. You use the same documents to get a passport, so just save them for NJ MVC when you need to renew your license and get a Real ID.
Get a passport if you can
The appointment website updates every couple of minutes and people cancel appointments all the time. I had previously schedule one 2 hours away 3 months in advance but then one day an opening pooped up closer and earlier. Just keep checking and you should find one eventually...

I saw somewhere that using a browser extension to continuously refresh the page will help you find appointments that other people cancelled
Thats interesting. I would have figured everyone did this months ago and only a select few would wait till the very last minute.

Yes. Just being a passport if you a have one.

You need an appointment.
It was announced in 2005. Yes they kept pushing it back but 20 years is a long time to have figured it out. Not trying to be rude but 20 YEARS.
That sucks. My Real ID expires in the fall.
Had it so long that it‚Äôs expiring soon and never needed it (yet)
I have a passport, so I don't necessarily need a Real ID, but I have no choice about getting my license renewed, anyway, this spring."

Go to Voter Registration Office. If you are registered as a party. You can not change at Primary.
You can find fairly [everything you need right here](https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/vote.shtml). The NJ Voter Information Portal.
Try DMV if you need to get a new license or Real-ID. I changed mine when I went a couple weeks ago
You can do it online or declare it at the primary when you go to vote. I've done both, at different elections.
Go to your county website. Look for voter registration forms. Affiliation there. Do in advance. Like now.
When I renewed my license I was able to change mine.
Pollworker here! As an independent you can show up at the primary and tell the pollworker which primary you want to vote in. That will automatically register you to that party. 

You can also go to your county Board of Election's website. They should have the form you can fill out to change your registration. Or you could always show up in person and they'll walk you through it.
Search the Google for your County and 'change party'.  In Camden County we had to fill out a form (print or online and print) and mail it to the Board of Elections.
Oh yes, I remember when I did this 8 years ago.
Since you are an independent you can do it when you walk into vote on election day. Just tell them the affiliation you'd like and they will hand you the right ballot. I was a registered independent and declared in 2008 because I wanted to vote in the presidential primaries.
As long as you're registered to vote in time, you just show up to vote in the primary election. You're only allowed to vote in one party's election. You can choose which one you want, and then voting in it enrolls you in that party for the year (and beyond if you don't do something to change it, like a request to be removed or simply voting in a different party's primary election another year).
You can change it right there, day of the primary
It's so easy to do online now, just did it last week so I can vote in the primary.  For years I was an independent, but its easier at the poll if you have the party affiliation.
https://voter.svrs.nj.gov/register I just did this today so I could sign a petition
Yeah, because they're independent they can choose an affiliation on the primary election day. Someone already affiliated to a party has to wait 55 days after switching to another to vote in the new party's primary.
If you are ‚Äúunaffiliated‚Äù you can declare in person on primary day. If you are registered as ‚Äúindependent,‚Äù then you need to change party registration 55 days before the primary.
is that the rule for independents? because that is an official political party
Correct
That's only if you aren't already registered. If you're registered as an Independent, you don't have to change anything. When you vote in the primaries, say you're a Democrat, then change it back to Independent again after you voted. I know because I checked about a week ago. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to vote in the primaries, too, because I'm registered as an Independent.
Yes I meant to say unaffiliated
Same
And then they can switch back to being unaffiliated by mailing or hand delivering [this form](https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/assets/pdf/forms-party-affiliation/party-affiliation-form.pdf) to their county board of elections after the election is certified
Independent and Unaffiliated are different things.
That‚Äôs true about at the polls, but untrue about the already registered on the site. You can change party affiliation on that site - I know, because I‚Äôve done it before.
This is true for in-person voting, however, In morris county, if you‚Äôre signed up to vote by mail for the primary election, you need to be affiliated in order to receive your mail-in ballot.
Wait 2 questions:

1. Say I'm a democrat when I go to vote in the primaries (I am an independent) or should I tell them I am independent and am declaring as a democrat?

2. How do I find where to vote in the primaries?
Thank you for letting me know. I tried several times, but was unable to. That's why I thought you couldn't.
Say you are unaffiliated and ask for the Dem ballot.  This means your party affiliation will change. You can change it back about 2 weeks post election https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/voter-party-affiliation-declaration.shtml

Can they fill in just that area of the mine? Or build a bridge? I feel bad for the Avalon residents. Tho if they did their research they would have known to never live in an Avalon place
Oh hey, don't take I-80 West. Or East.
3rd one
I guess this makes me feel slightly better about my rt23 commute that has doubled
I know exactly where that is. That's the Hibernia/Rockaway sign.

Hope you got home safe!
I've completely lost track of all these sinkholes....
No worries, ""Infrastructure Week"" is coming up any day now.
Upcoming summer fun for the Pocono clan üëè
Can the governor declare a state of emergency for situations like this? If so, has he or why hasn‚Äôt he?
Should have gotten off at Denville and headed for Green Pond Rd. Granted, at that time of day both 80/15 and 23 are fucked.
Must be a day that ends in 'y'.
Lol this read as someone affluent pitying the poor.
Is this by the Rockaway exit? Where did the traffic start?
New York 2.0
Already 3 hours, does it ended?
I use to live right off that next exit in Rockaway Boro. You guys are certainly helping me NOT miss it üòÆ‚Äçüí®
That's my exit. So happy to have retired last July. It really sucks out there and will for a very long time. OK, it's fucked up.
Where? Slightly east of Wharton? Or farther off than that?
I was on 287. It as great since no one was going to 80.
I‚Äôm so sorry. Dealing with this too.
Sucked today. I was stuck there yesterday also. I went around but still hit traffic on other highways/side roads.
I‚Äôm making shirts and selling the during traffic
I take 1&9 onto 80W towards Teterboro. Normally 45 minutes from Jersey City but recently it‚Äôs been a lot less. Feel bad for the folks dealing with the sinkhole business
When i was younger the congestion stopped at 287, then Rockaway now Netcong???
I wonder if having people work from home would help reduce the wear and tear on the roads, and reduce traffic. Too bad that will never work out for no apparent reason.
Where on 80?
For those who take Lakeland Bus Lines from points WEST of the Rockaway Mall:  I just called their office this morning (Friday) asking if they are planning to further curtail service given that both directions are now closed. 

Their reply was that they are considering to temporarily designate the Rockaway Mall as the western terminus until the situation is resolved.  For those who normally hop on the bus to the PABT from Sparta, Newton, Netcong, Stanhope, or Howard Blvd would be required to drive to the Mall.  I board the bus from Howard Blvd and will be taking the train if that will be Lakeland‚Äôs decision by Monday.
You need to look at the positive around you... 

 Don't have...... tunnel vision.
We should all just get some shut eye

New sinkhole now on 287 near Parsippany.
I wonder if all these sinkholes have anything to do with the earthquake last year.
Of course, it's sinkhole related! Spent an hour among these vehicles on Wednesday night...5:30. Hope nobody gets ill or has to go to the bathroom while sitting in this.
Join the club
The sinkhole? Right
But yea soge checks are the top priority right now ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥
Ummm‚Ä¶.pretty good actually cause I am against NYC traffic, and they let us go one hour early today because of the sinkhole, so all in all, today was somewhat easier than any other day üò¨
Taking the train.. but so expensive!
My commute was great. 30 second walk from the bedroom to my home office. Minor traffic in the kitchen, was slightly delayed and had to stop to slap my wife's bum. Almost late to work
This is probably all a ploy by Bill Gates and Obama to force people to use mass transit.
Driving is stupid
It is sinkhole related actually
[removed]
You win
Similar here, Wantage to Somerset or Chatham. I take 206 all the way down past Chester, or take 23 to 287. Even if my GPS says rt-15 to 80 is the best way to go, i don't believe it.
I feel your pain. My commute isn‚Äôt exactly the same but I commute from sinkhole territory to Somerset County lol.
Geez you commute was already fucked¬†
That communeted gonna be long and fun.
What up, neighbor!
This video begins where 15 north and south enter I 80 east. It runs until driver exited in Denville. The back up was far longer than what this shows. Going to be the same, every week night for who know how long. It's a freaking mess and a half. It's going to hurt a lot of small businesses along this corridor. I just told my wife no take out except on weekends due to having to cross this mess.
Wow.
Was glad I had Waze up and saw the line of red up to Oak Ridge, got right off 23 and only got home 10 mins later.

My morning commutes have already been stretched almost an hour longer. Gonna start avoiding 23 I think
Absolute nightmare up to Berkshire Valley today. 40 minutes to get from 287 to the s curves.
Normally takes about an hour from fairfield to Vernon. Eventually I left 23 to go the back way.... like everyone else. Nearly 2 hours to get home last night
üò±
One of the reasons I have no intention of driving on that road for a long time.
Don't drive on [287 either.](https://abc7ny.com/amp/post/2-lanes-287-northbound-closed-sinkhole-opens-parsippany-troy-hills/16064514/)
I already lost my CPA to it. He informed me in a letter a few months ago that he would no longer be commuting from PA to Northern NJ. Why?  Sick of the commute.  He told me how much longer it was now--can't recall exactly what he said but it was over an hour extra.
I bought a house last year right off that exit. The commute was borderline but it was all we could afford so it seemed worth it. Took me two hours to get home yesterday. I get a sinking feeling (lol) that this is not going to be fixed anytime soon and there will be no workaround.
It sure is, and it's going to hurt property values. A lot of people in Western NJ commute to Bergen County and NYC for work, and this just added 1+ hours to their commute. It's not an attractive place to move to right now, and there's no indication this problem is going to end any time soon.
Same here
I live in Essex County and already cancelled our annual trip to the Poconos.  We thought of taking 78 into PA and then cutting back north on 33, but didn't feel it was worth the extra hassle.
That's the dream.
 Construct subways in the busiest parts of the state and use the dirt they have to take out to fill up the abandoned mines.
Robust Trains are the answer
triple tracking, electrification, less than 15 minute intervals, up zoning within a 15 minute walk of every station and revival of abandoned lines. Walking trails are nice but we need to move people
Imagine how much land we could use for housing!
I‚Äôm sorry but that is considered domestic terrorism, you haven‚Äôt thought of the Teslas that need those roads.
It would be ok ish, if the earthquake didn't collapse a bunch of old abandoned mines that were directly under the interstate.

Thanks Eisenhower, lol.
No shot. They will repair these sinkholes in the next couple of months and everyone will forget about this and keep buying.
Interesting take. I live two exits east of the construction.. if this goes on for a while, I can definitely see house prices going up
One can dream
Thats just into Rockaway
West of Rockaway Mall in Wharton. A few yards from the Wharton, West Bound exit 34A.
By the Rockaway Mall
I wouldn't be surprised if 78 eventually has the same problems given that it's only separated from route 80 by about 25 miles.
I thought about that when I was on 46 to avoid 80
I do the exact same commute but only 2 times a week. I‚Äôll be looking into taking the train those two days though.
That's the current problem.  The ""plan"" to mitigate just failed.  There are now sinkholes on both sides so road is 100% closed....and they haven't even begun to work on the ""plan"" to actually fix it.
I did, thanks!
that's ok, they completely lost track of all those mines
He has.
The boro has been a mess of displaced drivers trying to find alternate ways through all day. Picture how shitty the middle of town is at rush hour then double it.
Hope you didn‚Äôt have to wait too long in traffic.
Thanks Obama
Yes, a new sinkhole opened yesterday evening. It is located on the median where they were trying to make the crossover lane.
It's definitely sinkhole related
No it‚Äôs actually the sinkhole. They now found one on 80 westbound so both sides of 80 are shut down now. Has nothing to do with trump at all no matter how hard you guys wish it did.

[link](https://newjersey.news12.com/njdot-all-lanes-closed-on-i-80-in-wharton-due-to-sinkhole) 

Does no one read the news?

I live close to this whole mess and all I can tell everyone is to avoid 80 completely for the next year or so. It‚Äôs going to take a loooong time to fix this massive mess. Murphy just declared state of emergency to get federal funding to help fix it. My friends sister works for the DOT and their estimate is 1 year to fix it.
Guhh if true ü§¨
Berkshire Valley GC must be super popular
Thank you, forgot about that, just added it to the description
Its so rough. I live in sussex County and work in carlstadt, my commute is almost 2 hours in the morning.
Im in that area, I have no choice but to either take 23.. or 80. Im regretting moving here right now
I feel so bad for the folks who live on BVR, trying to navigate going into/out of your own driveway!!
Oh damn I didnt even think of how that area would be.
It's been a terrible commute going back to the ads on NY TV luring renters to the Poconos. It's an hour with no traffic.
No way for him to work remotely?
Agreed.  My commute was an hour each way.....now it's 2. The news and whispers coming out on the sinkhole and it's fix don't sound good.  I don't think they have any idea of what to do at this point.   The answer may be re-routing the highway or a bridge or who knows....but they arent quick fixes.  Looks like a 5-10 year problem.  Not good
Exactly how im feeling. Lake hopatcong block party is in may and even though there are alternates to get there besides 80, it might not be worth it. Then with the poconos I dont want to deal with this mess plus the traffic by the S curve by the DWG
That would be a huge waste of taxpayer money! 


Now ziplines ....

I sincerely doubt the earthquake had anything to do with this. In the scheme of things it was still only a minor one. There is far more shaking on the regular coming from the munitions testing at the base.
I like your optimism!
Exactly.  Just like everyone was going to sell their shore homes after Sandy.  People forgive and forget very quickly.
not if the drones kill us first.
Do you realize how wide and deep these are.  Estimated at 700-1400 feet deep.  Potentially 100 feet wide.  This is a big problem.  5-10 years not months
I am betting next summer all lanes are open.¬† It's been 4 months to pretty much waste everyones time and pay the construction workers for nothing.


The bridge over 15 will also need to be rebuilt.¬† The mt arlington bridge will take 3 years and is obviously a money milking project.¬†¬†


If milked this could take 3 years but a year if done with actual motivation.
I'm the exit before this mess

![gif](giphy|14vTnFcC3Oom4M)

JK I'm broke
I'm exit 37. I take 287 to 80 home and say in this as it was just starting to back up right after the denville exit. I might try and take 287 to route 10 for a bit and see if that is any better
I wouldn't be surprised either.
I believe it! My driveway was on (suppose it still is) Hoagland Ave. Anytime 80 was a mess, the quarry trucks increased and traffic would back up past my house. I imagine it‚Äôs simply a nightmare with the sinkholes and people trying to cut through town. :/
Thanks! It hasn‚Äôt been too bad. I live right near 80 am exit away from all this mess so my commute is bad when I‚Äôm just leaving and just getting home. ü´†
Sorry, sinkhole 1 was so good we had to do a sinkhole 2
Stop really? When will it end!?
Anddddd... Here is another on [287,](https://abc7ny.com/amp/post/2-lanes-287-northbound-closed-sinkhole-opens-parsippany-troy-hills/16064514/) this time.
Good luck with that Federal funding ...
Great course! Bowling green right across town as well
i do wonder if this will affect them during the week which is when i generally play there
I live in Sussex too, about 1.5 hr drive currently closer to 2 lately but work a little closer than you. But it‚Äôs a 40 min drive.

I worked throughout Covid, being only car on the road (including police) on 23 was the best driving experience I‚Äôve had, could get to work in 30 mins
Im also in that area and work in Carlstadt. Sometimes I look at that train line and wonder why the fuck I cant take one to Secaucus or East Rutherford
Are you near Oak ridge? Yea right now that‚Äôs turned into a horrible spot for commuting. Usually isn‚Äôt too bad
I don't know about that. Things were rocking for well over a minute during the earthquake so I could see that affecting the mineshafts. Then the drought could have made things worse as the ground dried out.
Until the next sinkhole.
Yup! The amount of men and women working on this 24/7 is extremely impressive and honorable. No shot this is taking years to repair and they will continue to buy up all the properties on rt 15.
Everyone forgot about them already. We knew they were coming from Picatiny and would receive no info on them.

Considering i am .20 miles from the sink hole and get to talk to the fine people who work on this issue daily. I‚Äôll go with what they are telling me.
Pay the workers for nothing? These guys are working like crazy to get that highway open for you as fast as possible. They are only getting 15% extra to work nights. They are not miracle workers and you are grossly underestimating the magnitude of this problem. This is going to be a long process. A game of whack a mole, so to speak. I hope I'm wrong.
It took us thirty-five minutes, at three p.m. to drive from Sanders Rd. to Pondview on 15. Richard Mine Rd. is a mess. And they have existing sinkholes too. Good times huh?
Sorry to hear that. Just hope it can be fixed soon, but seeing how another one opened up. It‚Äôs not looking likely
Isn't this sinkhole 3?
Sinkhole 2: Electric Boogaloo
We've had sinkhole, yes, but what about *second* sinkhole?
[deleted]
When 80 leads direct to Beijing
They already had offices set up on the eastbound side as though they'll be there for some time. Now westbound has angered our planet.
You think this is bad ? Wait till Sink Hole De Mayo !
North of Kinnelon was just straight crime during covid I miss it so much.
It bothers me to no end that NNJ has no rail connection. Id much rather pay $ to take a train than spend a boat load on gas and commute 500 miles a week
Yup thats exactly where I live lol
Remind me in 6 months
what have they said? Cause originally this was gonna be about a month when it first happened. Hard to take a timeline seriously when new problems keep popping up
I said it could be 3 years to get everything back to normal, underestimating the project would be saying it could take 6 months to a year, no way.


They deserve their pay they just do what they are told.¬† I'm not an expert but anything less than blasting and filling is just a band aid.¬† The web of tunnels could be too much to hunt and peck.¬† Until now they were playing dumb.¬† It was a matter of time till the highway would close.¬† ""what luck, the mine was only under one side of the highway""
Definitely not ideal everyday that's for sure
I thought sinkhole 2 was the same as sinkhole 1 only bigger and better.
Nah, it's

Sinkhole (remake)

Sinkhole's Revenge

Gosh! Do you not even READ the lore? üßê
It  was wild to me that they built Avalon there; almost like they were willfully not looking at the ground history but were can also say that for 80 in this area . Such a mess.
Ayyyy
There it is
I had bought a 2015 GT-R at the beginning of 2020 before the shutdown, I was in heaven on 23 lol. Think about it every time I sit in the parking lot that is 23 nowadays. Didn‚Äôt see a cop for months
Totally agree. I used to take the train back in the day all the time. It's nice being in a car but for long commutes I'd rather be a little longer but not have to worry about my surroundings and read a book or¬† nap
Time to invest in a helicopter
If I‚Äôm wrong I owe ya a beer. But this was just updated last night if you care to read. I think we will be good mid summer.

NJ DOT report that i posted earlier in this thread has some really nice updates. Im tired of relaying the info and talking about this now. Just visit thag site daily as they make tons of updates weekly.
They don't even know how to fix it.  They were simply building a way around it.  Now that is out the window.  They have no idea
Since it's the same mine shaft, it's all going to be the same sinkhole eventually.
We'll all get burned when they release New Sinkhole but we'll come crawling back for Sinkhole Classic.
Nope, three sinkholes now. I drove right by the new spot a couple of hours before it opened. It's freaking nightmare. Who knows what's next?
The current mayor was on the Planning Committee among other things and was involved with the remediation of the site by the developer prior to building that place. I just saw him on tv standing near the building which hosted a five hour, visual inspection. Everyone deems it to be fine. Except for the tenants. It's a mess and killing some businesses already.
The wharton mayor was on the planning board when that place was built he knew about the mines (admitted it on news twelve) but blamed the road work on 80 for all the cracks in the building not the possible sink hole developing under the apartment building 
New Jersey the most corrupt state 
Not the garden state
Poor folks that live there are going to wind up with basement apartments even if they live on the top floor.
1000% agree. Ive been looking for a new job due to the commute, and this all makes my search all the more needed.
Ive entertained it, I work by Teterboro airport. Either that or a lawn chair tied to 1000 balloons
yeah i checked that link, its nice to see progress but theres no real time line listed either. Its all up in the air which I understand, but I dont have hope that it will be done by the end of the school year.
So long as the Knotty Pine holds on.
Didn‚Äôt realize the Avalon was having issues. Makes sense. Disliked liked it since it was being built.
And quarter inch ceiling heights
Totally, I'm gonna try to pivot wfm but I know it's not gonna happen. I better start looking

Black Magic Bakehouse in Ridgewood!! They‚Äôre completely sourdough based and have a variety of breads and pastries
Second for Liv! They make a traditional sourdough round for $9 and it's perfection. We pre-order and specifically ask in the notes for one that's not too well done because they tend to sell out by the time we get there in the afternoon (and if there are any left in the afternoon, they're the well-done ones.) They also make a delicious sourdough loaf that's denser than the traditional sourdough round and shaped like a loaf of bread but beware that it's saltier.
Ridiculously good. We make a pilgrimage from  Morris County and freeze off sliced loaves of their sourdough; it‚Äôs well worth the visit, and their pastries are also sublime."

This is a strange post. I am all about ice cream and been to most mentioned. I've also been making my own ice cream for years and come to really respect places that focus solely on unique flavors and originality without relying so much on novelties, trends, or nostaglia. With that said, Surprised Francy's got knocked out early and really really disappointed that Milk Sugar Love isn't even on this. Based on some of these choices, you'd at least think Nasto's or Torico's should be on here.
I'm gated from the website for whatever reason, but I've lived all around NJ and Cliffs really deserves the win
They do this same bracket every year and it‚Äôs always Cliffs at the end. At least there‚Äôs finally a shake up. 

We‚Äôre only a few weeks away from another bracket telling us White Manna has the best burgers and then the hot dog one where Rutt‚Äôs Hut wins.

ON3 - Redevelopment of Ex-Hoffman La Roche Campus,"I searched and didn't see any posts on this subreddit, so I'm curious what people know and think?  I've driven on the campus a couple times (mostly as a shortcut to Rt 3), and it's a strange area. They are still trying to develop this, and looking at the website, [ON3](https://on3nj.com/vision/) is having difficulty getting approval to build residences here, in addition to what they already have.

According to the site, the development is meant to be focused on hosting workplaces that center around the life sciences, as well as having retail and entertainment, and eventually living spaces.  They make it appear as if it's for the local community, but it looks like it's aiming to be more of a communal / work space where people can just kind of live and work in one place.  Maybe I'm wrong on that, but wondering if anyone knows more than what's already out there?

I wonder if there are any environmental issues, or people should be concerned living there being that it used to be a pharmaceutical location and likely had labs, etc.  There are still piles of rubble where some buildings were torn down, but there are brand new buildings currently occupied by some companies, including Hackensack Meridian.

Yeah, it‚Äôs funny how they go after teachers making an average $75,000 salary in this school district.  They complain about 40 dollar increase on their taxes.
That is a lot of taxes. Like what are you getting for that rate? I think there is a lot of financial mismanagement if you need to pay $40k annually in taxes. In my town a $1.7 m home pays about $21k in property taxes for a top school district. What are all of you doing down in Montgomery? Something seems wrong to me. I am going to go compare school test scores, be back to see how we stack up. Ok, they are paying 2x the rate for worse scores. You need to clean house.
Which is what they should make for the amount of work they do
Typically, these houses sit on 1 to 2 acres of land.¬† Also, I believe a lot of the town works for Bloomberg, J&J, and Black Rock.¬† The taxes are high because historically, these people wanted great education for their kids, as they probably did.¬† Again, the house is valued at $1.8 million which is 2.4% of it's value.¬† By comparison, a $500k would be $12k.
Yeah, and NJ average is 2.33%, so that's incredibly reasonable, all things considered.  I say that paying 3.8% here in lovely Somerville.  But you know what?  Like 60% of that goes to schools, which I'm always glad to pay for.  But a rate of 3.8% on that 1.8m house is 69k, which is *a lot of money*.

We‚Äôre concerned with the rising sea levels and risk of flooding before buying property. 

We really like Point Pleasant Beach, so any specific streets / areas in that town that get the most flooding would also be helpful know. From my own research, it seems like around Little Silver Lake gets some flooding after rainstorms. 

Any insight on the above would be greatly appreciated, thank you!!

Well, it‚Äôs the shore and most of it is barrier islands. All the towns flood. Buy one that‚Äôs raised and get good insurance.
Look at the FEMA maps while they still exist.
Buy a house that‚Äôs already been lifted/built above the requisite height for insurance purposes.  Also, keep aware of high and low tides and the moon phases.
in PPB any place east of the railroad tracks can be under water in a hurricane. Most houses in those areas have been lifted now. There is a flood zone map here somewhere:

[https://pointpleasantbeach.org/165/Floodplain-Management](https://pointpleasantbeach.org/165/Floodplain-Management)
I lived in Pt. Pleasant for 10 years. Water doesn't drain like it does it in North Jersey but it doesn't flood down there unless there is a MAJOR storm event. If you want absolute piece of mind buy a raised home.
Avoid Sea Bright
Library section of pt beach is beautiful and is very dry. Pricey tho.
Would you add an inflatable thick plastic lining into your basement so it covers the walls and floor and prevents water from coming through? It‚Äôs like a waterproofed basement but the water will always be outside of the plastic lining.
This is a great resource
Every street near the elementary school is dry.
Thank you! Are you aware of any streets east of the train tracks that get more flooding than others? Or is it pretty consistent throughout?"

Recommendation for a place to live,"Hello everyone. My wife and I are going to move to NJ, for my job which will be in Iselin, in a few weeks. I am not familiar with good towns and places to live in NJ so I am looking for recommendations. We do not possess a car yet so that might be something to note, but we plan to get one eventually.",0.27,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jftzq2/recommendation_for_a_place_to_live/,15,1jftzq2,2025-03-20 17:13,"r/movingtonewjersey
You need to stay on the Islein train line if you don‚Äôt have a car. Otherwise it‚Äôs a huge pain. Our public transit is less than desirable.
Iselin is right smack dab in the middle of Edison and Woodbridge.  It‚Äôs also got a NJ Transit station in the middle of it.  Depends on how long of a commute you want to have. Surrounding areas Westfield, Clark, Carteret, Avenel, Edison (Huge area), New Brunswick (train station), Rahway (train station).  Some of these towns have nice areas and some not so nice.  Planning on buying a home or renting?
Iselin has experienced a lot of vertical residential construction these last couple years and if you check its NJ transit train station (Metropark) is also getting a gigantic makeover, as they are building housing adjacent to it (next to other things!). I am guessing your job will be in the giant conglomerate of office buildings in front of Metropark, if you can get an apartment in one of these places at Iselin and you could prob be at bicycling distance! If you/when you get a car you could expand your search way farther!
Thanks, will post there as well, but if somebody here has some advice feel free to help out :)
Yeah I can see that, I come from a town that has everything connected via busses so the lack of transportation is really odd to me :D
Definitely renting for now, as I am not sure how long we are going to stay, as my job may require me to move out in a year or so. I will not have to commute every day, so even if it's a tad longer to do so it's not an issue. My wife loves to walk around, so a place with lots of things close by would be good, where we can go to places without needing a car (stores, restaurants, city center, gym, etc..). 

Not sure if we are looking for a unicorn here :D
Yeah, it will be very close by to Metropark, so finding a place there might not be a bad idea.. Only not sure how many supermarkets and other things (like cafees, restaurants, etc) we have close by so will have to check that out. Thanks for the recommendation and info!
That‚Äôs hard when you haven‚Äôt provided any info outside the location of your job and that you don‚Äôt have a car (yet). What‚Äôs your income? Kids? Planning on having kids? Looking to rent? Buy? Do you want to be in the middle of nowhere? When will you get a car? Do you want to bike to work? What‚Äôs your budget? How long do you want your commute to be?
Best thing to do in the area is to rent a car and drive around in the area. There‚Äôs a lot to see.
I apologize, first time looking for advice on this matter, didn't know what was important to state. 

I have a \~100k income myself, my wife doesn't work, and we do not have kids, but plan to do so in a few years but not sure if we will be staying here long term or not because of my job.   
We are looking at rentals only for now.   
We would not prefer to be in the middle of nowhere, as my wife is used to living in a city where she could just walk everywhere so someplace where things are in walkable distance would be good.   
We plan to get a car in a month or two, depending on what we can find.   
I would not prefer to bike to work, no.   
I am note sure how prices go here, so I do not have a tight budget, but something around 2.5k I guess if I had to put a price down.   
Commute time is not that important, since I will be going there only a few times a week (usually once or twice).

Hope this clear's things up a bit :)
That can also be a good idea to do. You mentioned that some of these towns have nice areas and some not so nice, what did you mean by that if you don't mind me asking?
2.5k is on the border of being a tight budget for NJ if you want enough space to have kids within a few years. You‚Äôre also going to need a car unless you live in Hoboken or Jersey City (which you won‚Äôt be able to do for 2.5k)
Yeah, for now, I am not thinking about kids, when we get to that point I will be looking to upgrade :D Also, I guess there is a trade-off between living in a city without a car but paying more for rent or living within a city that requires a car but has a lower rent... Just have to figure out what is financially better in the end"
NJ State Refund,did anyone receive their state refund yet ?? I filed on the 27th of January it‚Äôs been 7 weeks like what the fuck..,0.31,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jfty2i/nj_state_refund/,26,1jfty2i,2025-03-20 17:11,"You will get it
I made a post about this a lot of people who filed and were accepted at the end of Jan may need to call and verify to have their refunds released like I did I was accepted 01/29 stuck on processing for almost 6 weeks so I called and I had to verify some information from my return certain lines and amounts and my banking info she said my refund was released and that was 03/13 and by 03/15 I updated with approved and a deposit date for 03/20. May not be the case for everyone but you never know a lot of people after seeing my post have called and had to also verify and are now getting approved so I would call. They aren‚Äôt sending any letter to the people who need to verify that why I made a long post about it how else would we know it‚Äôs really messed up that they aren‚Äôt sending any notices . Here are the number I called and I kept calling till I got through.

(609) 292-6748
Yeah, got mine a few days ago
Got mine 2 days ago. Filed around end of Feb.
I filed the first day you could and only just got mine last week. They‚Äôre taking their time!
I filed at the end of January, mine was deposited March 11.
You can check the status of your refund [here](https://www16.state.nj.us/TYTR_TGI_INQ/jsp/prompt.jsp)
My daughter, who just filed 2 weeks ago, got hers today, but I filed at the end of January and am still waiting.
Got mine on the 18th.
Been on processing for WEEKS now. Going to call tomorrow.
Filed 1/31 still processing. I kept calling and they say it doesn‚Äôt appear on their end that I need documents or to verify. I uploaded documents anyway just in case. I have called a few times a week for 6 weeks now. No change. But I also have eic and I‚Äôm not sure if that has anything to do with it.
I called this morning at 8 a.m., and the representative asked me to verify my account and routing number. Once I provided that information, she was able to approve my request over the phone. She confirmed that I should receive my refund by next week.
Filed 2/3, got refund 3/7
So I filed on 1/31 and never received my state refund. I called the state yesterday and was told that I had to upload documents, which I did. I received an email that said to allow 90 days for the division of taxation to review my response. Has anyone else got that? I was under the impression that once I uploaded documents the process would move rather quickly.
I finally got in touch with them via the (609) 292-6400 and hitting prompt 5 from the main menu. It went exactly as you had mentioned. I needed to verify name, social, and various dollar amount from specific lines on the NJ return, as well as direct deposit information. Unreal they they arent sending out letters to people whose returns are hung up like this.


I have been stuck on processing forever as well. Tried calling today but they close at 4PM. Plan on calling first thing in the morning and will post an update. I have never had to call to get anything verified or released so this seems out of the ordinary. Thanks for posting this though I probably would have waited a couple of more weeks before I picked up the phone.
I do it‚Äôs been on processing for 6 of the 7 weeks
what number did you call?
Same here. I filed on 1/29. Called on 3/18 and was told the same. Still in the ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù stage
I called as well but they didn‚Äôt say I need to verify anything they just told me to continue to wait basically and something bout Eic
Oh, then yeah you should probably call and ask if there's a problem. I filed Feb 26 and got my refund this week.
609-292-6400
Just checked the status, got approved with DD date of 4/1
That is annoying.
Just give it more time if you don‚Äôt hear back call back I had to call back twice before they told me I needed to verify kept telling me to wait for processing

You have to be somewhat specific about your request.   You can just ask for ""information about a dude.""  You can ask for disciplinary reports, for example, with the understanding that some information can be classified as ""personnel related"" and therefore will not be released. 

You can anonymously request public records by going to: [https://opramachine.com/](https://opramachine.com/)

Select the jurisdiction (you can make requests to both the Township in general and to the Police Department specifically).  Fill in the other info and the web site will send the request to the appropriate custodian of records on your behalf.  When a response is received you will be notified.  Also note that the responses themselves will be posted to the Opramachine web site.
Go to the towns / departments website and look for ""OPRA Request""

Great suggestions! I didn't know Morris County had a glass blowing studio. We're both really into the show Blown Away on Netflix, so maybe he'd be into trying it himself since it's so athletic and physical

I support people saying ""let them hate"" because I certainly didn't GAF for a long time. But as someone living out of state temporarily, it's a bit frustrating and sad to be told that everything you love and grew up with is trash.
I'm convinced that it's because of New York's media having a widespread cultural impact. It's common for people in one local area to have a rivalry of sorts with their neighbours. For New York, that neighbour is New Jersey. The rest of the country, hearing jokes about New Jersey being terrible and knowing nothing about the state, believes that NJ is awful. Of course we, living here, know better than that.
People hate on NJ and then when they try to explain why they describe Long Island
I was just in Utah snowboarding. On the elevator in the airport, someone asks, ""where are you from""? I respond, ""New Jersey"". Then I get a ""Oh, Joisey?""

No. It's fucking JER-sey. We don't all have whatever that accent is.
The best way to spot an ignoramus is when they describe the state as a massive trash dump oil refinery landfill. 

Tell me you haven‚Äôt been outside the airport radius without telling me you haven‚Äôt been outside the airport radius.
Let them hate us. The hate sustains us. We thrive on it.
As a transplant I can offer insight. I had a negative perception of NJ solely on the fact that I flew into Newark so many times and took transit to NYC. Newark is such a bad representation of Jersey it just soured what I thought of it.
Already too overpopulated. We don‚Äôt want more people here
Folks from Bumsfuckville, <insert random flyover state here> like to offer their condolences to folks who live in NJ, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Stay where you're at.
They hate us because they ain‚Äôt us
I don‚Äôt mind the hate‚Ä¶who‚Äôs hating? People from Wisconsin? Alabama? lol I‚Äôm good over here
I grew up from age 10-18 in the Midwest and there was definitely a negative view of NJ at the time. Jersey shore was popular back then that also painted a pretty trashy view of the state and its people. 

Having lived here for the past 15 years and commuting to nyc for the past 10, I can honestly say I don‚Äôt even think about other states and could care less about what they think of NJ. We at least have character here, not something I can say about most of the flyover states
100%. Also, hot take, but the NYC suburbs are not so bad. Dense walkable communities, really good public transit, a really strong local economy . . . like yeah if you're going to go live right next to like the ports in Bayonne or the Holland Tunnel it won't be so nice, but every developed area will have parts that are too industrial to be pretty, and traffic. That's just the cost of having a strong local economy.
Shushhh!!!! Please, let them continue to think they hate it!
It might sound cringe but they hate us cuz they ain‚Äôt us. Our state has done more for the country than any other. Not only do we feed the country but we have given light to read, cameras to film movies, radios to enjoy and that‚Äôs before we talk about the writers, poets, musicians and actors that came from this great state. They might act like they hate us, but they dream of being us.
I like Newark airport. I go through there a couple times a year and it's much better than some others I've been too.
Outsiders can shit NJ all they want, because we don‚Äôt need more people in NJ anyways. But it‚Äôs funny when people from some mid-west random states shit on NJ because for me, there‚Äôs only a handful states in the US I would live in besides NJ. I couldn‚Äôt care less about other states üòÇ

The shore towns are not great. And neither are the mountains. But they are convenient to the people living in the area. Like seriously, is NJ known nationally for beaches or skiing? No.

(Born in NJ and live in NJ. Grew up in California though, beaches aren‚Äôt remotely comparable and even mountains, CA has NJ edged out, even if neither is known for that)

Edit: you need to embrace what NJ is good at. Not what you want it to be good at.

I'd prefer they hate so they don't come.

It's already too expensive.
The 7 mile radius around Newark Airport isn't exactly putting our best foot forward (though it is critically needed infrastructure). The rest of New Jersey can remain our wonderful secret.
You fly into Newark take the turnpike see the refineries and that first impression is the be all and end all of judgement for the state. NJ is a great state with a lot of cultural assets beautiful scenery and beaches. North  central and south are very distinct and all have reasons to visit.
They hate us coz they anus
People confidently assume that they would hate it here and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

Fuck 'em. We're full anyway.
I miss NJ, but I'm glad I moved out. Those that don't understand the state though shouldn't hate it because it's popular to mock it or whatever. There are great things about NJ, it has a ton of stuff to do that's really close which brings all kinds of different things to do. Beaches, mountains, cities, small towns... all about an hour from each other. Right now I'm in Arkansas...not really by choice... life happens and everything is far away, and as an East Coast girl, there are no beaches so it makes me sad. 

I'm a Jersey girl, born and raised, no amount of southern will take that.
Let them think what they want.  We don't think of them at all.
Im ok with people hating our state, we got a lot to hate. Please, however, take 2 minutes of research and at least have reasons that actually describe the state.

Who cares? If you live here you know NJ is not Newark Airport or the crappy parts of the Sopranos opening, which is what everyone outside of this area thinks.  Let them think it, this state is overcrowded already.
The hatred was earned. North Jersey towards the New York City side is atrocious. You can‚Äôt go to like Clifton or Patterson or Newark even Trenton without finding destitute in overall shitty people. South Jersey is not without its faults either. You still have Camden Bridgeton Pleasantville, Atlantic City. If New Jersey didn‚Äôt have the large cities, it actually would probably be the most beautiful place on the map from the farms to the pinelands all the way up to the northwest mountains. Unfortunately, where New Jersey populates, ends up with a lot of scumbags.
We don't care
We don't care.
The people who ""hate"" it are just plain ignorant.   Their only experience of NJ comes from the show Jersey Shore, and flying into Newark Airport.  None of those things accurately represent NJ.

Don‚Äôt let foreigners see the beautiful parts of the state. We are full.
they are all just jealous
This is absolutely true. I spent the first 30 some odd years of my life growing up and living in NYC. I was brainwashed from the jump to believe NJ sucks and it's just a bunch of wannabe NYers who couldn't make it in the city. ""Everything's better over here, wtf do they have in Jersey besides the overwhelming smell of garbage everywhere?""

Found out it was all lies after I met my wife (lifelong Jersey girl), moved here and bought a home. I fucking love NJ and you couldn't make me move back to NYC if you paid me and gave me a free house. As a former brainwashed NYer, I'm sorry for all the shit I gave you guys in my earlier life. Just goes to show how powerful some propaganda can be when nearly everyone around you mindlessly feeds into it.
I saw a video where a guy says that all the hatred for NJ is because a lot of media comes from NYC, and they always talk shit about us.
also wait i wanna address every ‚Äúcon‚Äù op just threw out there

nyc suburbs: literally an unattainably desirable place to live

turnpike: expensive, but lmk when it backs up *without* an accident on the mainline or when you see any rutting and damage in the roadway from the crazy truck traffic - that‚Äôs right, you don‚Äôt.

parkway: legitimately the best highway in the state. non-NJ plates clogging the express lanes at *exactly* the speed limit are the worst part of the parkway.

newark airport: terminal A is wonderful now. as for B and C, they fucking work. i‚Äôve also never been in a nightmare security line at newark like i‚Äôve seen at jfk or miami. not even close. like they‚Äôre old and a bit dreary? ok. no one shits on the miserable international terminal in SuNnY MiAmI lmao.

pollution? welcome to the post-industrial northeast. don‚Äôt drink the tap water without filtration.
They hate us cause they anus
Shhh, don't tell anyone, we're full.
Shout out to High Bridge and the Spruce Run Recreation Area!
I was born & raised in North Jersey.  I moved to Chicago when I was 25 & have lived near Dallas for 25 years now.  No place comes close to NJ for a lot of things.  They can all suck it.  NJ is the Unites States 'hidden gem'.  Like others said in this thread, let the dumb@$$e$ thinks what they want.  NJ doesn't need them.  Keep it real & safe my Jersey homelanders!
Now that I'm a NJ transplant, let them think that. 

The state is full, we don't need more people coming here to jack up housing prices and property taxes.
I'm doing my part to make it as fairly hated as possible every day.
What's the most fairly hated state?
Its been that way since the founding of the country when Ben Franklin declared NJ as a Keg tapped at both ends
You are correct. SOUTH Jersey is the most unfairly hated state.
We like it that way, stay out please.
Let them hate it, it‚Äôs their loss.

Fine with me. Too many people already in on the secret.

But that‚Äôs just my opinion
Literally this, we're already incredibly expensive. Imagine if people knew how nice it really is?
Doesn‚Äôt matter the avg house is still ridiculously expensive.
Too late. Seems the whole world is moving to NJ. The secret's out and the housing crisis in this state is a testament to that.
Yes!

Keep those people out of the best sta...

 I mean the worse state yup
100% this. Once I realized this I gave up trying to fight it.
Can't agree with this statement enough.
Seriously- a friend was afraid of moving to NJ with her husband because she saw so much hate in TV shows. My jaw dropped a little since she is from Russia. üòÜ She only moved because he husband grew up in the area

That and because so many people fly in to Newark and then only see the Newark/Elizabeth industrial area as they head to NYC or elsewhere. Thus people just passing through only see the worst version of NJ and assume the entire state is like that.
Like in How I Met Your Mother, Ted hates Jersey. But he hates it because he lives in the cultural and economic center of the country and I would argue the world. If you want a city like that, New York is it. But if you live in Ohio like he's from originally, you have no room to talk about New Jersey the way he does.
I scrolled to find this. So much hate comes from New Yorkers that are on Long Island and the at place (minus the eastern tip) is terrible. Nothing to do but sit in traffic and talk shit on the superior neighbor that is NJ.
My late grandfather was a lifelong NJ-an (born and raised in Newark and later lived in Montclair for many years) and he would have certainly agreed.
I'm originally from Elizabeth. So for everyone who drives by exit 13 and 13A I get that part. But when I got older and had a delivery job 
delivering to all parts of the state-especially the super affluent parts of northeast NJ. No wonder more billionaires live there per capita than any other state. It's freaking beautiful in most parts.
Okay but when you fly into Newark and take the train to the city you quite literally do not see the anything other than the airport and the train. Like why would someone make a judgement about a whole state based off an airport and a single train line lol.
Yoy can go to a random strip mall in New Jersey and find a pizza joint and an Indian, Thai, or Chinese restaurant that is better than anything in their entire state.
Amen
It's no different from the dense inner ring suburbs of Boston, Chicago, DC, or Philly. Safe, walkable neighbors with plenty of character too.
Some of the neighborhoods in JC that are closer to the tunnel are still really nice. Some of those buildings right by the mall on the historic downtown side are great.
Exactly!
It‚Äôs not terrible at all. Especially the sections that have been facelifted!
I like this better than my post lol

Not just houses. I think NJ has the highest property tax too. Expensive houses + high prop tax is a great combo

\^\^Same. My husband grew up on Long Island. When we were dating, I told him I'd move literally anywhere with him EXCEPT Long Island. He pretends to hate that he's an NJ resident now but at least once a week he tells me how great it is here.
The woods out in the Delaware Water Gap are really gorgeous too
They said they had insight they didn't say it was extremely shortsighted
Facts.

Now, if only we could add more Mexican...
Terminal A is fantastic.
You're right. High taxes actually have two main benefits. They help provide decent infrastructure and services. Also despite what people think wealthy people actually benefit from high local taxes including property taxes because it provides a nice barrier of entry for the riff raff even though their offspring may not even attend public school.
They are kind of like a quasi country club.

The great right wing propaganda campaign of the last 40 years has been to get middle class and lower middle class people to complain about taxes above all else. What they should be complaining about is the 40-50% of their
waking hours of the week, with 2-3 weeks off a year, with little or no benefit jobs. This propaganda runs deep.
Basically --all government bad--all private sector good. We are about to see a crash course of how this philosophy works in real time. It will not.
We have high property taxes because we pay lower state and sales taxes than most states. I grew up in KS and $400k is the break point where you pay more in income tax in NJ in than Kansas. Add to that a higher sales tax and and local sales taxes as well. You'll pay less in SALT taxes in Kansas but not by the margin you'd expect and in return you get jack shit if you aren't in Douglas or Johnson counties.
I‚Äôm so glad we have amazing governor choices.. how fucking hard is it to rezone shit and start building???? Honest question
If taxes went down housing would just be more expensive. There are benefits and disadvantages to both but don't fool yourself into thinking NJ would be an affordable state if the taxes were lower. Reality is that the state is adjacent to two of the largest cities in the US and the cost of living is in line with every other area surrounding them.
I don't mind Long Island but it is a pain in the ass to get anywhere.
Some call zoning ‚Äúracist‚Äù but it‚Äôs more classists than anything. It really prices out regular people. Yet 25% of the state is currently paying 10k+ on home taxes‚Ä¶..
Oh makes sense so it‚Äôs all the same at the end of the day.  But still I disagree about the services you get, it‚Äôs very location depending in NJ but your property tax will still be high regardless of the location
Where is this magical land that you speak of within a reasonable commuting time of NYC?
Zoning is local.  The governor has absolutely nothing to do with how each locality zones their land.
From a beaurcratic standpoint where nobody violates their range of authority and jurisdiction? Actually tremendously.

The number of judicial reviews and governing bodies that you need to get approval from is STAGGERING, and then on top of that you need to have surveys upon reviews upon inspections, all of which can AND WILL be held up in court (often frivolous which still adds months to years to the review/survey/inspection in question, and then if you need multiple suits heard in the same district fucking forget about it, and that's BEFORE some of the issues get tied up as contingent upon the outcome of another result that's also in court) by any party that disagrees with the actions being taken.

I'm only about 25% of the way through the process, by the way. 

It is MUCH easier and faster if there's localized corruption and you can pay off a few key people to rubber stamp approvals/shut up and not object, but that goes against my original premises.
Zoning in NJ is handled at the municipal level.
Replying to Awatts2222...The average local property-tax bill in New Jersey rose last year to a record-high $10,095, according to the latest data released by the state. A year-over-year increase of nearly $300 pushed the average property-tax bill above $10,000 for the first time.

It's more than 25%.....

Good schools, jobs, super safe, low crime, great location, developed infrastructure, policies that promote quality of life.  You get that, or you get cheap.
Yeah--it's all pretty much a green zone.
A much larger percentage of school districts in NJ are good or great. So sure there are areas with worse schools, but those are more outliers than they are the standard. 

It's also worth noting that we actually pay for our shit too which is a major contributor to our high taxes. If NJ wasn't losing tens of billions a year to the federal government we'd get back more than our entire state income tax and then some.
You can get from Newark to  penn station  in like 25 min on train . If we expanded our rail nyc would be reachable from a very fat chunk of north jersey.
With the precedent , set by our the Fuhrer, we should be acting with balls like that and re work this system. People are pissed, and it‚Äôs better if we start a new process. But no one wants to approach that.
And of course no one has the balls to piss off whatever municipal goblins hold those Keys right? It‚Äôs like San Fran. Everyone wants to live there yet the residents of San Fran ALWAYS vote to not rezone..
They need way more infrastructure connecting into the city to make it worth it. The existing connections are already on the brink and making enough new connections would likely be ruinously expensive.
No, you can't at all. Maybe you meant Penn station, but not midtown
There is a certain bit of Ouroboros to this situation though. If you implement a system of circumventing the rules by circumventing the rules of the previous system, why on Earth would anyone observe the rules of the upcoming system?
Those members of your planning and zoning board are likely your neighbors.  Most P&Z boards are voluntary or that‚Äôs the deal with most I‚Äôve dealt with in my experience getting construction projects done in NJ and across the country.
Municipal goblins?
So what the fuck do we pay 16k on property taxes for then????
Am I dumb for thinking that NY Penn station is in midtown NYC?
You right. It‚Äôs still not a bad commute. On car it would take you atleast an hour.
Penn Station is in midtown.  The lowest part of midtown.
Instead of jumping hoops , change the law. Break the cycle and become effective. This is why republicans won.
I mean, I'm generally satisfied with my township. Streets are well maintained, my kid is thriving in the public school, we heavily utilize and enjoy the public parks and libraries, and we feel safe in our neighborhood.
Usually the bulk of your taxes pays for schools, especially if you are paying for a K-6 or K-8 local district and a separate high school, as a regional member or a sending district.
You're getting high property values in return. It highly likely that if they reduced the property taxes by half--the values would come down.
Your schools, probably.
>change the law. Break the cycle and become effective.

You're missing my point. What would prevent someone from just changing it again, either forwards or backwards, if the established precedents are not observed?

>This is why republicans won.

Republicans won because the overwhelming majority of Americans are both economically illiterate and staggeringly stupid.
You don‚Äôt understand. We are a self sufficient state. In fact we pay more into the government than we get back. We should be putting out these large infrastructure projects every other year.
Do something is the point. Anything to get shit to change. It‚Äôs a constant problem for years now.  We used to be a blue fortress and we‚Äôre slowly become purple. It‚Äôs a problem of inaction.
Blue states financially support red states, yet red states dispise us. Welcome to the US."
"Closing njezpass account, how do I stop them from charging me?",Later today I have to go to the newark customer service center to close my account because i need it closed by this weekend and I was wondering what I can do to make sure they don't charge me again?

They will either charge your transponder or your plate.
Take the EZPass out of/off your car.
They also take out maintenance fees.  All.  The.  Time.  Monthly?
Close the account from online, send the tags back then you will have to send in request again ask them to close your account for real after they received your tags. That was my experience.
I have already set up a NY ezpass with the same plate, do you think they'd still charge my Nj Ezpass account?
if your plates were\are in the system, its still going to likely associate a toll to you.

I guess the bigger question is why are you so concerned about getting charged for a toll this weekend and need the account closed so urgently.
I'll try this, I live near one of their customer service centers so I'll drop off the tags there and Im hoping that will close my account for good
I think if you have the NY E-ZPass transponder in the car while the NJ is in an antistatic bag, you should be safe.
If they double charge, you can dispute it easily.
I switched to NY ez pass for the pay per trip cause i go to brooklyn on sundays. I didnt like NJ ez pass cause they bumped my auto replenish from 25 to 140 in one go and i fear it'll only get worse so I wanted that account closed asap
Does NY ezpass still have no maintenance fee? My NJ one will charge me a small fee even I‚Äôm using a NY one"

Out of state trailer registration with title,"So I just bought a boat and trailer from MD. I have the title for both. I was able to title and register the boat with no issues, but they won't allow me to register the trailer because the title lists the vehicle weight at 3000 lbs. It's a 21' single axle trailer and they said that the weight listed is the combined weight of the boat and trailer, and that they need the unladen weight of the trailer itself. I asked where I could get it weighed and they said at a local gravel yard, recycling center, or scrap yard, then said these places have a way to give me the unladen weight with the boat still on the trailer. I thought that was a little weird. I asked how I could drive the trainer to the scale without tags and they said ""I'm sure you'll be fine."" What? So strange. I called around and asked if I could get it weighed with the boat still on and everywhere said no. I don't have anywhere to launch the boat and keep it tied up while I go weigh the trailer.

Its why you can find insane deals on used trailers. That person bought it cheap figuring he could get it through the system, and gave up and is now cutting his losses. He likely bought it from a guy who did the same thing too.

If its in good shape you might be able to get some OK cash from a smaller boat yard, who will use it around the yard or for parts.
It's very frustrating because I'm not missing anything and the title is not incorrect. I bought the boat and trailer in Maryland, got original titles for both all signed and dated properly, even had him go with me to get the bills of sales notorized. All legitimate. In Maryland they do not indicate the unladen weight on the title. I don't understand why NJ has to make it so difficult."
Urgent Housing Assistance & Free Legal Resources in NJ?,"

NJ Homeowner Assistance and Recovery Program (HARP) is Failing Disaster Victims,"It has been over three years since Hurricane Ida damaged my home, and the New Jersey Homeowner Assistance and Recovery Program (HARP) has completely failed to deliver on its promises to help homeowners rebuild. When I applied, I assumed HARP would coordinate repairs, assist with contractors, and help me get my home fixed. Instead, after conducting inspections and developing a scope of work, they placed the full burden on me to find contractors.

I have reached out to multiple contractors, including those on HARP‚Äôs own pre-approved list. Many don‚Äôt respond. Some outright refuse to take the job. Others visit, say they‚Äôll send a quote, and then never follow up. When I asked HARP what to do, their response was simply to ‚Äúkeep trying.‚Äù There is no alternative process for homeowners who can‚Äôt secure the required bids, even when the reason is contractor refusal rather than homeowner inaction.

My home still has major structural damage that I cannot fix‚Äînot because I haven‚Äôt tried, but because the system is broken. This isn‚Äôt just about me. If I‚Äôm experiencing this, how many other homeowners are in the same position? A disaster recovery program should be making it easier for homeowners to rebuild, not leaving them trapped in bureaucratic red tape for years.

I have filed complaints with the NJ Office of the State Comptroller and the HUD Office of Inspector General. I have reached out to elected officials, advocacy organizations, and the media. If a disaster recovery program is ineffective, who holds it accountable? Why is there no system in place to ensure homeowners actually receive the help they were promised?

Machine guy posing as a progressive. Made a mess out of Jersey City. Wife got a sweetheart deal on one of those legalized cannabis licenses. That said ANYTHING is better than a Republican.

Why did all the others cancel? Honestly this makes Steve Fulop look better to me because he isn't afraid to engage and meet with voters.
It‚Äôs **highly unlikely** that multiple teams confirmed attendance and then just failed to show. More likely, they never confirmed in the first place, and the organizers either assumed they would or didn‚Äôt properly follow up.

It‚Äôs frustrating when event planning isn‚Äôt handled properly‚Äîespecially when it reflects poorly on the organizers or the event itself.
He‚Äôs a shill for developers, hard pass.
Fulop has always been great in the accessibility/community outreach aspect. I used to work in JC and he was always in and out of the local businesses, spending money there, shaking hands. It always surprised me that in a city so big, he‚Äôd find time to be at ribbon cutting ceremonies for small businesses too. It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that he was the only one who showed up. He talks to his constituents and is within reach if you need his ear. Politics aside, from the times I‚Äôve met him, he seems like a pretty nice dude.
Was Gottheimer specifically disinvited? I thought nearly every mayor in NJ had endorsed him.

Platkin has been our best AG by far. He should stay on. Much better than Grewal who used it as a springboard to whatever he‚Äôs doing now.
Shouldn‚Äôt even be a point of contention. Platkin and Kim are both examples of the direction Democrats need to be going towards imho.

How has Platkin been a national leader on the fight against the Feds? And it‚Äôs been what 4 months? So nothing he did before is reason to keep him on?¬†
Looks like mikie Sherrill‚Äôs surrogate showed up,
Same. There are a couple candidates I mostly like and could live with, but Fulop really impresses me
It speaks volumes. Running for themselves,  not for us.
Fulop never does any public meetings in JC when there‚Äôs been a ton of quality of life issues that he needs to respond to. Enjoy the time while you get it during campaign season I guess.
Were they even invited?  Did they confirm attendance? I'm more disgusted by the false ""snubbing"" narrative.
OP isn‚Äôt saying no surrogate showed up. They‚Äôre saying no other candidate showed up. It was only Fulop and Mikie‚Äôs surrogate.
[deleted]
So good job OP?
I believe they had close to 300 people standing room only and 500 people on Facebook livestream.  It was actually one of the biggest events since it was hybrid.  Bergen also has a tough time with machine politics. The chair doesn‚Äôt invite anyone outside of the person they endorsed. And everyone knows this. So this was a huge missed opportunity for the candidates that didn‚Äôt show up. Honestly Sherrill‚Äôs surrogate seemed to be fangirling over Fulop by the end.
I feel like on this sub Fulop is a front runner because he‚Äôs seen as maybe the most progressive. But several people I know from Jersey City are‚Ä¶ not so fond of him. Of course that could be said about literally any mayor.
Did that dispensary ever open? I‚Äôm pretty sure nothing ever came of it.
Know some of his college friends. All are developers or commercial real estate brokers. They all speak very highly of him. These guys are north Caldwell rich MAGA heads. Fullop really pushed for development in jc which has turned it into a prosperous city, but at the costs of the people who are from there and have been there for generations. If you‚Äôve ever lived in JC you know that the PATH has been over crowded and god awful since the rapid increase in development. He may be a democrat but he is highly financially and power motivated. That said he‚Äôs ambitious and not a republican so that‚Äôs good but I trust him as much as a wet fart.
Considering the Machine hates him in Hudson county , is he really a machine guy?
Fulop‚Ä¶just another establishment centrist ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù Democrat.üí≤ü´èüí≤ü´è
I mean, just as the Democratic Party as a whole is ejecting ANY leftists thought for more centrist view points bc they think they can get that vote, you have someone running left of them at this point? There's gotta be more to that then just pandering... look at Beshear, and he's in a red state
Yeah, man, Jersey City. Real mess...
I live in Jersey City Heights and the police response time is atrocious. There is also absolutely no traffic enforcement.
The guy is fearless. He‚Äôs going on some conservative podcast in a couple of weeks. I thought that was pretty brave. That‚Äôs what I like about him. Fulop is always thinking outside of the box and doing something different. Everyone else sticks to the basics.  I feel with Fulop we have an opportunity to really see some positive changes. I feel like he knows how to do it. It‚Äôs exciting. Don‚Äôt wanna get my hopes up. But really hope he gets through the primary.
Cancelled last minute. Asked the organizer.
Organizers were shocked and upset.
I live in Journal Square. It‚Äôs a booming neighborhood with new businesses opening seemingly every other week and where tens of thousands of apartments, retail, and an entire park being built. It‚Äôs also the cheapest and nicest apartment I‚Äôve had anywhere in NJ or NY. Your POV is so deeply negative, I love this neighborhood and it was an absolute shit hole pre-Fulop.
Umm, I live in Jersey City and I thought they have done a great job salting the streets and clearing snow. Also, we each have to clear the snow off our section of the sidewalk, the city does not do that. And as for the homeless, they're in every urban city. The homeless population is actually much higher in Hoboken than it is in JSQ.
Attack Fulop where it matters but for some reason people are attacking Fulop in areas where he is actively trying to help. Journal Swuare was horrible for DECADES, it‚Äôs now seeing a resurgence. New construction is underway and that‚Äôs a GOOD thing because as we‚Äôve learned with Japan and Austin, new construction, even if it‚Äôs unaffordable, will drive down rent prices and housing prices. Jersey City has high rents not due to its own making but because of the fact that NYC wasn‚Äôt able to keep up with the influx of people.
This is wildly out of touch with how Journal Square has improved in the last 10 years.   Absurd comment.  There are numerous actual very valid reasons to attack Fulop for but this is some fantasy land bs that makes me question your actual intentions.
It was like that before he ever came into office. J.SQ is at least booming with more things coming
Who is the best candidate?
[removed]
What do you mean by breaking traditions and norms? Which ones are you talking about?
Your party has an unelected guy gutting the government, holy shit shut up LMAO
He went against Murphy and said the county line was unconstitutional, which is pretty big, and then he‚Äôs been a part of many lawsuits with other states‚Äô AGs filing suits to stop Trump policies that would harm people. 

So I guess what I have to say to you is that you don‚Äôt really look for a fireman when there‚Äôs no fire.
That's true, but I don't really wanna give credit to Sherrill for having a surrogate represent her because I think that's kinda silly.  She should have just shown up if she thought it was important enough that someone from her campaign had to be there
All the dems even Sweeney is better than the GOP options. Sherrill is fine, Baraka I like but Fulop is the one who actually speaks to content rather than platitudes which is why I like him best.

Like when asked about the STAY NJ bill that passed under Murphy everyone had some version of ""well we need to make NJ more affordable, blah, blah blah"" without really talking about anything in detail. Fulop when asked explained to us that the bill is literally just lip service. There is a trigger in the bill so the 50% reduction for seniors doesn't take effect unless the state budget can afford it, which at the current time requires a 12% surplus in the state budget. I'll let you guess the last time NJ had a 12% surplus in the state budget.
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThe NJ 2Ô∏è‚É£Party Duopoly business as usual! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yes...the last 2 to cancel waited till the day before...   Sweeney I can understand that he lives in South Jersey , all the other candidates within an hours drive of Westwood..
Of course they were invited. This event had been carefully planned and was even live-streamed. I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt show up. I felt bad for the organizers. They worked really hard.
They moved the day and time twice to accommodate the candidates and one by one they still said no...   What was Sweeney and Spiller's excuse for not showing?
I‚Äôd say first of all, that‚Äôs not what the caption says. They specifically mentioned that one sent a surrogate and secondly, the head of Forward United NJ said that 3 of the candidates dropped out last minute. There hasn‚Äôt been a forum like this in Bergen during the whole cycle and now they finally have one and everyone dropped out in the last few days except for Fulop and Sherril‚Äôs surrogate. 

Baraka has the same commute as Fulop, it‚Äôs in a major town in Gottheimer‚Äôs district, I didn‚Äôt hear why Sweeney dropped out, and Spiller never even got back to the organization. I wanted to hear what they all had to say, but they couldn‚Äôt be bothered. That‚Äôs pretty disappointing.
Nobody is forcing two sitting members of congress to campaign for governor. The mayor of JC managed to make it work, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs pretty busy as well.
Congress was not in session.
The Onion nailed it with their De Blasio ""Not so easy to find a mayor who doesn't suck shit"" headline.

I always look around and try to figure out median replacement mayor, from that perspective he's been pretty good. I could say the same for Baraka.
From Jersey city and he has my support. He isn‚Äôt great and I honestly don‚Äôt like him but he‚Äôs head and shoulders above every candidate running especially Sweeney and Gotheimer.
my minimum NJ Mayor favorability factor is does he or an immediate family member own a realty company in the same town with the same namesake as him lmfao
Fulop has been mayor 12 years. People get tired of a mayor after so long. I think Baraka is more popular in Newark than Fulop in JC, however. And he‚Äôs been there 10 years. I don‚Äôt k ow why we don‚Äôt term limit mayors. New Brunswick mayor has been there since Bill Clinton‚Äôs first term.
No one likes their own mayor.  But people who hear all 6 for the first time seem to be gravitating towards Fulop.  I think he‚Äôs the strongest.
I'm from JC and he's one of the best mayor's we've ever had. They're just Karen's who just want to complain.
[removed]
It sure did not lol. It's in Hoboken but never opened.
Not giving the Republican operatives reading this any ammunition by getting into it with you but I said what I said.
I didn't say all that. And again he's better than anyone or anything Republican. And the Green Party is a waste of time that nobody should support.
I wonder if our 9-1-1 system has improved, I remember reading a year or two ago that they didn‚Äôt have enough dispatchers and some calls went unanswered.   

Imagine calling during an emergency and‚Ä¶nothing.
JSQ was completely and totally neglected for decades. It is not perfect now (and nothing ever will be), but it's way better than it was.

It's even getting a park and some other public space.
He has done wonders with JC.
And this journal square area, who does it work out for? The people who lived in the area for years or a bunch of new transplants from elsewhere that have the money to enjoy all the new things u mentioned?  All the new improvements under fulop benefit those with money.

Curious what‚Äôs your rent?
I literally walk the journal square area and see it with my own eyes. Clearly I see those new high rises‚Ä¶but what does it matter if it‚Äôs unattainable for most city residents
I like Baraka most, but can‚Äôt see all the immigrants voting for him (most immigrants I know - Indian, Asian, Hispanic) are extremely bigoted against Black folks). And need to get most of the Jewish vote and a good amount of the Italian independents. Again, can‚Äôt see him locking that. Probably Fulop. Even Sherrill would have a hard time just by being female. This election we can‚Äôt mess up. I lean toward Fulop but I don‚Äôt care for him as he has a short temper and gets defensive. That said, he looks like a Jersey governor, and also he interesting legislative ideas.
You should hit the history books then.

The Greens are absolutely sensationalizing, but Americans have historically been really, really good at othering and oppressing. Sometimes they even did it to whites (see Irish, German, Italian immigration of the last ~100-150 years). Each group that gains acceptance (tolerance?) then inflicts that same pain on the next group, and the cycle continues. I'm obviously glossing over stealing blacks from Africa or killing native Indians and taking their land.

In the above example, the Germans hated the Irish, then the Irish hated the Italians. The Italians, once they were finally considered white, hated the Puerto Ricans, and now you have Hispanic voters voting against the best interests of new Hispanic immigrants. I'm further glossing over the hatred of Chinese, who built our major railroads, and the illegal imprisonment of Japanese and other Japanese-looking *American citizens* without due process, within living memory, because anyone who looked that way surely was a dirty Jap sympathizer.

We also hated the Reds (not the natives, the commies) immediately after that war, and that ended up demonizing atheists and non-Christians for generations, and is why christofacism has been on the rise for the last 40+ years. Barry Goldwater warned us, and now the Cold War Kids love Russia and hate anyone who's not a WASP.

It's hate, all the way down. Americans hate themselves and nearly everyone else, and have for a long time, you didn't need the Greens to tell you that.

Not saying we were looking for a fireman with no fire. But if you‚Äôre going to say something you should have something to back it up. And the county line thing isn‚Äôt a big deal to the everyday voter¬†
Honestly it could be a lot worse, at least they give enough of a shit to send someone to wave a flag. It depends on what the conflicting event was though.
I like Sherrill but she‚Äôs really giving Harris vibes. Surrogates, social media posts obviously by a staffer, over cheerful during these dark times. I‚Äôm fine if she‚Äôs nominee, but she needs to show up and also harness people‚Äôs anger better.
She probably had a conflict
I‚Äôll vote for any of them over the GOP nom because the right has proven themselves to be nothing more than shills for Tang the Conqueror, but if I had my choice, Fulop seems to be it.
Sweeney is as corrupt as it gets.  He's in with Trump through Norcross.
I helped to organize a few of these - the last one was in partnership with Stockton University and had to be cancelled due to a last minute scheduling conflict -- It's not just about proximity. 

To be clear I think we have many great options - I just prefer that we let the candidates speak for themselves rather than optics and inference. The organizers should have removed the empty seats and name placards.
Heard the BC Dem chair may have put pressure on candidates to stay away. Just rumors at this point but one of the organizers alluded to it.  If it‚Äôs true what does that say about the candidates? I wish I knew the truth.
All Fulop is doing is campaigning. He‚Äôs not running his city. On his Instagram he‚Äôs at campaign events all day. And it clearly shows in JC that‚Äôs there‚Äôs no leadership.
Slightly easier commute from JC to Westwood than DC to Westwood.
I like that take. You take any politician anywhere ever and people will have something bad to say about them. Nobody survives Purity tests
Being in charge of a city is about as high as you can go while still being a raging asshole who can't cooperate with anyone. It's pretty much the entire reason why the No Gods, No Mayors podcast exists.
He‚Äôs a brilliant guy.
He seems to get peeved easily.  Notice this? He got snippy with an old resident who called WNYC, who said his taxes doubled since Fulop became mayor. I‚Äôd say getting into spats with constituents is counterproductive.
Same here. We assuredly have our problems, but tbh Id rather that experience in my leader than someone who spends their days chauffeured from event to event and is always standing on pristine lawns at country clubs. He recognizes what good looks like, what bad looks like, and is proposing concrete ideas to promote what he believes good is over bad.

My question for doubters is; if you don‚Äôt think he is the guy, why, and what is someone else promising that is more aligned with you?
Not very healthy for you to refer to yourself as a rotting part of a cesspool.
A mother just posted yesterday in a local group that her baby was bit on her head in the park by an off leash dog. She called 911 and waited over an hour, they never came. What the hell are JCPD cops doing?
I remember JSQ from my high school days in the 2000‚Äôs, it was a neighborhood you would walk quickly through to get to the PATH and that‚Äôs it. Absolutely nothing but fast food and $.99 stores. Never ever in my life would I have thought I would spend 5+ years living here and watching it bloom, with zero plans to move elsewhere. And again, pre-Fulop that absolutely never would have happened¬†
I live with my partner, we each pay $1200 for a luxury one bedroom. My rent has only risen by $100 in five years due to all of the other similar apartments coming online. Our building is a converted office building, displacing zero people, but if we didn‚Äôt want to live in a new building, there are tons of far cheaper apartments in older buildings for rent in JSQ.

It really is something that otherwise nice, liberal leaning people in NJ think that campaigning against ‚Äúothers‚Äù and ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù and ‚Äútransplants‚Äù moving to their city isn‚Äôt just a sanctioned form of segregation and discrimination. You‚Äôre really just caping for the rich to get richer and for more locals to be displaced by being so reflexively anti everything ‚Äî development, housing, progress, small businesses opening left and right, new life being breathed into a dead neighborhood, you‚Äôre so concerned about JSQ how often are you hanging out at Wendy‚Äôs or Pretty Girl? Spending a lot of your time and money at C.H. Martin these days? What a hypocrite.
Curious how a mayor of JC is supposed to fix the cost of living with a 9m person city next-door that builds fuckall.

I like holding politicians responsible for things they have some control over, the cost of living in JC is just not one of them (except on the margins, and they did pass new affordable housing and zoning reforms to try and help). Building more is proven to work (see Austin and Minneapolis) but JC can't possibly build enough to soak up inventory for the metro area.
The only reason JC was attainable before was because it was a literal shithole

Completely ignoring that Musk is an unelected billionaire doing whatever he wants with the government? Fact of the matter is, even if it's true (which I doubt), I don't care if the majority of Americans love what Musk is doing, it just shows they're idiots just like you.

The only people that should be allowed to do anything to government is elected officials, and the fact that bootlickers like yourself are completely okay with your billionaire overlords doing whatever they want with your government, your money, etc shows how much of a beta cuck you people really are.

Actual peasant mindset loser you are.
And that's why it's so important. The ""everyday voter"" isn't aware of the manipulation of the ballot and how it affects how they vote.
Oh yeah, I agree it was better for her to send somebody than to not go and not send someone in her place at all!  I also agree it depends on what the conflicting event was, but given that Congress is currently not in session, I think it's disappointing she didn't go to this, especially because there is precedence of her and other candidates such as Gottheimer skipping events like these when they're held.  

I feel that if you're running for Governor, especially in a state that isn't geographically the largest such as New Jersey, you should be attending these kinda events and meeting with constituents as long as you don't have a major event conflicting.

Sherill and Gottheimer also skipped the mini-debate hosted by NJ PBS too back in November, only Fulop, Baraka, Spiller, and Sweeney were there for that one
I'm concerned by the direction Sherill is going as well.  I must admit that as I hold left leaning views, Sherrill was never the person I would have voted for in a Democratic primary, as I'd vote for someone more progressive instead.  However, I used to have respect for her, and I'm starting to be concerned by some of the things she is doing.  This is not the first event she missed, she's missed several events intended for the Democratic candidates for NJ Governor this year including a whole mini-debate hosted by NJ PBS back in November.

While I admire her being vocally anti-Trump and actually taking significant action in Congress to impeach Trump during his first term as a Representative, I also agree that her lack of coming to events to meet constituents and being overly optimistic about the current state of America is concerning and makes me worried she won't fully stand up to Trump and DOGE if she was elected.  Her voting record on human rights in Congress is also really poor, which concerns me that if she is Governor, she won't really bring positive change to New Jersey and will instead do what the status quo asks of her.

I'll of course vote for her if she is the nominee as she is definitely nowhere as bad as anyone the Republican Party would nominate, but I really think we need someone significantly more progressive, willing to stand up for New Jersey, and isn't part of any of New Jersey's political machines
I think they changed dates to accommodate the 2 house reps. But each time their answer stayed the same. Josh stayed a no and Sherrill was sending a surrogate. Honestly feels like neither wanted to be there.  I‚Äôve watched some of these forums now and Sherrill doesn‚Äôt do well next to Fulop and Baraka. I get the sense she is trying to avoid them.
God though I hope it‚Äôs not Sweeney.
I get that Sweeney is corrupt, but I'd still take him over Jack or god forbid Spadea.
The fact that there's a photo focusing on that makes me think this was a purposefully set up to interfere with the other potential candidate's agendas. I could be wrong though.
Congress isn‚Äôt in session right now
I mean, the current state of federal (and state politics all over the country) seems to make this assertion a little questionable.
You just described Fulop to a tee though.
They‚Äôre playing Candy Crush at Bob White Counter üòÇ (it‚Äôs become a running joke in the Jersey City sub)
Exactly. And that's what people don't understand. They look at JC with these nostalgic glasses as if it was better back then. I'll take the new JC over the old JC any day
‚ÄúWe each pay $1200‚Äù is a quite a way to just say you pay $2400 for a one bedroom.
Exactly. You can afford luxury apartment, which means you can focus on all the pretty things about the city, and ignoring all the bad.

Also, sounds like I touched a nerve. If your a transplant, that‚Äôs fine. All i said is the new money transplants can come in and enjoy the best JC as to offer. Am I wrong about this? It‚Äôs the plain truth. I didn‚Äôt make any other comment about them. 

Lastly, Please stop trying to paint yourself as some derided minority group‚Ä¶.my POV is shared by people who lived in the area for years. I‚Äôm not sharing anything new. Really, segregated? Segregated from what, the reality from the average jersey city resident‚Ä¶right‚Ä¶
No we‚Äôre supposed to continue to do and build nothing while hoping that negativity and exclusionary housing policy will somehow lower the rents. of course!
Native Indians and African tribal kings were not Americans, not sure of the point you're trying to make. Native Indians are now Americans, but only because the nation felt a bit of guilt and shame about it for once.

I anticipate the Greens are directing their hate toward the most contemptible people to exist and wield power since fascism was conceived. Just a guess, they could very well just hate you, you seem pretty passionate about the subject.
Damn. I had a really good response lined up for him  on his comment to me, but you burned the guy into deleting everything on this post
[removed]
His memo had nothing to do with getting that changed it was a decision by a federal court¬†
I completely agree with your points. That was a well reasoned nuanced response.
Sweeney is the only candidate with negative approval among Dems.
He couldn't even win his own seat as NJ state senate president against a nobody who spent like a thousand bucks. I've listened to Sweeney campaign and as much as I dislike him he's the only dem that is trying to actively position himself as pro-labor and supporting blue collar workers.

The NJ dems have lost touch with our states union roots and it will bite us in the ass.
I agree but the problem is he is on the same team.
This event had been planned far far in advance and I believe they had all confirmed. It‚Äôs really surprising.
Whoops! My bad.
i mean, i see him around plenty, presumably running errands, both in the heights and downtown, i saw him in newport a few days ago. he's not walking with advisors, he's running around...ive attended multiple community meetings that he has been a part of; im not sure what you want him to be doing.

i hear you, and yes i am aware that he does not use his front door lol, he drives out the garage in his house and doesnt interact with people when he's going somewhere. but at some point you (or I) might be confirming our biases.
yeah, for a luxury unit in a really nice building that is 2 blocks from a direct link to Manhattan? $2400 is a steal for our apartment¬†
That is actually pretty typical for apartments that are decent and located in areas where most people would want to live.
Instead of building new housing, what was your better plan / policy for mayors in places like JC, Hoboken, etc. surrounding NYC to keep transplants out and rents low for the broke local residents?
As I understand it, he was expected to defend it in court, but he said it‚Äôs not constitutional and refused to do so. He stood for the constitution over the nj political machine. That‚Äôs a big deal to me. 

The fireman analogy isn‚Äôt as much about Trumps fires as it is that I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs typically much attention on the state AGs normally. Now that there‚Äôs so much abuse of executive power he is taking a stand with other states so people are noticing
Thanks for the kind words, and I appreciate them.  Hope you have a good day!
Not negative enough. We can do better.
Im not running for mayor sir.

One thing someone running for mayor could actually do is banning corporations from buying single family homes in New Jersey. There‚Äôs no reason groups like Blackrock should be hoarding homes. 

I mean that‚Äôs just off the top of my head‚Ä¶
Ha! He once got peeved by my father who referred to him  as Steve. Turns out he insists on Mr Sweeney, even among peers.
It's not just the evil big bad corps like Blackrock who are charging you crazy high rent. It's local homeowners, too. There's nothing that makes being a small-time landlord who only owns 3-5 units who grew up in the area more virtuous. They are also going to charge you a huge amount of money for a run down apartment.
He‚Äôs an artifact from a time of New Jersey politics that no longer exists, for better or worse. We need a bold governor to survive the age of Trump.
You can say that again. He has big steelworkers hands that he‚Äôs proud of. Old school outdated. Doesn‚Äôt resonate with people anymore. Even the old guard isn‚Äôt interested."

To answer your question: Libertarians are not anarchists, first. Government is inherently wasteful and near always fails at management of public assets. The Libertarian solution is to remove the land from control of Parks and Forestry, and grant control to volunteer groups like the ones John Druding and Jason Howell lead. Those groups have a much better understanding of the needs of the land, as well as a much more personal connection to it.

This would minimize the amount of tax money needed, and place the public asset in much better care.
I don't care what libertarians think.
I didn't call them anarchists, those were your words.

Without government protection, private interests get involved. This minimizes the protection of land, which is a valuable asset. Handing it to private interests would, in theory, lead to restricted access, whether by rule or by fee.

This is what I'm getting at. There is no public open space in a Libertarian model, so it's disingenuous to call it accessible.

Under your model, my yard is preserved and managed by volunteer groups because my kids mow my lawn and I limit who gets to build on it by maintaining ownership.

Turtle on a fencepost bullshit.
That‚Äôs cool. Fortunately for you, Libertarians won‚Äôt be speaking on the matter. Two very invested individuals will be, though.
No need for hostility. I‚Äôm always open for discussions. Most people assume that the Libertarian model is to eliminate public land and its protection. This is an extreme position that some Libertarians hold, but doesn‚Äôt represent a realistic approach. If it was better, it would have been implemented by now.

A realistic Libertarian approach is better oversight in budgets and operations, and more involvement by private groups. In the case of a resource like this, it would be organizations like John‚Äôs and Jason‚Äôs and less expensive formal bureaucracy.

One thing that proves itself true at every turn, is that corporate capture is rampant under our current bureaucratic system. Politicians are pay-to-play and always have been. Directors and Adminstrators are always open to bribes and favors.
Don't accuse me of hostility when I am simply pushing back on falsehoods. I'm perfectly calm, so check your projection.

Your conjecture that there is bribery in the system and that it's somehow mitigated by throwing public goods to private interest is deceitfully simplistic. There are no more bribes in Libertarian models because the private interest already controls the asset, why would they need to bribe anyone to get their way after that?

I sit on a commission overseeing public assets and I have never once been approached with a bribe, nor do we operate pay-to-play. I find your statements of, 'always' being open to one as slanderous, and the concept that we're inherently wasteful to be defamatory as well. 

I think *you* may be well-intentioned in what you *think* a Libertarian model would develop into, but I would see it as a complete fantasy and the more likely outcomes once protections were handed to private parties is limited access, aka exclusivity, to areas and ultimately destruction or deprivation of those public assets.

I see Libertarians as the 'Useful Idiot' to the wealthy who want to buy up as much as possible with less interference from governments. Your double-speak is cute, but hollow. The group tries to sound enlightened, but ultimately leaves garbage out until the bears arrive.

I'm not looking to continue a debate here, I know that neither of us will convince the other, but I caution you to not fool yourself into thinking preservation has any place in Libertarianism for anyone who is not looking to hoard it to themselves behind a fence and charge people money to come see it.
So were you trying to watch the discussion or nah? Because that‚Äôs what this post is about. The NJLP is only providing the platform and the moderator, in an attempt to elevate this very important South Jersey issue.

It has nothing to do with politics. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
If it's put on by a political party, with a future Presidential candidate in attendance, it is about politics.

Again with the disingenuous statements.

I don't need to attend; it would be a waste of time. As I stated, I'm already serving on a board for public assets, I'm doing my part with our tax dollars.

JCP&L Socket Strained?,"JCP&L sent a letter that they were going to reach out to schedule a meter replacement with a new smart meter. Of course they didn‚Äôt reach out, and showed up when I was at work and my wife at the store. They left two tags hung on the front door. One says they were here to replace the meter and couldn‚Äôt due to socket strain, and to call a number. The other says they were here and replaced the meter. I looked, and the meter was replaced, and the meter box looks fine (not hanging off the siding, twisted, nor angled like JCP&L‚Äôs website references for socket strain). Finally got someone on the phone from there today, and they couldn‚Äôt be more useless. I explained I received the two tags, and asked what the issue was, since they replaced the meter, and there didn‚Äôt appear to be anything wrong / socket strain. The person I spoke with said I need to hire a licensed electrician to fix it. I asked what they were to fix. They said the socket strain. I asked if I hired someone and they came out and said there was no issue, if JCP&L was going to pay for their time. Of course we know the answer to that. I then asked if I paid for it, and there was no issue to begin with, what next. She said that would be impossible since they left the note. I then asked for the tech‚Äôs report as to what the actual issue was. The person said they don‚Äôt get a report, just the card left on the door.  I then asked if there was an issue, I paid an electrician to fix it, and they pulled a permit and had it inspected / signed off by the town, does JCP&L need to come back out and inspect it to satisfy their end. The person said ‚Äúyour electrician will know what to do‚Äù. I asked how a private electrician would know for sure what JCP&L would want. They said ‚Äúthey just will‚Äù.  Anyone been down this road, and what did you do?  ",1.0,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jfdcpc/jcpl_socket_strained/,9,1jfdcpc,2025-03-20 01:17,"My guess is they put the tag with the socket strain message by accident. They won‚Äôt place the new meter if some repair is needed.
Just a FYI, I actually took pictures of the meter before and after change to make sure no issue with electric bill - my neighbor had issues.   Good Luck.  Pay attention to your next bill.
I purchased my house in 1993 and never had a problem wth the electricity. JCP&L replaced the meter about 4 years ago. They also left a note that the incoming power cable should be replaced at my expense. I got an estimate of $4000. I chose not to do anything.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Thanks. That was my thought too. If it wasn‚Äôt physically possible, they wouldn‚Äôt, and if it was unsafe than I wouldn‚Äôt think they would.
Thanks. That‚Äôs my next fear. I was planning to, but they didn‚Äôt reach out to set up the change out like their letter said they would. I ran into the same issue at my old house. They replaced the meter, and the since the new meter started at 0, they assumed my old one rolled over completely and sent me a bill for $900 that month. Thankfully when I called they didn‚Äôt give me a headache about it. But that was PSE&G.
Thanks. Ironically I got home to a letter from them that I need to address it within 45 days, or I risk power being disconnected. It seemed like a form letter, but I don‚Äôt trust them. I‚Äôll keep the thread updated.
It is a form letter, but it means you're in their system as needing to make the repairs.
Just got this too. Thinking I call the bluff
Keep me posted please. I left a message for one electrician Monday night. Haven‚Äôt heard back yet. Will try another sometime today.

Curiously have you looked at the box on the house to see if it matches the photos on their website of examples of the issue?  Mine does not."

Yes but I get two W2s and that always confuses me for a bit at the start. If you get two W2s too, I would start by doing the fed filing, then do NJ but stop once you get up tot he part where they ask you about getting credit for another jurisdiction, then go do NY completely, then go back to NJ. That does sound confusing lol and I‚Äôm sure someone who *actually* knows what they‚Äôre doing wouldn‚Äôt do it that way but that‚Äôs what works for me."

H Mart in Edison is definitely pretty bad. While i can't say these are the worst of the state, I can definitely say it's up there. I live in Union and I can name 2 in my town.

It's like the developers just barely cleared the minimum requirement for parking spaces and lanes for the place. It's really tight.

EDIT: Oh shoot, how can I forget the worst, most poorly located Chick Fil-A located in Union on Rt 22. That's my vote. I would rather deal with the H Mart in Edison or the double parking in the Ironbound section of Newark than navigate that one on a Friday night.

This is going to sound bad, but I used to shop at Whole Foods bc the parking at the other places were always crowded. But whenever I shopped there, I kept a strict budget bc I knew things were going to be expensive.
AC airport garage!
Edison train station
There is a great 'your mom' joke here I can feel it
Any ShopRite
Just park behind Le Peep. There‚Äôs a whole side with parking behind H MART too. You can even park in that neighborhood adjacent to LE PEEP
Any Costco
Wawa in fairfield
Costco in Union. Fuck that
Jersey Gardens during weekends/holidays
Anywhere in Flemington...EVERY.  SINGLE.  ONE.
costco in edison
COSTCO IN WHARTON
Wawa on route 35/Lakewood Road in Wall Township.
Any ShopRite parking lot, but particularly the one in Neptune
Bayonne Costco seems fine until you‚Äôre there when it‚Äôs busy
ShopRite in Piscataway
MetLife Stadium is pretty atrocious, any event takes forever to get out of. Hackensack University Medical Center parking garage could be in the running too, nine floors without a single parking spot and sometimes you just drive up and down for forty five minutes or longer looking for anything, then when it's time to leave you wait in line for one of the two cashiers at the exit. Or maybe Palisades Medical Center in North Bergen, a similar situation of driving around and hoping for a spot to open up but if high tide comes in and you park in the wrong spot, your socks are getting wet.
>My vote has to be the H Mart parking lot in Edison.

I mean, I wouldn't call it ""the worst"" in all aspects, it's just overcrowded, but same thing applies to many other places in Edison right now. For example the Costco in Edison - I started to completely avoid it at all costs after being unable to find a single parking space a couple of times, and it wasn't even a weekend on those days, so I just use other Costcos where finding parking spots is never an issue.
Shoprite in Toms River on Fisher Boulevard.

Literally car on top of car. 

Manchester is a close second. People drive into the building.
ShopRite in Garwood. Terrifying.
Trader joe‚Äôs in clifton or Costco in clifton.
Omg yes that hmart plaza on the weekend is scary. I stole someone‚Äôs spot one time and I still feel bad about it, like that spot was clearly his and I swooped in üò≠üò≠ I got my karma don‚Äôt worry
Starbucks in Deptford. It's right at a huge intersection, and the drive through line piles up out of the lot onto the main road *in both directions*. Cars in the turning lane need to cross heavy traffic to get in *and* be let in by someone lined up on the shoulder. Half of the parking spots are blocked by the drive through line, and cars often drive in to the one-way exit to try to get around it. The exit is also right-turn-only, but that doesn't stop people from trying to turn left across 4 lanes of traffic.
Teterboro Costco/Walmart parking lot

Edit: Just checked and see it named at least 10+ other times so I know it‚Äôs not me lol
Hmart in Edison on a Saturday
ShopRite in Garwood, ShopRite in Clark less so

TJ's in Westfield too
Any Costco parking lot
Costco/Walmart Teterboro
100% agree with H Mart. They just keep adding more businesses so the already busy parking lot keeps shrinking.
Hmart Edison for sure takes the win, I‚Äôve seen several people total their cars on that intersection.

Including me ü•¥
All of them
All Kean University lots
I'm surprised at how few of these I'm familiar with. 
I have a particular beef with the Target parking lot in Vauxhall on Springfield Ave. There's plenty of parking in it, but a big section is on the other side of a traffic lane, and they didn't lay out any safe way to cross to it. No crosswalk or area resembling one.  I don't have to drag little kids with me anymore, but I would avoid that side if I did.  
I'm on the Zoning Board of nearby Maplewood, so I know this stuff.  Whoever approved this lot f***ed up.
But I wouldn't call it one of the worst in NJ. That's a pretty high bar.
First Place - Route 24 exit onto 287 North.  Generally opposed to naming things after people ( see Stockton , Richard - American traitor)  but every exit in 287 deserves te name if the offending highway engineer and township mayor who collaborated on the worst designed modern highway, post 1975, in the US.  This is the worst of the worst.
Second Place - New Providence shopping center.  Never a dull minute with Braunschweiger‚Äôs at the center.
Parking structure across the street from HMH Riverview medical center in Red Bank. It's basically employee parking but it's not labeled as such. There is pay for parking but it's cash only with the exact amount. I didn't see a sign for this anywhere until I left. I was stuck inside the parking structure until a nice employee used her employee badge to get me out.
Aldi in Willingboro
+1 for mitsuwa edgewater and +1 for clifton TJ (made worse by the people who don‚Äôt know one side is a one way smh‚Ä¶ tbf the sign is not very clear)
Target, trader joes and Costco lot in Bridgwater. I do not go to these stores on Sunday anymore lol. Absolute madness
Adding my votes for Costco in Wharton and any Trader Joe's (just...why??).
I-78 near the Newark bay bridge during rush hour
Have almost gotten into multiple fights in the Costco lot in Union
costco
Any Trader Joe‚Äôs
Trader Joe 17N Paramus is ass too.
Oh honey‚Ä¶ try the Clifton one on Route 3
The one in North Brunswick is shockingly normal. Westfield takes the cake tho as they have 10 parking spots for the whole store.
the one in Brick is horrible too
It‚Äôs like their business model is to buy overly small stores with ridiculously small lots. The stores in Marlton and Princeton have exactly the same lot situation.

I refuse to shop there anymore because it‚Äôs so ridiculous.
Cherry hill parking lot tjs isn't bad. If 70 construction wasn't so horrible it would be worth it to drive.
The one in Marlton is nowhere near as bad as the Trader Joe‚Äôs in Westfield especially on a weekend. That one is truly a Hunger Games situation.
the one in Brick sucks
This.
I nominate Westfield TJs...
The one in Westwood NJ is no piece of cake. I recently found out commenters that take the train to NYC park there. They do nothing about it apparentlyü§£ü§£
Literally every Trader Joe‚Äôs parking lot in the state
The Westfield location is spicy, and the Bridgewater location is bad because the entire Bridgewater Promenade is a total mess (Home Depot, Target, Old Navy, Trader Joe's AND Costco).
Every time I get the urge to make the trek up there again, I think of the parking and reconsider.
Been going since the 1980‚Äôs (it was called Yaohan plaza then).  I won‚Äôt go there unless it‚Äôs opening time for the place.  And during the summer festival, parking and even leaving is like a video game (but no extra lives).
I haven‚Äôt been to mitsuwa in 10 years. Mostly because of the parking.
I've been in Mitsuwa.  I don't remember it as that bad, but I haven't been there for a decade.
It is probably my 2nd in my craplist.
This was the first lot I thought of¬†
The last time I was there was three years ago, maybe. It wasn‚Äôt great, but still possible. Not sure about today.

H Mart Edison wasn‚Äôt great, but I never had a problem as long as I didn‚Äôt mind walking a little.
It‚Äôs not too bad if you get there before 11.
Sometimes me and my family go there really early to snag some parking. Worst case scenario is to park at a different parking lot but near Mitsuwa and walk there.
I've been to both, and after HMart plaza added a building with more restaurants with little extra parking, it's been consistently worse than Mitsuwa. And the plaza is adding another new building... They badly need a parking garage.
Forgot all about the parking at the Route 27 Asian Shopping Center! Getting out at the exits can be terrible as well.
Yup
The one in Fort Lee is bad too
That parking lot DESPERATELY needs a traffic light.
It wasn‚Äôt always like this. 5 years ago it was still good. Idk why they crammed that building in the middle of the lot. Twas a simpler time but alas.
Yeah that one is brutal. We were meeting family for dinner at Mesob. I suggested my uncle try that deck forgetting he had a big SUV. He didn't even try fully making the turn to go up. Saw the paint streaks and reversed back out lol
Pretty sure I left some paint scratches on that wall when I first started driving. Those ramps gave me panics attacks. Now I can‚Äôt ever go in there without thinking about that brutal rape scene from the Sopranos.
South Plainfield, Somerville, Watchung and Bound Brook ones scare me especially haha.
I just park in the way back away from other cars, I would rather do the extra walking.
For real. I always thought the ShopRite in Manahawkin had a bad parking lot. But I figured that it was an anomaly and perhaps it would be better in a different town. 

How wrong I was. I visited the ShopRite in Sayerville and somehow their parking lot is a disaster too. Now I‚Äôm just convinced that ShopRite intentionally designs their parking lots to be as terrible, dangerous, and anxiety inducing as possible.
Passaic is not bad (I mean the one on Paulison; the defunct 8th Street store was pretty bad when it was open).

There used to be one on Union Ave in Rutherford that the lot was way too small, but I never went there any way. Nutley has three lots (one on each side of the store and one across the street) and none of them are big enough for a store that size.
The one that I shop the most at is actually pretty good. Large spots, many available, 3 entrances and exits. Just try to avoid the main. This is the Elizabeth one.
My local 2 ShopRites are fine
The new ShopRite in old bridge ain‚Äôt bad.
The Shoprite in Greenwich Township, Warren County is god awful. I avoid going there at all costs.
The one in Roxbury is my personal hell.
I used to work overnights at the Willow Rite Aid, back when it was 24 hours.

Every night a tow truck operator would come in at about 11:30 PM and announce ‚ÄúIf you have the car with plate number such-and-such please come to the front.‚Äù If nobody showed up in a few minutes, he‚Äôd hook the car and leave. If it was an employee car or one of the few customers we got at that time, he‚Äôd repeat with another car.

The next act would take place at 3:05 on the dot. Someone who was at the pool hall across the street, which closed at 3, would come storming into the store demanding to know where his car was at. ‚ÄúRead the sign, Bub.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut I was shopping here!‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bought a stick of gum and a pack of cigarettes four hours ago, that doesn‚Äôt give you rights to the lot all night.‚Äù
Can‚Äôt even park lmao
all of brick
Echoing this. Pure chaos. Just trying to get into the parking lot is a nightmare.
Ugh that one is terrible. So is the Manahawkin one.
So real, i wont even go there anymore
Getting in-and-out of the Chick Fil A over there was always quite an experience haha
Route 22 is almost like a highway and that's the problem.  Too many merges from the left lane which is usually more unsafe.
Stroads are just awful
Omg yes. I only went there once. I'm glad I moved away.

Thinking about that spot makes me miss The Red Chimney. Remember that place? So good.
I stopped going to Point Pleasant - 95% of the reason was the parking
""Any Ironbound Newark Portugese Restaurant""

This.
Nah cherry hill Costco is alright. New Brunswick was a bit nerve wracking lol
As a former student of both RVCC & Kean, yes! I think RVCC is worse than Kean though.
Ground level or the basement level?
Yup
Agree re MetLife Stadium or that godforsaken American Nightmare mall adjacent to it. It's like navigating a gigantic strand of spaghetti getting out of there - a relief to be back on the Turnpike.
I don‚Äôt bother with it anymore. I just park on the street and pay the meter
Even the municipal lot next to it is a nightmare to get a spot in during busy times
That shop rite itself was a mess. They didn‚Äôt shift the store until after I graduated from Rutgers and left the area, but when I discovered they did that I was like thank god
Still terrible over at Hadley sadly (I always end up parking in the back near Burlington or Chick Fil A to best avoid stress).

I think they're putting a Patel Brothers where Shoprite was and that will def fill the lot again.
Just park by the Macys men‚Äôs department. The entrance where they sell shoes and cologne. It‚Äôs so depressing no one ever parks there
Can confirm Bridgewater sucks
Trader Joe‚Äôs in Freehold is actually pretty good. The parking lot is huge.
Why is this!?! Such a great store with a terrible parking lot. My local one has a shit parking lot. Same with our Shop Rite.
Yes! The Wayne one is the best out of all the TJ‚Äôs. I was shocked every time I went and didn‚Äôt have an issue.
I live in Clifton but drive to the Wayne TJs to avoid that shitshow on Rt.3
Or Denville, or Florham Park.
Worked over there for years. Only chill parking area was near what used to be Babies R Us (now Bob's Furniture). Madhouse like you said otherwise (especially during minor league games).
Trying to get out of target can be horrible, but the area between TJ‚Äôs and Costco is the worst.
Came here to specifically mention this one, and I am so happy others agree!
For me, my favorite part of that shopping center are hedges that line the entrances/exits that prevent you see the traffic coming around the curve on Promenade Blvd, that never needed to be curved in the first place.
>To a degree, The AMC in New Brunswick, specifically the exit, is bad.

I refuse to go there unless someone else drives lol.
It's impossible to make a left turn to Nassau Park Blvd on a weekend.
The Walmart one is terrible too
By far worst Costco Parking lot üòÇ
Just driving in Lakewood sucks.
I always purposely park on the sides haha easiest way to get out imo
Came here to say this. Only lot that gives me anxiety.
This is the answer, everyone is so polite holding the door for you, then tries vehicular manslaughter in the parking lot.

There a meme somewhere about this.
They finally opened a trader joes in Cherry hill  a few years ago in enough of a mall area theres lots of parking. Its crazy.
Then there‚Äôs the whole weird Shop Rite-Hobby Lobby-Zenleaf complex on the Neptune/Ocean border that is like being in a demolition derby.
The Target lot is pretty bad too
üíØ
There's a Gourmet Glatt or two in Lakewood who would like a word
I love Reddit lol
Probably the strangest ShopRite in Northern NJ
And all the restaurants have pretty good local reputations too haha which makes having to park there even harder.
Ever since Sam‚Äôs Club and Walmart closed that side has been fine. The rest is still chaotic on weekends
![gif](giphy|1msK2aCNYvHiCUmaGz)
üíØ
Trader Joe‚Äôs in Westfield!
Better than Clifton. At least you can sometimes park in the back near Sette Drive.

I pick up flowers there every Friday for the table, and I‚Äôve pretty much given up on Clifton TJ‚Äôs on Fridays.
Never going back, that place left my traumatized.¬†
Was going to write this. So bad it is criminal.
Speaking of Paramus, the amazon fresh parking lot with the dealership storage is an eyesore
Trader Joe‚Äôs Rt 17N Paramus, That‚Äôs closed now
Came to say route 3 Clifton Trader Joe‚Äôs üòÖ quite the nightmare lot!
The parking lot for the plaza with the Chipotle, Panera, and Michael's might be even worse. The curbs at the four way stop sign as you enter are built too far out, and people are constantly driving over them if they take a right with a car at the stop sign to their right because the turn needs to be made so sharply.
Say nomore!
The worst
Have you been to the Costco in Wayne? That actually might be worse than TJs
THE worst.
Friend of mine used to work there. He has to transfer because of how crazy the entire thing is. Parking. Customers. Everything.
I immediately stopped complaining about the Clifton Trader Joe‚Äôs when I went to the Westfield store.
THIS exactly! Westfield is like the Hunger Games of parking lots
When I shopped at that one, I would literally park around the front of the building by the suit shop and walk over to TJ rather than risk my life in that lot.
Oh, they're all horrible, make no mistake... and I feel like that's by design. But I mentioned the Marlton one in particular because most of the parking in the lot is designated for the other businesses who have signs threatening to tow your car if you park there for Trader Joe's. So the only real TJ spots are along a corner when you first get in from Rt 73. There are people constantly coming and going and since it's along the corner, it gets things backed up and if you go past the corner, you have to turn around at the end of the lot, which is tricky. It's nightmare fuel.
The Bridgewater one is bad? I go to it all the time and never had an issue. In fact, it's somewhat convenient as I just park between TJ and Costco and get both shopping done at the same time.
When they have the festivals it's impossible to get a spot if you're not there early. When it's a nice day I just park at Target and walk along the water to get there. It's really not that bad of a walk unless you plan on doing serious groceries.
Ive seen the videos from japan of the people they employ to shove people into the train cars for maximum occupancy, does mitsuwa need to employ bulldozers to shove more cars into the parking lot?
Oh God I hate that parking lot!!!
Neptune and Belmar are also terrible.
What is wrong or scary about the Somerville parking lot?
My first date with my husband was at that pool hall. I had totally forgotten about it hahaha
When I was growing up there, there were always available spots on the block right behind Rite Aid--it was my secret parking hack. Not so much anymore.
When i lived there a while ago, double parking was for chumps, triple parking was the expert move. Especially on Washington.
Ha! I mentioned some parking lots in Union in my comment but shit, how can i forget this one. Absolute nightmare and I bet the Chick Fil-A corporation regrets putting a location there. There are times I try to go there and just give up and drive 15 minutes further to the one in Scotch Plains.
That Chick Fil A is fucked up
Lol it's terrible!
Lol the struggle is real
Lol
Haha weighing both in my head right now, I'd say RV also.
I see what you did there.
Considering I can never get out when I need to‚Ä¶ obviously the ground level
Yes I heard that Patel Brothers is coming directly from the owner of the ramen place there. Should be interesting.
Ha I‚Äôve never been to that one, just north jersey ones!
Yea, I like driving to that store - easy to get in/out of the parking lot, ALWAYS plenty of parking spaces at any day of the week, does not feel overcrowded inside.
Sorry..it sucks. People can't park. I came out to my car and an asshole parked so close I couldn't get into it.
Wegmans traffic meets Target traffic meets parking lot designed by the devil himself.
It's just a constant shitshow. I've probably ended up parking in front of 16 Handles more than in the Costco area.
This gave me a good laugh
This is such an accurate description üòÜ
Oh yeah, that one too. That whole area has very tricky parking aotuations
There's no way that's not your own alt account. Two different accounts at the same time posted the exact same comment down to the punctuation
Yes exactly lol! It's rightfully packed
Omg with all the Cyberstucks in there!!!!! It's uggo.
It was open 2 days ago. Maybe you are confused?
404 NJ-17, Paramus, NJ 07652
I would personally like to fist fight whoever came up with that intersection design.
Agree. Worse by a mile
TJ in Princeton is a pretty normal parking lot.  Westfield is a bit borderline.  And those are the two that can sell beer.
it literally is by design. they pick locations with smaller parking lots so they look more full/busy.
It‚Äôs that whole layout that I can‚Äôt stand. Too many unnecessary curves that create blind spots when you‚Äôre pulling out, hedges that block your view of oncoming traffic, people too hesitant to make left turns out of or into the lots because they‚Äôre too scared to pull out. You sound like me; I don‚Äôt mind parking a little farther out if it‚Äôs more walking but more convenient.
Opposite. ¬†Weekdays are a minor inconvenience because of people not paying attention when driving. ¬†Weekends it‚Äôs near impossible to park, to a point where people create parking spots because all the spots are taken, and the lot becomes downright dangerous due to people not paying attention, I‚Äôm assuming drivers more focused on looking for parking spots instead of on the road¬†
Lol üíØ
Haha when I'm in that area to visit a relative (Neptune) I always end up parking near the Carvel. The Belmar (or is it Wall haha) one has a shitty design for sure.
Easy peasy compared to the Long Branch one.
Getting out of there sucks with both exits due to other cars always also approaching.
When I worked there, there was a guy with a blue and white Rambler Metropolitan that used to park on that block. It amazed me that a normal sized human could fit in that thing.
Haha when I went to Kean this was my go-to place for breakfast, lunch or dinner depending on class times. The store operator (who has since passed away) was a super-nice guy so you could say I became loyal to the location at the time. But damn, getting out of there was something else unless it was like 6 am haha.
üíØ
North Plainfield Costco is okay as well. Compared to the devil that is Union Costco.
Also that Indian vegetarian buffet next door is fire. Now that I think about it I need to go back hehe.
South Brunswick Target is better anyway lol.
No. I accidentally posted this comment on my alt account (not this account you are responding to). I then posted on my normal and deleted the alt comment.  But before I deleted I guess people saw it was posted twice and copied and pasted as a joke.Unless there is a glitch duping comments, since it seemed to have trouble deleting.
Guy thought nobody would notice üòÇüòÇ
I just looked at the street view; that place is a mess.
idk how that shopping center ever got approved, it‚Äôs design is diabolical¬†
Belmar/Wall border, yeah, such a weird location and setup.
Aww RIP to that guy. It‚Äôs always nice when a business remembers their frequent customers. 

But yeah, I tell my wife, if we don‚Äôt get there before the dinner rush, we‚Äôre not going. I always feared for the safety of those cars waiting on the side of Rt 22 just waiting to enter the lot. Scary.
What? No. I did accidentally post my comment on an alt account. Then I realized it was the alt and posted on my normal and deleted the alt comment. But this account isn‚Äôt the alt and that comment was deleted. I just assume people saw the brief moment I accidentally posted twice before deleting and copies and paste as a joke.

Just felt the need to defend myself since I‚Äôm not that much of a loser to comment on my own sock account lol
Oh my gosh that definitely was a nail biter looking at those lines!
is that why i saw that comment from 6 different accounts lol i thought i was missing an inside joke somewhere
I have seen accidents there too. One of the busier U turn lanes is next to it (eastbound side) and drivers are always aggressively trying to enter it so that just adds to the congestion and chaos
Yes. I don‚Äôt know how people saw I commented twice. It was up for less than a minute lol.

"Experiences with Perry Nickelston, DO/chiro in Saddle River?","Someone recommended the DO and chiropractor Perry Nickelston in Saddle River to me because they took his Eye Mojo course and I am having neurological problems with my eyes.

Paint and sip classes

Arcades

Small venue concerts (Asbury Park)

Check the events lists at coffee shops (Fine Grind in Little Falls, for example, hosts a trivia night, coloring night, board game night, open mic night, live music night) 

Brewery - a lot of them have games like cornhole, horseshoes, giant Connect 4

Find a trivia night. Years ago I went to one in Hoboken, I‚Äôm sure tons of bars all over the state have them 

Ice skating 

Turtleback Zoo

I think there‚Äôs an ice rink that does curling classes? 

Volunteer for a charity

Birdwatching

Find a hiking group, geocaching, etc

Comedy Club

Drag shows

Pick a shore town and go for a walk. Bring a kite or a ball. 

I would find a local college or a town with a big hipster population (Hoboken, Jersey City, Montclair, Asbury Park, maybe Morristown) and look for events listings on Instagram and posted in bars and coffee shops
Why doesn't anyone specify where they live? ""Central NJ"" doesn't help narrow down suggestions. Are you in Phillipsburg? Toms River? Princeton? Carteret? Frenchtown? Long Branch? Bridgewater?
Ever head to Six Flags Great Adventure?
  If you enjoy painting there are usually local paint and sip shops you can take a class together, If you enjoy walks Duke farms has some nice small trails, If you like fishing you could go out on one of the charter boats for a 1/2 day of fishing (south NJ Point Pleasant), NJ botanical gardens (northern part of state, but worth the drive), there will be a bunch of different local fairs starting soon with the warm weather (might still be a couple months out though), there are usually local farms within driving distance you can pick your own vegetables/fruit and then after you can cook together. A bunch of random ideas, not sure if any would fit you both but either way have fun!
The botanical gardens in ringwood are pretty when everything starts getting greener and the weather warms up a little. Also, the vault arcade in Morristown is fun. Finally there‚Äôs a fun bar with video, table and board games in  parsippany called recess.
The Korean spa in Edison, you can always get a Groupon for it! 

I also like browsing grocery stores in ethnic neighborhoods, there are always new things to try and it‚Äôs a conversation starter when my spouse & I learn that one of us has had something that the other hasn‚Äôt heard of. Often leads to cheap-ish impulse buys and a fun night of cooking something new.
Silverball Museum in Asbury Park.
Very expensive for date night. It'll cost about $100 per person for tickets/food.

Keep in mind I would suspect u will have school loans to pay back . Pay em while u can . Kudos to you chief . Wish all 23 year olds had your drive and ambition. Good luck
That‚Äôs not bad at all
It all depends .. do you share rent with someone ? Being single . If you live within your means and control your expenses .. you should be okay . Just keep growing .. get the highest degree you can .. when I graduated with my bachelors in nursing , I was making about $2,300 biweekly, I was starting a family, I was living comfortably but my rent was very low, I went back to school and got my master's degree which made a huge difference in income.. I'm now making close to 160k yearly .. and live very comfortably while keeping my expenses under control .. 

The idea here is that you are still young and have so much room and time for growth so take advantage of that while keeping your expenses to a minimum, keep getting education and degrees for growth, if you are planning to have a family one day, your expenses will double so you will need better income...
Gross or net?
Currently live on that in north jersey. It‚Äôs tight but doable
That‚Äôs incredible! I definitely wasn‚Äôt independent or making that much at 23! You‚Äôre definitely going places
At 23 I was making like half that a week at target, you‚Äôre doing good buddy. If you thought you felt behind in life trust me people like me have felt like that since we were 18, I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out (at 26) and even though you‚Äôre doing good there‚Äôs nothing stopping from doing even better. Good luck bro!
It‚Äôs pretty good for your age. But don‚Äôt settle keep on climbing as much as you can because shit will akways get more expensive abd im sure you want to make enough to enjoy
Is that take home or pre-tax? If it is take home, it isn't awful, especially if it is just while you're in school.
I made $0 back then. You are doing very well.
Do you keep a budget? A basic one to follow is the 50/30/20. That helps to keep you living within your means while saving and adding to retirement. Get a Roth IRA if you haven‚Äôt already!
You are in school and working and young. You're doing great. Keep your eye on the prize and plans after the degree.
Of course it‚Äôs good! Stay in the safe zone of debt and you‚Äôll be great!
At 23, I was waiting to get $225 in cash in an envelope under the table every Friday. Unfortunately that was a lot more money in 2013 than it is now and I was surprisingly able to split an apartment paying $400 a month. Still was dirt poor for the time tho.
I didn‚Äôt start making over 32k until I was 30 years old. It was 2015 and I was making 50k. 
(I somehow skipped the 40k range)

You are ahead of most people your age and older.
This is around what I make and I do ok, but I live with roommates. This is very normal for early twenties, you‚Äôre doing fine. I‚Äôm in my late twenties and don‚Äôt make much more, and in fact have many close friends my age that make as much as you or less. 

As hard as it may be try to set a little something aside each month for emergencies, that tends to be the stuff that really sets me back some months. And if your job offers 401k make sure you contribute what you can. Retirement is a long way off but it‚Äôs best to start young for the best outcome.

You‚Äôre doing well! Try not to be discouraged by comparing yourself to peers especially if you only see them on social media. People only present the best, idealized versions of themselves on there which makes them look like they‚Äôre so ahead in life. The reality is most of the trips and luxury goods people show off are only possible because of either massive credit card debt or generational wealth. Frivolous debt isn‚Äôt really something to aspire to and you can‚Äôt go back in time to change who you were born to so there is no point dwelling on either of these things. 

Focus on yourself! Comparison is the thief of joy!
Don't judge your situation while you are getting your degree. You are doing the best you can right now.
It's okay net. Not that much if gross, but if your paying your bills what does it matter.
How much do you keep after all the expenses?
Working and going to school full time?!  You are amazing!!
You are blessed in life invest your time wisely and take it slow life isn‚Äôt a rush it all takes time to build a strong foundation up and down only break you if you let them.
If your bills are paid, you're not starving, and an emergency doesnt break you, you're fine. 

Generally speaking? $800 a week is roughly 42K a year. If this is after taxes and health insurance its good depending on where you live. 

For example expensive states like California, New York, NJ, etc...42K is not enough. States like Pennsylvania, Texas, the Carolinas you could be comfortable. 

If this is before taxes and you are uninsured, than its bad. Essentially anywhere.
More than I make so you‚Äôre doing pretty well in my eyes
Talk home?
How much is your car insurance? Curious
Pretty decent. I'm also a full time college student, and I work part time. I make \~$200-300 weekly, depending on how many hours I get.

Decent, make sure you are paying into your 401k/whatever retirement account, it adds up over the years, even if the market isn't doing well at the moment. Will reduce your take-home though, so up your retirement contribution before you are used to all the extra cash."

Tires are not good for your children to play round regularly..

But if you want a tire regardless, I would call some local farm stands I am sure a farmer will have an old tire to sell.. good luck!
Giant tires are heavy and difficult to load onto a pick up truck or roof of a car
Go to a tires shop in your town and ask if they have a trash tractor tire out back because they‚Äôre going to have to pay to get rid of. I got mine for free and they even helped load it on the trailer.

Was surprised to see them there myself. Never were there when I was younger, saw the formerly endangered osprey a few times but never seals. I guess NYC stopping dumping their garbage 6 miles offshore in the early 90's was good for the environment after all. Too bad the EPA is getting gutted now.

I guess they closed West bound lanes as a precaution. Traffic is going to be a nightmare. Wharton and Jefferson residents can't catch a break. Especially since RT15 South was closed for awhile not too long ago.
Sinkhole de mayo coming early
There‚Äôs also an accident on 80 in that area right now
They need to bridge both sides ASAP like they did up the road on route 15. 

This is all going to get worse before it gets better.  I already had to change my work hours to help with the traffic‚Ä¶.at this point I will go in even earlier.
My dad worked on building parts of route 80 in the 60s. I'll tell him he fucked it up.

Also makes me nervous that there‚Äôs a sinkhole waiting to happen under one of the apartment buildings in my complex. The Avalon is already seeing suspicious signs.
Small businesses and rockaway mall must be suffering so much and only going to get worse
Got caught in the traffic in the way home. Was an nightmare by Denville.
ok so i‚Äôm guessing the highway really was just built over a few abandoned, complex mines and engineers at the time were just like ‚Äúthis‚Äôll work‚Äù

edit: idk i‚Äôm not an engineer how does this happen? do you, like, not survey? lol
I don't believe in curses. Then I look at 80 and reconsider.
I think y‚Äôall better just consider moving lol
so if I travel 80W to get to Jefferson (BVR) will I be affected by this? Can you take 80 up to exit 34/rt 15?

I take 287 to 80 to 15 every Friday. As an alternate I could take 287 to 23 instead but I'm not sure it's worth the less direct route if I can still get off and on 80 at rt 15.
You would think we could, I dunno, expand service at mt Arlington station, until we get this fixed
I‚Äôm so glad I don‚Äôt live near that mess. Holy cow!

I don't get it. Why are they so stupid? When the first sinkhole in December happened, they should've started actually working up a big project to fix the issue instead of slapping a bandaid on it. I thought 80 would be closed indefinitely while they actually worked on the issue when the first sinkhole happened. When they ""fiixed"" the damn thing in three days I was like, no way is that it. To me it seems like a multibillion decade long project to actually find all the mines and fill them properly and rebuild.
Just sat in traffic on rt 10 westbound for an extra 40 minutes.
Wait holy moly it‚Äôs on the west exit now? I have to travel to work once a week to a facility up in Newton. UGH. I‚Äôve been having trouble going from Newton back to Montclair where I live cause of the closure on the eastbound side but now both ways are closed? This is crazy. I heard it will take around 2 months to fix the eastbound one, does anyone know if that is the same case for the other side?
Great. Great

Yup. Word is that these are called Voids. There was a preliminary investigations going back 20+ years. 


This might be the tip of the iceberg for 80.

Curious why adding more NJT service is simply not a consideration. Even if you take 30 people off the road, thats better than nothing!
Moved west from Wharton about a year ago. Commute 30 miles East. Initially, my commute went from 30 minutes to 40, not the end of the world. 

With Eastbound closed, my commute jumped to an hour, sometimes a little more. This is going to destroy me.
WELL‚Ä¶ I do not look forward to driving home from work today. I might consider doing an early shift if it can help me go home to less traffic but even then, I‚Äôm not sure how much it‚Äôll help
I feel so bad for the folks who need to go that way :(
I have to visit my parents in Pa. this is such a headache, I think if I get off 80 around exit 28 I can skip over to 46 or 15 to get around this earlier than where the detours are
My wife's bus took an extra 45 min getting home yesterday. And her bus only goes to the park and ride at Rockaway Mall before the closure.

Our school in Rockaway had a delayed opening this morning due to the issues this is causing with school buses and teachers/staff making it into school.
How many sinkholes does this make? I feel like I keep hearing about them on 80. Is this a new one or a continuation from others before?
Guess that means they didn't do nearly as good a job as they said, testing for more voids last month.

I‚Äôll be semi glad if the crossover solution has to be abandoned. One that is going to make west bound a disaster during evening rush. Two I was worried that the crossover would allow authorities to think taking months to fix east bound is acceptable.

5 more sinkholes.
There was a really bad wreck on Monday night, someone was flown out by helicopter. Multi car wreck involving a tractor trailer. 


This highway is a mess.
Feels like a Kaiju is getting ready to come up under Rt 80.
does he have any insight as to why they just built over the top of the portal to hell?  obviously they just didn't want to spend a mountain of money but i would really love to hear what the prevailing reasoning was.  ""the law doesn't say we have to so we're not gonna"" is generally everybody's thought process until enough people die / it costs more to avoid it.  but still, this was inevitable.
I have a drone.
The Squeegee Men have nothing on the Taylor Ham men!

Yes. It appears that a new sink hole has opened up on the westbound side just as they were trying to open up the 2 way bypass. In other words, it's worse.

My office building is by the Walmart. So I occasionally grab lunch at the mall. Last week when I went the food court was pretty busy. Usually will walk around after eating didn‚Äôt seem any less busy than normal. But it‚Äôs still a ghost town compared to years ago.
I just spent over an hour shopping around Rockaway Mall rather than sit in the stopped dead traffic. So at least for today I think they did okay...

But in general, yeah I'm avoiding that area like the plague until this gets fixed...
I left Denville to head west around 4:45, I must‚Äôve missed the closure by like 20-25 minutes üò¨
I think the earthquake last year may have fucked all the mines
they knew they were there.  why they didn't excavate when the highway was built ($$$) is beyond me...my guess is eminent domain purchases further east were eating up a ton of money, so they figured ""eh, we'll be dead by the time that becomes an issue"" and just built the highway over it all.  could be there was an assumption/ loose plan to reconcile it at a future date, but it never got done...who knows.  

shit like this is why we have the regulations we do now.  i had a bad feeling that they were going to band-aid it for the time being when they announced ""two months"" and subterranean monitoring systems, but hoped that was a buy-time-while-we-figure-out-an-actual-fix tactic (i was expecting at least a year to legitimately shore up the whole substructure).  looks like the roadway is trying to force their hand.
Idk if this is true, but I heard they packed the mine shaft full of old cars and by now they have probably deteriorated. Interesting if true? I have no idea.
I mean, it‚Äôs built almost directly over a town literally called Mine Hill, isn‚Äôt it?
They only moved the headstones!
Everyone from the city moved here welcome back to the city.
Can still get off on 15 from 80w, but that is where all 80 west bound traffic is going to funnel, so have fun with that.
I believe that‚Äôs not really possible because the electrified line ends at Dover.
Closures due to sinkholes aren't that uncommon, every so often on twitter or 511 you'll see that they close a lane or road cause of a sinkhole. And I don't think they a) knew the severity and b) didn't want the public outrage of closing both ways when the sinkhole was originally on the shoulder.
Can take Exit 34 which is route 15N. ¬†Take that into Sparta, make a left at the light, and you‚Äôre on Newton Sparta road. ¬†That takes you directly into the center of Newton.

Heading from Newton you can take Newton Sparta road to 15 then to 80 or all the way up to Rt. 23. ¬†Can take 23 all the way to Bloomfield Ave in Verona.

Long way of saying yeah, this is less than ideal
The most feasible place to increase rail service from would be Dover because that's the end of the electrified line. But unfortunately thats before/after the closed section.

Increased bus service would be more realistic, but really you would want to increase service to NYPA and NJ transit doesn't run that service, it's Lakeland.

I suppose NJ Transit could work with Lakeland to increase service but again you have the issue of where are they picking commuters up from. And unfortunately the biggest stop is Rockaway Mall which again is before/after the closure.

I totally agree transit needs to be looked at as part of the solution. But it really is not an easy short term solution. If anything this event should show that mass transit needs to be focused on more in this area long term so the next time something like this happens its less of a disaster.

Where in PA? ¬†A few different routes you can take
My wife is a teacher at KDM. ¬†Crazy stuff
It‚Äôs a new sinkhole, but they‚Äôre all due to what I assume to be the same mine. ¬†All sinkholes have been in the same area.

im a bit more north in West Milford and my commute to work was almost 2 hours today. I cant keep doing this every day
Said a lot of it was built over swampy land so they just filled as best they could and kept going. Reminds me of florida which is known for sinkholes due to poor land underneath.
I do not believe they knew there was a mine that went under there. If it's an old enough mine the entrance likely collapsed and no one has seen it, who knows possibly for 150 years. It was only while inspecting the original hole that it became obvious it was a mine. It's also not like the mine was 10 feet below the surface. It was down much further than they needed for any work building it.
Can you hit me with it, directly in my skull?
So do I, but I'm a little more than the 1/2 lb limit that it has. That being said, on it's own it could make it to my office on one battery.
""Another sinkholllle we the bessssttt!""
Even if it takes 4 months to repair (hopefully not) considering a 60 year old highway, this section has had a 99.44% operational uptime between shut downs from sinkholes.   History seems to show they made the right call 60 years ago to not spend money on something that may never have been a problem.
sounds like a jersey story. who knows? lmao
Dude. I thought that same thought. Are we sure it's just a mine under that highway? It's a pretty long stretch of road.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
yeah think I'll just avoid 80 altogether and go up to rt 23
They could theoretically shuttle a diesel engine back and forth between Mt. Arlington and Dover. Where would you put all the peoples' cars though?
How quick could they string up a few miles
Is that really why it doesn‚Äôt go to My Arlington? You would think they could extend the lines a little farther
They did know the severity, though! I don't want to accidentally dox myself, so all I'll say is my employer communicates with DOT. DOT leadership made it seem quite severe when the first sinkhole occurred and that 80 would be closed for an indeterminate amount of time due to the issue with the mines. That's why I was so shocked when it was filled 3 days later and wasn't addressed any further.
Much thanks! I will definitely try this
Idk just take 23 from 287 traffic will back up past Parsippany during rush¬†hour¬†
Knowing the bare minimum of what the system looks like out there would be helpful. Unfortunately, you know very little.

For one, this is a Hoboken line, not a NYC line. Zero Hudson River Tunnel capacity issues.

Second, MSU has 15 trains before 10am. Only 5 start from Netcong and just 4 start from Hacketstown.

Simply extending some of those trains in the morning would provide more service while again, not taking up any capacity. 

I implore you to please do the bare minimum of research next time before you embarrass yourself like this.
Correct.  This is a new hole far from the east bound ones
Its been eroding for awhile. Anyone who's smart isn't going near 34. Get off at 30 coming east or 35 going west
Appreciate the clarification that you used to enjoy it ü§£
they knew there were mines there - the state is in possession of the plans/maps, even over a century ago.  planning for route 80 started in the 1930s, people who worked in those mines could still have been alive at that point.  the locals were absolutely aware of the locations.
Yo im cackling.
Hoffa is down there
Plan for extra time any way especially if you go after 2PM. Husband took 2 hours to get from Wayne to Sparta 287 to 23 to Oak Ridge Rd last night.
On the coastline they have trains that do diesel and electric since half the line isn't electrified either
You‚Äôre talking about NJ Transit.  They couldn‚Äôt even specify windows that would survive being in sunlight.
I‚Äôm not an expert on nj transit but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs not that easy.
Huh, interesting, I guess they hoped for the best and got what was inevitably coming
Connecticut DOT rebuilt a bridge on a major roadway in about two to three months. NJDOT has been working on the route 15 south bridge for at least a year and is still not done.  DOT leadership is incompetent. Why did they wait a month to even start on the crossover. Everything they touch takes three times longer than surrounding states . PA has been expanding the northeast extension. They build ten miles of new lanes in the time NJ has been working on that rte 15 bridge.
Hacked bandaid shit is all these people know. Just fake it a few more years until you retire with a pension in North Carolina. They dgaf.
They may have thought they had more time to come up with a full plan and funding.  Planning something to that effect, with the detours, DOT, bidding process, ect takes a very long time.
The problem is that the sinkhole is by 15 so you'll have to sit in traffic to get there. You *could* take Exit 37 and take Greenpond Road all the way up to 23 but I don't know if you'd actually be saving time. At least you'd be moving.
[deleted]
Right. Giving directions doesn‚Äôt make a sinkhole discovered this very day ‚Äúweeks old news‚Äù though.
If the mine was even on a map, it was likely only the entrance and a general direction it went. They did super basic, very unreliable mapping underground mines until the late 1800's. The mine could very easily be from the 1700's for all we know. I have not seen a story that says the mine was known of ahead of time. Don't ever assume the government knows everything, that gives them way too much credit.
Was on train late last night, literally cannot see outside to figure out what station I was at and good luck deciphering the conductor over the speaker system. Those windows are trash.

Exotic vets that won‚Äôt cost me an arm and a leg.,"Hello! I'm an owner of multiple exotic pets, ranging from a hamster, guinea pigs, to a pigeon. I have a great regular clinic and vets that see them for regular, yearly care (I'm based in union county) but exotic emergency vets here are. Well. A little expensive. I've looked through threads, but all of them are 2+ years old and information seems to be outdated. I've been to Red Bank for emergency care and I honestly did not like them. Had a hamster who broke his leg, and they gave him a checkup, pain meds, euth for 850+, but if I picked to amputate the leg (I felt it wasn't worth it as he was old and it was risky) for 2.5k for surgery alone (back leg. In PA I've heard of it being like 450??) Totally unreasonable to me. That was in May 2023. I felt really weirded out by staff attitude as well.

VitalCheck Birth Certificates - Long or Short Form?,"Looking for insight as to what type of birth certificate is issued when you order from VitalCheck.

Ez pass violations,Looking to see if anyone has contacted an attorney for ez pass tickets or has any recommendations on who to use for something like this. It hasn‚Äôt been sent to collections and they refuse to listen to anything I have to say over the phone. And before anyone comments yes I know to hire a lawyer about this may be silly to some but I rather pay attorney fees than pay those scumbags any money. ,0.75,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jf6ozu/ez_pass_violations/,17,1jf6ozu,2025-03-19 20:19,"No. They‚Äôre insane and the level of penalties is way out of control. I had a mishap when I left my pass in the rental car and didn‚Äôt realize it, and got a bill for $1400. That‚Äôs usurious. If you decide to fight the good fight you‚Äôd have plenty of others to testify. I could have dealt with repaying the toll and a small penalty, but $50 per violation is insane.
It‚Äôs not silly. Fuck ez pass, they ticketed me for going through a toll plaza while being towed and even after I sent them proof and waited hours on hold on the phone they still sent it to collections. Forget the cost of a lawyer I just wanna make sure they don‚Äôt get a penny out of this lol
I actually tried opening an account but they were trying to have me say that I am still  liable for the fees prior to opening the account. I stopped immediately because I was not aware of a lot of the charges because I wasn't driving the vehicle.
There‚Äôs thousands of us in the same boat. EZ pass has ignored Phil Murphys law he enacted in 2023 stating that they must check for one‚Äôs account before assessing $50 administration fees. They are choosing to send out fees regardless without checking for accounts or contacting vehicle owners. 

I have accrued $1500 in fees apparently because when I updated my payment method (due to a change of my credit card because of fraud on the previous one), their incompetent employee told me it was successfully changed but apparently it was not. So they had no payment method on file without me knowing since I believed the employee when they said it was changed successfully. They did not check for an account of mine. They did not contact me about the payment method. They just waited until $1,000 fees built up, and mailed them all together weeks later.

Still disputing everything with them. But I‚Äôd rather give $1,500 to a lawyer to fight them on my behalf, instead of giving them $1,500 for fees illegally charged to me.
Btw they are suspending registrations and licenses. So don‚Äôt be surprise if your car gets impounded or you can‚Äôt renew your license. Neighbor friend just told me.
I had two cars. I sold my wifes car and mailed in the transponder. When I got my EZPass statement it showed that they charged me for going through a turnpike exit at 5am.

It was the transponder in a mail bag on a Post Office truck!!

It took a few weeks before the charge was removed.
Do you any ezpass account? If not, open one and pay with that account. They waive the fees.
I did something similar and paid just the rolls. I refused to pay the fees which amounted to over $2000 and the guys said they would reach out to setup a payment plan and I never heard from them. I recently found one of the toll by mail letters and it reminded me that I never heard anything and plugged it in and it said all .y tolls were paid and it didn't show a balance for the fees anymore. This was last summer.
The best part of them charging everyone outrageous amounts is that the company was sold to Singapore for $1.73 billion üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. OK so you want me to pay you over $1000 for $30 worth of tolls and then on top of that this money is going where exactly because you sold it to another country.
Basically, the same thing happened to me. They changed the replenish amount. My card declined. I called and changed it. They then increased the replenishment amount for the third time (for 100$ that‚Äôs absolutely insane) wasn‚Äôt aware my card declined. Got a piece of mail the other day from a collections account that said 24 violations and called EZ Pass to figure out what was going on. The man on the phone just wanted to argue kept repeating himself told me multiple times over and over again you need to get on a payment plan. I said to him if this can‚Äôt be resolved, I‚Äôm going to get legal representation and his response was ‚Äúgood luck with that mam‚Äù. I understand it‚Äôs not the representatives fault but if you think I‚Äôm joking, I‚Äôm not I really will get a lawyerüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ. By the end of the call I asked him for a supervisor he put me on hold for 30 minutes and I hung up. 

So they want me to pay $1243 for 24 violations that are $1.40 each. Ok so I owe you $30.40 and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll pay how does that even compare to $1243. Ive done some research on lawyers that deal with this and a lot of them advertise fighting once you hit the collection stage or once your license and registration is suspended. Which hasn‚Äôt happened to me, but I agree with you. I have money and refuse to give it to those scumbags. I rather give the lawyer $1243. It‚Äôs the principle 

I spoke to my sister last night and she showed me a news report in 2022 where one of the New Jersey Congressmen had multiple violations through mail. Complained about how much they are costing the state by sending unnecessary paper to people who already have an account and fought to create a new law to NOT send $50 violations to account holders. She suggested filing a complaint to our congressman Jeff Van Drew (south jersey). She has done this before with a different issue and their team resolved the whole thing and she didn‚Äôt owe them a penny. I don‚Äôt know if this will work with EZ Pass, but im working on writing a sob story in hopes they can do something about it.
They can only do that if you don't pay the tolls. They can't do anything about $50 fees but send you to collections.
I tried this a few days ago and they have a statement saying that, I am still responsible for old fees that's about $1700. I stopped signing up immediately.
I hope it does work for both of us. When I spoke to someone, they offered to cut my fees in half, and I still said no. I‚Äôm not paying administrative fees when they shouldn‚Äôt have been issued. And I‚Äôm not waiting until my license is suspended. I need my license for work and can‚Äôt afford to do that. So I‚Äôm disputing it all til then. 

The law Murphy enacted in 2023 is (S-646/A-823). Here is a news article that explains it as well:

https://www.tapinto.net/towns/piscataway/sections/government/articles/under-new-law-e-zpass-will-now-have-to-check-customer-accounts-prior-to-issuing-violations-4a0ca44b-6e12-41fa-b8e8-cbb1e65e904e
So if you pay the tolls and not the fees you good on suspensions ? Are you sure
Well if your license gets suspended and you can‚Äôt go to work you can sue them for lost wages too
Yes, the state just wants to tolls. The fees are EZ Pass being greedy cunts.
Okay, I got more information if you don‚Äôt pay the amount you owe tolls and fees included. Your vehicle registration and license is going to be suspended."

EZ pass transponder issues,"I recently traveled to Florida, rented a car and carried the EZ pass NJ transponder to Florida.  I placed the transponder on the rental car dash board and it worked fine at some toll booths.  I noticed toll charges on my account, but after a month I received a tolls violation notice from rental car.  The FL toll company did not address my issue, they asked me to check with the car rental company and EZ pass.  

The car rental company charged me $90 for a $6 toll.  

Sometimes the transponder will not record due to several issues like old battery, not enough battery juice, or transponder not installed properly on the dashboard.  To avoid these issues, **enter the rental car license plate in your EZ pass account.**  The EZpass customer service kept me waiting on phone for 20 minutes and then informed that I did not list the license plate in my account.

I've noticed significantly more police activity and traffic stops in the past few weeks.  Especially along Route 1 and Route 18.
pulling over people doing below the speed limit in passing lanes would likely cut the amount of people aggressively trying to get around them. Not a full solution but ever since Covid ended its like the a lot people love sitting in the passing lane causing a massive backup.
Snowflake cops
I was driving on the turnpike going west and at one point, you couldn't go a mile without seeing someone pulled over. I thought it was weird.
Soon as Trump won they started busting balls again. Like the next day.
What I don't understand if you give them cause to pull you over and they can prove it on dash cam why is it suddenly a race issue? If they pull you over for no reason at all and it can be proven via dash camera then yeah it's a problem.  At the end of the day there's plenty of terrible driving in general
Welcome to New Jersey, where it's illegal to pump your own gas but we let the cops do whatever they want.
The cops on 287 have been very busy the last couple weeks.
It‚Äôs pretty simple. Cops don‚Äôt know how to not be racist when making stops, so they decided to just not stop anyone. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable for cops to say: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre unclear what the state is defining as racially biased so we‚Äôre going to curtail stops so we don‚Äôt get in trouble‚Äù

What‚Äôs not good is that they make seem to make no effort to understand or change their biases or resist attempts at education or training.
It was a ‚Äúbias‚Äù training exercise. Legislation in NJ changed, now a public employee/official can be charged for violating someone‚Äôs 14th amendment rights if there‚Äôs evidence of biased behavior. Troopers are figuring out how to keep their people safe, while the state comes out with these ‚Äúclown party tactics‚Äù to reduce incidents of excessive force.

It can potentially keep police and first responders safe, but it also gives more free rein to petty criminal activity because you cannot police the way you used to based on observation and experience. That includes speeding.
Is always hard to support the blue, but we have to tolerate them as they do an important/stressful job for society.
AfTeR cOviD tHe dRiViNg has bEEn cRAZy

Yeah we know‚Ä¶.
had a cop about a week ago driving next to me on route 46 in parsippany, slam the brakes on his car and put in reverse (why not just merge) to pull me over and grill me for not wearing a seatbelt. 

I handed him my license and registration with a PBA card and he started grilling me asking who the officer was, what relation I was to him, where I know him from, etc and when I froze and said ""I'm not sure officer, I just pulled it out of my wallet. I don't even know which one I gave you, see here's three more."" 

The officer starts grilling me about those cards too, and I'm like ""honestly they're family friends, without reading the cards and seeing the signature I couldn't tell you which one came from which officer. You can just write me the ticket if you want"" and he came back and begrudgingly gave me a written warning.
""Well, if i can't harrass black people then I'm just not going to do my job. I mean, how do i even identify a white reckless driver.""
People get upset at other professions because them not doing their job has actual negative affects on society. Police stop writing tickets, life goes on just fine.
Teachers gave up around ~2005 when everyone started saying, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the teachers fault if the kid fails.‚Äù ¬†Now we just show up, ¬†babysit, ¬†pass everyone and gamble on our phones. ¬†

So why don‚Äôt you take that dumb sentiment somewhere else. ¬†When people fault you, ¬†when you are doing your job, ¬†you stop doing your job. ¬†Literally anyone would do that in the same situation.
What if some groups do break more traffic laws than others. Really need an independent organization to verify that to prove it was actually racial bias.
In some places here in NJ they've stopped writing tickets for parking violations.¬†


People parked up to every corner? Check.


People parked in front of every fire hydrant? Also a check.


Consequences if a pedestrian gets struck due to poor visibility of a cross walk or someone dying in a fire? Not for the cops!
There you go bringing up the left lane again.
It‚Äôs been like that for two or three weeks, it‚Äôs crazy. I counted 7 people pulled over from exit 151 to exit 129 on the parkway yesterday morning.
Because they don't want to pull over white people who violate the law. The whole reason they became cops was to oppress minorities. Cruelty is the point
Sure there's plenty of terrible driving, from all races, but if only drivers if a certain race get tickets, that's an issue. The concern isn't they are pulling people over for no reason, the concern is they are pulling people over with race being a reason along with the the violation being a reason.
I‚Äôll support them when they have accountability. Right now they just do whatever they want with no consequences. With power comes responsibility and if they don‚Äôt want the responsibility, fuck them.
You wouldn‚Äôt be talking like that if it was your family member murdered on rt 37 or 55.
They should throw the book at people like you who try to get out of tickets because of who you know.
By grilling do you mean he literally asked a question? lol
I kinda like the ideas of traffic laws being enforced. People who drive recklessly or do stupid things on the road need some kind of deterrent. The only thing keeping us alive on the road are some painted white lines and a social contract.
I mean 690 people died in New Jersey auto fatalities last year and already over 100 in 2025. In a functioning society police would be working to lower those figures but instead they‚Äôre throwing a tantrum.
>  Police stop writing tickets, life goes on just fine.

Are you suggesting traffic enforcement is not a 6 figure worthy job? Maybe our conception of police and policing needs to modernize to meet our needs...
Have you driven lately? The roads are fucking insane!
Your problem is your critical thinking on Reddit. Most in This sub just want another ‚Äúcop bad‚Äù post.
Traffic and reckless driving sucks but you‚Äôre essentially right. For the most part everything will function
Did you read the article? It said a rise in collisions coincided almost immediately when the downturn in tickets started. That strongly suggests the lack of enforcement has an actual negative effect on society. I get how over policing can have different negative effects as well, but it would appear ticketing has a beneficial safety effect in terms of reducing collisions.
Teacher stop failing kids, ¬†everyone is a dumbass, ¬†but they all have diplomas‚Ä¶. Wooooooo!!!
I have four speeding tickets and one for an obstructive plate because the last three letters of garden State was blocked by the dealer frame. All those tickets were given to me by white cops And I'm a white person. This is why I keep waze on Because all these cops care about is generating revenue especially small towns
Friend of mine got rear ended by a female cop, he said he went to get out of the car and she told him get back in, two minutes later 15-20 other cops show up and tell him to go around the corner and wait, few minutes later they come and give him a court date.

 I understand the ""brotherhood"", but when you collectively just protect each other no matter what it's a problem.
Or 22, or 78 or 287 or 95 or 195 or 33.
That is such a wierd flex.¬† This guy is so important i bet he has a vanity plate too.
God forbid I respectfully give the officer the documents they request and even tell them I‚Äôll take the ticket.

It‚Äôs been just under yen years since I was last pulled over. 

What exactly do you propose they charge me with when they throw the book at me?
No, his tone was aggressive and agitated when he asked ""who is this person? who is it? do you know who this is? how do you know this person? do you know who this?""  It changed immediately after I gave him  the PBA card. Prior to that he was very calm and mild with his voice.

I get they have a hard job, and I'm not trying to be snappy and short with him. Once he inspected the license, insurance, and registration, he got to the card and got angry. I remained calm and respectful throughout the whole ordeal. He cooled off toward the end though.
I agree, but the State police's own data doesn't support them having any real effect. In 10 years, the difference between high year and low year is 100 fatalities, the mean is 605 and the standard deviation is 64. Its not great that they are that high, but it doesn't really look like the actions of the police is really doing much to influence this.
Ticketing people for doing 70 in a 65 does nothing lol.
And in 2021, when cops were writing tickets, the fatality rate was 697, so what is the functional difference from the cops working or not working?

If anything that just shows that theres people on the road especially post COVID that should not be driving. I seen a spike of idiots ranging from car drivers to truck drivers doing some of the most dangerous things and a lot of them had temporary plates from New Jersey and student driver stickers meanwhile it's an old person in the car
I have, and its been like that for more than 8 months. The police not writing tickets for 8 months is not the cause of that.
I haven't seen a blinker in years, and the increasingly popular hard swerve from left lane directly into your exit is really annoying.
That's true everywhere and likely one of many lingering behavioral symptoms of the pandemic.

10 years of data here does not show a statistical link to not writing tickets and increases in crashes.
Traffic enforcement is a very different animal than regular ""police work"". Automated enforcement would go a very long way towards making our roads a safer place to be.
Damn, now I'm curious how psychotically you were driving that a bunch of cops would put the joy of oppressing minorities on hold so they could stop you.
lol that didn‚Äôt happen
Or the parkway or the turnpike or rt 10 or rt 46 or rt 206 or rt 53 or rt 23 or rt 202 or rt 94 or rt 73 or rt 55 or rt 109
Self-entitlement, for some reason they've decided knowing a bunch of police has entitled them to not get tickets.
Nobody asked if you have friends or family that are police. That should not matter, everyone should be treated the same.
That‚Äôs just one stat, I wonder what overall accidents and injuries look like
There‚Äôs so many confounding factors. That 10 years includes COVID. 

Ultimately ticketing people doesn‚Äôt prevent accidents directly, but if people think twice before doing something stupid on the road that‚Äôs good enough for me. The only way to prevent all accidents is to make all cars self driving or have cameras and cops everywhere which is obviously not a solution. 

Tons of accidents people get into aren‚Äôt caused by reckless driving or anything but are simply misjudgments. A lot of times substances are involved. It‚Äôs just too many factors. 

Nevermind all the cars without plates, with fake plates, no insurance, window tints etc. For a while there, anecdotally, it seemed like none of this was getting enforced.
I‚Äôm not saying they were doing a good job in 2021, or at any other point in my life. It seems pretty clear that they‚Äôve always used traffic stops as a pretext for harassing people, not actually making anyone safer. Just saying there is a function police issuing tickets is supposed to serve.
They stopped writing tickets during the ""defund the police "" movement during covid. Apathy on their part. Danger for us.
These are the issues that need to be addressed more than speeding. Changing lanes is the most dangerous time during driving due to speed differentials and blind spots.


The parkway was designed and engineered to be a 75MPH road the whole way, the speed is artificially lowered. That's why people generally drive 75 on it when there isn't traffic, that's what it was made for.
Am I overlooking something?  I don't see any information about rates of tickets issued in any of those links. You need that information to make a comparison. How would I know which time periods more or fewer tickets were issued?
His court date says otherwise, but OK.
Accidents are about the same. It's a bit scary how one to one they are.
Covid is represented in that data, if anything it should be thrown out for being artificially low. Claiming confounds are an issue kind of proves the point that ticketing does nothing.

The claim being made is that during the 8th months that they haven't been writing tickets there should be a spike in fatalities, but the data doesn't show a significant jump in that.
If he was rear ended by a cop, he would 100% be not at fault in any accident. The law literally says you need to leave space to stop. So your friend didn‚Äôt get a ticket because the cops know that. But enjoy your Reddit karma because ‚Äúacab‚Äù
If someone asked me how to prevent road fatalities, ‚Äúmore ticketing‚Äù would not be my first choice. More presence, more stopping, more warnings maybe. Actually, I wonder how much someone being pulled over but not cited affects the data? 

It‚Äôs really not interesting but now I‚Äôm thinking too much
Not a response to what I‚Äôm actually saying. The current system is completely broken, no disagreement, tear it to the ground and start over. But we should want a world with actual enforcement of traffic laws. There‚Äôs a reason Vision Zero has enforcement as one of its components. The police not actually doing their jobs costs people their lives.

I can't find the year by year data set but the 2018 numbers were 175,000 speeding tickets issued. Parsing through the numbers, 
as of 2022, summonses were down 46% from the year prior. That seems to jive with my timeline.
Going back again through the conversation thread, I didn't see anyone make that claim.  Some of the claims you responded to at the start are 

>Just saying there is a function police issuing tickets is supposed to serve.

>In a functioning society police would be working to lower those figures but instead they‚Äôre throwing a tantrum


And my claim (well more me repeating the articles claim)

>a rise in collisions coincided almost immediately when the downturn in tickets started

I think you might be reading too much into what people are trying to say.

There are also other factors to consider. Ticketing can indeed reduce collisions, but other factors can increase collisions and data would reflect both of those patterns. It's not controlled for anything with your analysis.
My whole reply was following OP stating they have no accountability, obviously rear ending someone puts you at fault, key point being they collectively protected the officer who was at fault.. Ya know? . Referencing the whole no accountability thing? Not sure how that went over your head, but if you don't believe me you sure as fuck wouldn't belive when cops destroyed my car and left me stranded, broke my taillight because they were pissed they didn't find weed and wanted to ticket me for something, bashed me (the passenger) over the head with a flashlight the second they pulled my door open when my friend got pulled over for speeding, or any other of the real shit that has personality happened to me in my history with law enforcement. Doesn't mean it didn't happen...
And if traffic enforcement does not actually lower numbers, its unreasonable to claim that traffic enforcement will lower numbers. Saying the police not doing their job by not writing tickets is costing lives is demonstrability false when the data show that even when they were writing tickets people were dying in equal or greater numbers.
Agreed! We seriously need police reform everywhere! 

The other day, I had someone tailgating me so close then swerve into the next lane when she barely had space then sped off. Within 5 minutes, I could no longer see her car. There was a trooper who ended up flying out of his spot and was gone in a minute or two, but I don't know if they were going after the gitl who was driving like the turnpike Nascar. I never saw them pulled over at any point. 

But it's seriously dangerous, and I agree with you that they're throwing a tantrum to getting caught for being racially biased. 

While repairing the system, we need to do better with screening officers and reprimanding those who truly have done wrong vs it getting brushed under the rug.

And fatalities in 2017 was just a bit lower than it was in 2022. So even if they stopped writing tickets in 2018, it had negligible affect
The topic started with OP mentioning that the police haven't been writing tickets for 8 months, that's where the 8 months comes from.

>a rise in collisions coincided almost immediately when the downturn in tickets started

You're claiming this, but you've not provided data to back that up. When did collisions rise?
Your right I don‚Äôt believe any of this fairy tale lol
What data are your referring to? This article says the data the NYTimes obtained for the period of the ticket slow down Indictates crashes increased.
Quantity doesn‚Äôt equal quality though is my point. They can write a billion tickets for ticky tack violations or they could write 100 for the most egregious violations and the latter would protect us more. I‚Äôm not advocating that we go back to where we were five or ten years ago, but there‚Äôs clearly a problem with traffic fatalities in this country and enforcing traffic laws properly is one of the ways we should look at reducing them. When police just don‚Äôt do that it means people die, and when they treat traffic tickets as a revenue source and not a safety measure like they used to, people also die. We shouldn‚Äôt give up on a system that actually priorities our safety.
Deaths aren't the only consequences to non-policing. Look at what's happened to car insurance rates in our state. They were always high, but they've gone bonkers.
But where did the ""there should be a spike in fatalities"" come from? OP or the original comments you replied to didn't make that claim. I'm not questioning the 8 month period.

Like I said I'm repeating the claim the the NJ.com article made characterizing the NYTimes article. You can read the NY times article if you'd like more info on the data they used. I generally trust this source on a matter like this. Do you not trust them in this case, and if not what concern should I have about them?
Refer to the links I posted on your other comment
People are not discouraged from committing crimes by penalties, they‚Äôre discouraged by the certainty that they‚Äôll be caught. If people knew you‚Äôd get punished for speeding, they wouldn‚Äôt speed. Simply picking the worst offenders will never make a dent in the amount of fatal crashes.

https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/five-things-about-deterrence
The problem is you're advocating for a system that you've already admitted doesn't work. If the system doesn't work, stop using it and find a better one.
Goal shifting
> But where did the ""there should be a spike in fatalities"" come from? 

I follow the train of thought, if the rate of collisions increases uniformly then so would the incident of extreme collisions in addition to all other intensities if a normal distribution. Given that you would still see an increase in deaths due to extreme collisions also increasing as the whole set of collisions increased.  Again that is assuming number of collisions increase was normally distributed but you would notice an increase if you controlled for the absolute number of deaths and not seeing an increase in absolute deaths is worth exploring further.  Maybe low collision accidents increased or something else, but if it there was an absolute increase that was normally distributed we would see it in the absolute number of deaths.
None of them have any data on tickets issued.
No, I'm advocating for a system we've never actually tried.
My goal is safer roads. Your point is that since im alive, the roads are safe enough for me? Again, fatalities aren't the only metric when it comes to safe driving. 

Anyone who's driven the last few years has seen the deterioration of societal norms behind the wheel. Not sure if more policing would help, but its plain to see the inverse isn't the answer either.
> I follow the train of thought, if the rate of collisions increases uniformly then so would the incident of extreme collisions in addition to all other intensities if a normal distribution.

I think you need to take a step back further and realize that even if police tickets do have a minimizing effect on collisions, that's just one thing of the many things that have an effect on collisions.  Sure, the type of collisions is something to consider, that's certainly part of why I called it out, we don't know that effect. but even if we take for granted that collisions and fatalities have a uniform trajectory, who says some other factor isn't canceling out the police ticket factor?  maybe the police gave out fewer tickets, which has an increasing effect on collisions, but also we had much less snow than average, which can have a decreasing effect on collisions.  What's the net effect on collisions, positive or negative?  We can't say, without doing a proper analysis controlling for the variable we want to identify, but apparently the other poster doesn't feel that's necessary, they feel they can look at just fatalities and assume the effect any given variable has on them, in this case, no effect.
And the claim being presented is that suddenly they are not writing tickets in the last 8 months, meaning that previously they were issuing them. If you have data that says they were not writing tickets in a time period greater than 8 months, then present it, but so far only data saying its been 8 months has been presented.
Redesigning roadways has done more for reducing injuries and fatalities than policing has ever done
False dichotomy 

Also, if you actually look at the data I posted you'll see that collisions are also all over the place, regardless of if police are writing tickets or not. 

As far as the societal norms behind the wheel, from my experience the only thing that would improve things is if people were stripped of their license and required to retest. People moving their vehicles out into areas they can damn well see they can't clear in time trying to make turns is not going to be fixed by issuing a ticket. I literally saw someone last night attempt to make a left turn by pulling out into the road, block it for east bound traffic because there were people going west bound. That is a person that should have their right to drive revoked until they can prove they are competent to drive again.
Right but was the rates of tickets consistent all the previous years? Also the time period in question started mid year and went into a second year. So the data reflects variable ticketing rates during those times. The data you are looking at isn't seperate to make that analysis
I agree and I'm 110% in favor of that being our main approach. Plus just more transit friendly policies that get cars off the road would also help more than enforcement. All I've been trying to say is that good traffic enforcement where the priority is the safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians would save lives as well and we shouldn't be okay living in a world where we pay police and they don't do that, and that I don't believe that was ever a priority even when the quantity of tickets was much higher.
While I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiment, I do believe that the harshness of such a penalty could really fuck up someone's life. You lose your license, you lose insurance, you lose your job potentially and then your home. The shit I see daily blows my mind and with seeminly no consequence other than stress on me!
It also doesn't statistically vary that much over a 10 year run
It is harsh, unreasonably harsh, but for people to be driving like that where the consequences are clear and far more detrimental than a ticket, I do not see people getting ticketed changing that behavior. Like, if you are willing to jump out into cross traffic knowing you could kill yourself or someone else, a ticket isn't going to impact that behavior.
The difference between the high and low is over 100 fatalities. I'd definitely consider that varying a lot.
And the mean fatality rate over that 10 year run is 605, with a standard deviation of 64. The peak year of 697 is just a bit under 1.5 standard deviations from the norm. Not statistically significant to say anything is happening that is abnormal.
Again, what level of statistical significance are you using? What percentage? Because I'd cite what you just said as evidence there is significant variation during that 10 year period. But if we are using different standards, there isn't much point to discussing this further. I'd say more than a 5% change is certainly statistically significant.
Standard deviations [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard\_deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation), anything under 2 standard deviations is considered a statistically insignificant of an event happening. 

Or to put it another way, a year with 697 is just as likely to occur as a year where you see 510. There is no actual events or influences going on.
No I mean what alpha value are you using and what P value did you get?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance

But there are many fields that would consider less than 2 standard deviations statistically significant. The standards vary depending on who's doing the analysis, but setting an alpha of more than 5% is less common.
Not even bothering with that because there is no indication of any change going on. If one year there was a jump to say to 720 or a continuous increase (or decrease) that would be something, but you don't see that. It goes up, it goes down, there is nothing to indicate there is any pattern. Like the only two data points that show anything interesting is the 2020/2021 points where you see a jump of almost 100 and the 2022/2023/2024 points where you see a drop of nearly 80 only to come back.

We already know what happened in 2020, be interesting to see what happened in 2023 to see it drop that much in one year.
There was apparently an increase in crashes during the low ticketing period in question, I'd say that is an indicator of change.
It would be, if 2024 didn't match 2022. So either the police weren't ticketing in 2022 and 2021, and only ticketed in 2023, or ticketing has no bearing and something else potentially happened in 2023
Or ticketing has some bearing and other things happened in 2023 (and every other year) many things happen every year that influence fatalities. You don't control for any other influences in your analysis.
Okay, provide information to prove that. Since you admitted the 2024 was the time period that ticketing wasn't happening and any time before that was, the data I provided on fatalities on the road doesn't support ticketing as lowering fatalities
No, it was an 8 period starting on July 2023. I never said the year 2024 ticketing wasn't happening. You are making up my words at this point.

You're right though your data doesn't support ticketing being correlated with fatalities. You don't provide any data on ticketing. That's why it's incomplete data.  You can't say there is no correlation or there is a correlation with your data. Your data doesn't mention ticketing at all.
Okay, you're right, you didn't say 2024 and the article said 2023. You are right that there is no ticketing data, but the crashes and fatalities data does not show any pattern changes other than a slow increase over 10 years, with the exception of a significant drop in 2020 and 2023. It is completely possible to look at data and go ""there is no trend, there is no pattern, there is no anomaly, its all normally distributed"" with out having to compare it to other data to find a pattern.
You literally do have to compare it to other data to confidently say there is no correlation. You need two things to compare to say there is a correlation. How can you say there is no connection to something else when you don't know anything about that something else? If ticketing rose and fell at exactly the same percentages year after year compared to the fatalities, you would say there is no connection?
Fatalities aren't going up and down at anything other than a normal distribution would expect. Most change from year to year is barely half a standard deviation
So? You can still have a strong correlation if the thing you are correlating it to varies just the same. For example, the weather is correlates with collisions, Yea? With snow and ice causing more collisions? You are saying because there is a normal distribution there is no correlation with weather and collisions. That's obviously not the case.
And if weather varies by a normal distribution and there is a document 8 month period where there was no rain but collisions didn't change (or even more dramatic, collisions went down) , would you say weather is correlated with collisions? This is the scenario you are arguing
No I'm not, you presented 12 month periods, not 8 month periods. You also didn't present anything that suggests prior to the 8 month period ticketing varied by a normal distribution. Same way you would see the increase specifically when it snows, you might see an increase specifically when ticketing stopped in the years you cited but your data isn't that specific. Similarly if you only collect a yearly average for weather instead of daily conditions, you won't have a pattern emerge. Maybe if you had monthly data within 2023 or 2024 you would see a significant difference. I trust the NYTimes looked at that data.
And you've not presented anything that suggests anything is going on.
I am pointing to this article, again, I suggest you read it. Did you see what it said? Collisions increased shortly after ticketing decreased.
Are you talking about the article OP posted, if so it says that time period was from the middle of 2023 till March 2024
Yes, it says collisions increased and ticketed was reduced during that time
So let's think about this one a bit. 2023 had much lower accidents and fatalities, than in 2022 and 2024, per state police reports. Want to explain how if collisions increased the year wound up with fewer accidents than then the year before or after?
No, I do t want to explain it. I trust the NYTimes to explain it, and that's not the time period in question. Do you want to explain to me why they say from shortly after July 20203 when the alleged ticketing stoppage began collisions increased?
So did the NY Times explain why 2023, despite having no ticketing half the year, had fewer accidents despite claiming collisions increased?
No,  why would they? We aren't talking about all of 2023
How about because it makes no logical sense. If ticketing stopped in July of 2023, last 8 months, than it stands to reason that ticketing was happening in 2022, the first half of 2023, and the last 10 months of 2024. If ticketing legitimately increased collisions and therefore accidents, 2023 should have seen MORE accidents, not less, the data from the NJ State police does not support that
Why would they explain a range if time that the news article isn't about? Are you saying their claim is inaccurate? That's all you have to say. I trust them more than I trust you and the state data you provide isn't narrowed to the time period in question yet you are treating it like collisions are uniform though the whole year. They definitely happen more in the snow season, at least in my experience with auto body repair.
Buddy, I want you to think really hard on this, how could an increase in collisions through half the year result in a year with lower collisions than they year before or after? How is that physically possible?
Still not answering the question when it's like the third time I asked, lol.
Buddy, I don't do this often but I'm just going to concede this argument on account of you just being too stupid to understand
Do you not understand what the article is trying to say. Maybe if we break it into halves something like this happened. 2022- 200+ 100 = 300 fatalities total. 2023 - 100+  175 = 275 fatalities total. Notice how it's physically possible to have a lower year total but a higher total for the time period in question. You seem to be having trouble with the concept of time and 2023 isn't the same as July/august2023-february 2024
Wild how you believe a statement that wasn't supported by any numbers but will just make up numbers when published numbers do not support a newspapers statement. Somewhere Occam is cutting himself with that razor because of how bad you understand things.
Wild how you said you were going to concede and then proceed to continue.
Yeah, I did concede, now I'm just laughing at you"

It's COVID dawg, everyone has COVID.
Anyone else getting post nasal drips and mild chest congestions?
Pollen is here.  Went to grill burgers last night and there was a coat of pollen on the lid.  Moved back to my nightly xyzal earlier than I thought.
M windshield has had a light yellow dusting several days in a row now‚Ä¶it‚Äôs absolutely allergy season!
Definitely. Though my seasonal allergy season is January to November so I've been taking my allergy meds for a while
I saw some trees with buds starting on them.
Mine started two days ago. I thought that it was from controlled burns near me but I  guess it's pollen of some kind.
Yup - about a week ago mine started
It's actually easing up a bit for me, but I have been congested from 2/27 to yesterday but no other cold symptoms.
Pollen count alert today.   Get the WeatherBug app and it will alert you.   8.1 todays Cedar, Juniper, Elm and Maple today
I started feeling them over a week ago. I wasn't 100% sure at first but the symptoms never developed or got worse, and it correlated with the warm weather. Got on Flonase and it cleared right up. So yeah, it's time lol
The trees are starting so yes
The trees are starting so yes
started on Monday Itchy eyes and sneezing
Yes

Yup! I started my annual allergy meds when I got a migraine that first warmish week.
I have Itchy eyes and that windless dry cough.
Pollen levels are high.

I downloaded a pollen app for my phone so I can keep track and stay inside if necessary.

Is all of North Plainfield unsafe to live or walk a dog at night?,"I'm looking around for a new apartment and found a few places in North Plainfield. I'm reading around and the general consensus seems to be that Plainfield itself is bad while South Plainfield can be very nice. North Plainfield seems to be a mix. The places I'm looking at are near US 22 and there's a Costco less than a mile away with tons of other businesses and restaurants along the road. From this, it seems to me that this could be one of the safer parts of North Plainfield. I walk my dog at night a lot because of my daily schedule so safety is a priority for me. ",0.27,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jf0xx1/is_all_of_north_plainfield_unsafe_to_live_or_walk/,9,1jf0xx1,2025-03-19 16:23,"Damn, I lived in NP my entire life and graduated from high school there and I personally never found it dangerous enough I couldn't go out on a walk at night. Surprised others feel it's dangerous.
I've never felt unsafe in North Plainfield. Lived here my whole life, delivered pizza late at night, everything's been fine. 

Even Plainfield isn't as bad as it used to be.
I don't live in NP but my wife works in the district as a teacher. She isn't walking around at night but has had to be there late at night (for a teacher) plenty of times. She has never verbalized being unsafe in the district or with any of the parents of the students either. She hasn't told me of any major issues in the town either. 

  
Like a lot of towns, there are areas that are safer than others, so I'm not saying it is 100% safe. But i have heard way more issues about schools being closed for flooding than any crime related concerns.
Just my opinion, but I'd rather be on the other side in Warren off King George Road.
The last time I drove through there, i saw someone with a gun hanging out the backseat window. Some places you only go if you have no choice. I can't imagine living there!
Is Warren a safer area?
I keep reading mixed things about North Plainfield. Plainfield itself is universally agreed upon to be an unsafe area, but N Plainfield seems to be a mixed bag of ""it's very good"" and ""avoid at all costs"".
Warren is smaller, more affluent & more rural and I'd be willing to bet it is much safer.
I'll check out Warren and see what's out there. Thanks!"

High pitched ringing noise last night (Monmouth county),"Last night at 9:30-9:35 in Farmingdale my friends and I were looking at planets using a star map app.  Shorty after we stopped my friend asked if we heard a high pitched ringing noise coming from across the street.

But when I turned and dropped my hood it was LOUD, and obviously coming from a specific direction.  If we moved our heads it would fade or disappear completely.

Are there big differences within subareas of Bridgewater?,"I am thinking about moving to Bridgewater from another town in NJ. When I research the areas, I noticed that the elementary schools have drastically different [Greatschools.org](http://Greatschools.org) ratings. I usually don't interpret the ratings that much, as they tend to be inaccurate - a rating 6 school can be as good as a rating 8 school.

However, when comparing schools with 8 or 9 vs 3, most cases I would expect night and day differences.

Here are the ratings in their prek-4 elementary schools:

Van Holten (9/10); Crim (8/10); Bradley Gardens (8/10); Hamilton (8/10); Adamsville (5/10); JFK (3/10).

How come there is such a huge difference within the same school district? Am I missing something? (Even if JFK serves both Bridgewater and Raritan, they are still the same high school district)

Also, I heard some people advice against the Bradley Gardens area. Is there anything about Bradley Gardens that I should be prepared if moving there?

Thank you all!",0.4,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jezadr/are_there_big_differences_within_subareas_of/,8,1jezadr,2025-03-19 15:13,"JFK serves only Raritan, which is more of a town compared to the rest of Bridgewater. Adamsville serves the Findere section of Bridgewater. Bradley Gardens is fine. It‚Äôs considered to be the more ‚Äúworking class‚Äù area of Bridgewater than up the mountain where Van Holten, Hamilton, and Crim are.
There are big differences.  Bridgewater care most about the mountain.
Thank you so much!
Are you referring to north of 22? Or a more specific, small area is ""the mountain""?
Pretty sure they‚Äôre referring to Martinsville where the wealthy live
Up the hill, basically.  And to be more specific, Bridgewater certainly doesn't care much for ""East Bridgewater,"" which to me are the areas east of Finderne Avenue (streets names after cars).  Bridgewater doesn't care much for Finderne, especially east of Finderne but south of East Main, out to Foothill Road.  Bridgewater also doesn't really think much about Bradley Gardens, but it also feels connected from the rest of BW, so I get it.

I say this because Bridgewater has a history of making decisions that favor the mountain but aren't so great for other areas.  I say this having spent 10+ years living on the mountain, watching how the bungled the Mosque, watching the things they've done lately with the Center for Excellence, etc.

And Adamsville is in what I would consider East Bridgewater, and JFK kinda falls into that as well.  I'm surprised that BG school is so highly rated, all things considered, although there is one section of BG that's pretty nice (where a former mayor lives, dunno if it's coincidence).  

All that being said, it's a nice town, I grew up pretty all right.  Just some parts are definitely nicer than others.
Thank you so much for this detailed information.

Can you give one example that a decision favoring the mountain? Related to schools? Or infrastructure?
The town spent $7m of taxpayer money to avoid putting a mosque on Mountaintop Road."

When President Biden would come, it would be a max of 3 SS vehicles joined by a PANYNJ police escort on the airfield, in and out quick, ground stop for about 10 minutes.  The troopers and other agencies would wait outside the secure airfield, as to minimize commercial traffic disruption.

i'm pretty sure obama had the same as biden more or less. i remember being on the turnpike by the airport and seeing af1 land there back in 2016 when obama came to rutgers to deliver the commencement address. that was honestly really cool to see.
People liked Joe Biden as a person.
 Well he had two assassination    attempts on him. Why is this surprising?
His trips to court appearances in NYC a few years ago was a giant snaking auto show of a convoy, nothings changed.
Well unlike the others there was an assassination attempt on Trump, so i cant really complain about how much more protection he feels he needs. However, its definitely still annoying as fuck to deal with something like that.
It shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that the guy who‚Äôs had 2 assassination attempts in the past year has more security than the guy who‚Äôs had 0.
Maybe that has to do with the assassination attempt of trump less than a year ago.
The fact that none of his golf courses has collapsed into a portal to Hell is how I know there's no God.

I guess because the airport property extends almost to Rt 10 by the golf center and Lexus dealership. They probably want to cover security from that side too.
Main runway extends towards both rt 10 and rt 24 (Colombia turnpike included). During landing and boarding and stuff the state troopers block the roads.
That‚Äôll show em‚Äô!
I wish I could even understand. Is that why trump got elected? Because people need to be told what to do?   I mean this guy is literally closing roads and causing issues in our part of the country because he needs government to pay for his golf.
Trump travels with considerably more people than Biden did, and charges the government for the services he's using at the golf course that he owns, at a jacked up price.
No offense, and by that I mean all the offense in the world.  You're an idiot.  There is literally nothing good about the modern republican party.  They are CONSTANTLY breaking laws ever since inauguration and before that there are literally reams of data that say that the Democratic party is better for the country from an economic standpoint.

So kindly GFY.

Because he's a rapist and a felon? Why does he deserve any respect?
Yes this subreddit is anti Trump. Post your Biden hate if you want but he doesn‚Äôt come to our state wasting taxpayer dollars to funds his golfing addiction so it really doesn‚Äôt apply, does it?

I like how people come on here with opinions like this pretending this is just a totally normal administration. Trump has been violating the constitution and ignoring court orders to a much worse extent than any other president in US history. If you like it, that doesn't make it a good thing. He is an authoritarian. If you like authoritarianism when he does it, that's not a good thing. If a third of the voting population likes it, IT IS STILL NOT A GOOD THING. The republican party today is a far-right extremist organization, so they and their supporters should be treated appropriately.

In simpler terms, the facists can eat shit.

So make a post about the republican talking points you support? No one is stopping you from being an active member of this forum. But consider that maybe, just maybe, if you're feeling ostracized for your political perspective, you should reexamine your political perspective.
Don‚Äôt have shitty opinions and you won‚Äôt get shit on.
Just letting you know what is a going on in NJ. If you can find someone willing to give you the fox news spin of a person enriching themselves by paying ot to state troopers to shut down roads so he can be at his own place of business. Be my guest.
Biden barely stepped foot in NJ, and sure as hell didn‚Äôt spend his weekends here golfing.

Trump is constantly here all summer golfing and spewing hate on his social media platform in between rounds.
Did you try thoughts and prayers as a solution?
Donald Trump is a cuck
Reddit is simply a liberal echo chamber. It does not represent the majority‚Äôs feelings & thoughts. 

Example: the 2024 election. If you only listened to Reddit, Trump would have lost. Obviously, that did not happen. 


It is frustrating. But you have to remember that
Whoa, whoa, whoa! There's no room here for people who want to start a constructive dialogue and won't just blindly call Trump and Elon nazis!
Idk which aircraft is airforce 1 since it's whatever aircraft he flys in at any given moment. And yes when that aircraft represents tax waste and traffic jams for the local population it's pretty much a negative thing in all regards.
*half of the voting population

Not that it matters.
Buddy, *everything* is politics.
Define half. Half the voting age population? No he 100% did not get half of the country to say yes we pick trump.

Instead only 1/3rd of the country voted and he got half of a 1/3rd which is only 1/6th of the country actually voting for him.
But what about that other guy!!!? But officer the other people on the highway were speeding too!!!
No, this is a regular occurrence and will be all summer due to him owning golf courses that will get to charge the government for their stays on it.
Funding public education vs golf junkets. I see how you might get confused.
Imagine thinking this comment was a dunk of a comment, when you're just trying to draw an equivalency between this pathetic sack of shit golfing and firing the scientists in charge of the nuclear arsenal and cancer research.

These aren't the same. I know you admitted you can't keep up but try to buddy - it's not that confusing once you break your cultlike delusion
What do you mean? Everyone cares.
The issue is who is deciding what constitutes ""wasted tax dollars.""
I'm only letting you know in the way I feel to let you know. You can take the information or not for all I care. But to ask me to neuter my comments while providing you information sounds like you have a soft spot for your beloved leader. Take it easy snowflake.
You mean Solberg in Readington?  I‚Äôve never been aware of him flying there.  Somerset Airport sees some side activity but nothing with him on board.   It‚Äôs Morristown only for ‚ÄúAir Force One‚Äù (ie the jet known colloquially as Air Force One) and then he transfers to a helicopter that goes to his golf course.
He normally flies to Morristown or Newark, Readington is too small for AF1.
When did Biden close rt 24?
 Secret Service
the united states secret service, not our new jersey state troopers.
One golf ball at a time!
Its hard to confirm numbers, but I was curious to see,  

In just 48 days, Trump's golf trips have already totalled $18 million, putting him on track to surpass the $151.5 million spent during his first term. 

Biden made 76 trips to Delaware.  It was estimated that each trip cost the taxpayer $200,000 with at least $11 million on flights alone.  So, the running total is somewhere north of $15 million.   Even if that is an underestimate, Mr. Trump still seems a bit more expensive.  

At least we aren't paying for the greens fees.
Fuck off bot.
This is really pathetic lol lick those boots harder buddy
[removed]
Luckily Biden didn't run for president. Unfortunately he probably had a better chance than a black woman for people like you.
Secret service. And state troopers. Figured you can put it together to save time.
Proof: see first term: same evil, very ineffective
I think that he is in serious mental decline at this point. His first term and the last few years he was constantly on the campaign trail putting himself in front of cameras and doing dumb shit. Now the only time he is in front of a camera he is surrounded by people like Musk, and Vance who jump in and interrupt him. Feels like they are trying to corral him to the right answers and they know him going out on his own with other world leaders could cost them dearly.
Trump doesn't know hard work nor intelligence :)
Yup, because we all know that Trump personally signed all 1500 pardons for the treasonous insurrectionists of January 6th.
‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs computer‚Äù says it all.
That‚Äôs an interesting take, that I have to agree with. Someone in Trump‚Äôs White House has definitely used the autopen without his supervision.
For Clinton does it count as a whole big Mac if he only takes a [bite of someone elses](https://youtu.be/eYt0khR_ej0?si=IZsDn4rq5FVAlm-v) else's while inside doing his rounds?
Do you think he actually hand signed every pardon of the 1/6 insurrectionists? That shit was autopened too. Which is a legal way for them to be signed.
I've long held that some animals can sense evil.
I had to wait for Obama‚Äôs motorcade once. It was like 20ish minutes since they weren‚Äôt exactly sure on timing. The second he was past the side street I was on, we were on our way. 

A few years prior to that, I pulled out of the driveway for work early one morning (still dark) and there was a dark car with tinted windows at the bottom of my driveway. My drive drive my street showed many more of these cars and then a house with many men in suites chatting outside. Got to work and learned Obama was visiting a home on my street later that day. I lived like 20 houses away and had no clue because of how little interruption it caused. Obviously during the visit the street was closed but I‚Äôm sure the residents in that block had warning.
I recall being stuck on 78 leaving the airport because Clinton arrived from NYC between the time I got in my car and the time I made it around to 78.  At least an hour waiting for him to get airborne.
My sister graduated that year. We were in line to get in the stadium when the helicopter arrived. Super cool to see

It's also surprising that mudders with 4x4s haven't torn any of his golf courses up.
Yeah - short term pain for long term improvements. Just like Trump and Elon say right? They can contemplate how they still have jobs while tens of thousands of people are being fired without valid reasons.
You really don‚Äôt understand civil disobedience or protest at all do you?
I work over there and I‚Äôll just say me and the guys grab a hefty amount of donuts in the morning so idk about this rumor..

What truly amazes me is how anyone in this state can vote R after the pandemic alone when the GOP was threatening to cut off aid to our state that we were entitled to. When states like California, New York, New Jersey need aid, it's a ""bailout"" while our states keep shit hole states like Louisiana and Kentucky from crumbling into the ground with what we contribute to the federal pot. 

It never ceases to amaze me how many idiots vote against their best interests.
And there you go, you just proved their point. This post had nothing but positive vibes and constructive talk but the first thing you do is call him an idiot and tell him to GFY. Please take a minute today and try to do better.

Imagine going on the internet to type out this comment, feeling good about it, and hitting send
What are other social media networks?
I wonder what the average Reddit age demographic is? 

I looked it up.

**Age Distribution:**

18-24: 30.6%¬†

25-34: 32%¬†

35-44: 16.4%¬†

45-54: 10.5%¬†

55-64: 6.4%¬†

65+: 4.1%¬†

  
Young, idealistic, and wanting everyone else to listen to (and fall in line with) their lack of true wisdom (which comes with age).  I know because in the early 1990s I was the same way.
> Trump and Elon nazis

I think we can call a spade a spade.
It‚Äôs not blind when there‚Äôs tons of photos and videos out there about it. Remember his little AfD speech? What non Nazis would voluntarily speak at a nazi rally?
They‚Äôre fascist scumbags so there‚Äôs that.
You would have to be blind not to see what's going on as authoritarianism.
Well, if the shoe fits
He didn't even get that. It's less since only 1/3rd of the country actually voted.
Maybe that would apply if you were actually somebody but nobody will ever see these comments and everyone is entitled to their opinion so just thought I should throw that in there
Hahaha someone‚Äôs angry :( awhhhh
He can't read, poor boy
Lol, you‚Äôre just continuing to prove my point on how obsessed you are by jumping straight into the assumption that I even support the dude.
My BIL's parents live right behind it and they've had times where their Dish cuts out. That's how they know that he's landing there. It happened often during the first four years and yes Solberg, I couldn't remember the name.
So he flies in one of the smaller planes when going to NJ?
Both SS and state troopers are heavily paid to carry out the closing and operations of moving him to his palace in NJ.

That definitely sounds like something a bot would say....
Then you know he can't and won't see your mildly terrifying and depressing comment lapping on praise, yeah?
First of all she is not a black woman, her ancestors were mostly from India. People like me! Who is the racist here?!
He sure does feel like he's everything everyone said Biden was, in that regard...
The media was rushed out of the Kennedy Center when Trump went on a Tariff tangent out of nowhere so yeah, he's losing it.
It‚Äôs the ozempic (in addition to old age). It dehydrates you like a motherfuck and you know this shithead is not drinking water with his McDonald‚Äôs living ass. Dehydration leads to cognitive decline. There‚Äôs not a long way to ‚Äòdecline‚Äô (he‚Äôs already about rock bottom) to but the bitch can barely form a sentence now.
I feel this way too. Just look at his 2016 speaches vs the ones today.
Of course. I just imagine he look at the two or three pictures they put on top of each EO, then gives it the auto pen approval
I mean it‚Äôs not that funny, regardless of your feelings. If he was killed it would have thrown the country and world in utter, destructive chaos.
You‚Äôre not getting people on your side by disrupting their day. I don‚Äôt know how this hasn‚Äôt been learned yet. People are swayed by what they perceive as ‚Äúlogic and reasoning‚Äù in 2025, not disruptive protests that affect the common people more than the ones its intended to disrupt. So‚Ä¶ have fun! Hopefully it is a lot of fun because it sure as hell won‚Äôt be affective.

Edit: added to logic and reasoning phrase for clarification as stated in comments below
Don‚Äôt care. People are exhausted, just want to get home and you want to be a POS and clog up the highways so you can stand out there with your signs and accomplish nothing
They have a case at the end of the aisle, so I‚Äôm told.
lol, [Entenmann's](https://www.entenmanns.com/)!

be sure your own spelling is correct if you rank on others
One was clearly staged. The second one could barely be called an attempt
> What truly amazes me is how anyone in this state can vote R after the pandemic alone when the GOP was threatening to cut off aid to our state that we were entitled to.

No one in this state should have ever voted republican again after republicans wanted to withhold aid after Sandy.
Why can't a felon vote but can become a president?
The modern republican party and it's voters don't deserve my compassion when they don't want to provide that same compassion to others.  So again, writing is on the wall.  Trump voters are ignorant and extremely short sighted and it's put our entire world standing at risk once again.
Um, pardon me, but his whining and demanding that everyone cater to his personal preferences were not ‚Äúpositive vibes and constructive talk.‚Äù So the post was clearly not ‚Äúall positive vibes and constructive talk‚Äù up until the moment someone responded to him. If you want to pitch a fit about the post not being ‚Äúpositive vibes and constructive talk,‚Äù why don‚Äôt you point the finger at the one going ‚Äúwaahhhhhhh I don‚Äôt wanna reaaaaaaad this, I‚Äôm speeeeeeecial cater to meeeeeeeee‚Äù?
You seemingly have no problem with Fuck Biden flags all over the place but now you ask for decorum? You have a retard filled safe space called /r/conservative I suggest you head there.

Your president sucks. GFY
They really haven't learned.  Name calling anyone who didn't agree with all of the left's ideas went so well in the 2024 election so let's double down on it!
Thank you, i was about to say the same thing to a bunch of replies to the above comment. They're just making themselves look more hateful and angry when the oringinal comment was about community and things we have in common.

Edit: a word
No one cares about what you do on Reddit. The point of THIS POST is that Trump is horrible for the country. This is AMERICA and we can post what we want. If you don‚Äôt like it, you don‚Äôt have to follow. If you don‚Äôt want to get attacked for supporting a fascist then keep quiet.
Feel free to start a NoTrumpTalkNJ subreddit. These are user run subreddits so instead of complaining, you could try to create a community with rules that you like.
Took one whole second lol
Twi‚Ä¶ I mean X.  But if you go there, you‚Äôre probably a Nazi. According to *them*
It‚Äôs not blindness. It‚Äôs consent. And that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre scumbags.
In this case, ‚Äúvoting population‚Äù literally means the population that voted
Not that I was aware of.
yes whatever plane the president is on is AF 1 . The iconic one is a 747 but they also use a converted 757 I believe
true true, the blue likely loves working tirelessly for papi trumpo.
Pretty sure his entourage is charged for whatever they do there - carts, lodging, food.
He has to be. You cant possibly be that negative in real life, like theres absolutely nothing they post that gets upvoted? Even in their mango mussolini subs?
Every accusation is a confession
They are and they do everything the accuse others of. Great textbook projection.
I was just thinking the same.
My wife's old boss went from one of the best researchers in his field to dying within 3 years because of early onset dementia. Maybe we'll all get lucky and he'll bottom out at hyper speed.
I think it would kick off a massive nationwide party...
Yeah the parades would be pretty chaotic
Unlike the peace and serenity we're enjoying now, obviously.
If he was killed, everything would have been great now.
I can totally see what you're saying about disruption not resulting in positive outcomes or changing of minds...

But saying ""people are swayed by logic and reasoning in 2025"" is the most insane nuclear take, load of bullshit I've ever heard lol.

Those are the two things we are lacking most direly worldwide, somehow even having eggs and competency in the federal government beat.
Right.  Big trucks parades on the with MAGA flags causing traffic to slow down on the parkway/turnpike are fine but don't work the other way.  Harassing people in Target and destroying property there is fine but don't do it to Tesla.  Totally didn't help Trump. Didn't rally his base at all.  Stay home and be quite cuz it won't work...hahahaaha.
If people were swayed by logic and reasoning we wouldn't be in the midst of the dumbest fucking administration to ever inhabit our government
> You‚Äôre not getting people on your side by disrupting their day. 

He's disrupting people's day by crashing the economy (causing them to lose those jobs they are trying to get to) and then creating grid lock to play golf instead of actually making a half assed attempt to give the image of him actually trying to make things ""better"".

Instead he's pushin Teslas on the White House lawn owned by a South African Nazi.
>People are swayed by logic and reasoning in 2025

No they absolutely are not lmao
> People are swayed by logic and reasoning in 2025

What people? There's an entire faction who literally don't believe in actual logic and reasoning. Not sure if you noticed, but they're in charge.
Disruption seems to have gotten people on Trump‚Äôs
Side. You should study civil disobedience and look into how civil rights peaceful protests worked. Making people uncomfortable has been a tactic used for centuries.
Someone needs to tell the French this then.
The POS is the dude golfing. I don‚Äôt want to stand with any signs. Again - you don‚Äôt get it.
But no castle at Windsor
Oops..you dropped your tin foil hat
Not to mention the SALT cap which specifically targeted states like New Jersey. Trump took thousands of dollars out of my family's pocket. Fuck him and fuck his bootlicking, shitsipping supporters
Yup - even better example.
Fighting fire with fire will just lead to more fires. Having intelligent conversations will go much further in life than name calling. Hopefully you're able to realize that sooner than later.
Haha alright cool thanks for the directions but I don't need them. I don't blindly follow the red just as others shouldn't for the blue. I never brought up politics and supporting Trump, I could care less about that or him. It's just about being a decent human being.
Exactly true
>when the oringinal comment was about community and things we have in common.

Ya think?

>I don‚Äôt recall any republican hate towards Biden on this subreddit when we could have easily flooded it endless content‚Ä¶.
[deleted]
you mean the one where a large portion of the user base is bots?
Well here's a truth. That network uses its algorithm to amplify pro-Trump/Musk and conservative content across its user's screens. Does that make it a conservative echo chamber? Like, it is programmed to elevate that content above all else, no matter what.

I deleted mine prior to the election because it was apparent what was happening. I only ever used my account to follow local sports news, yet every time I opened the app, I was peppered with pro-Trump or conservative propaganda, despite disabling all targeted ads and preferences in account settings for anything beyond sports news. I kept getting it anyway.

It also subjectively bans accounts critical of Trump/Musk, for example a ""WhiteDudesforHarris"" account the same day it was created. Why would the platform do that? What rules did they break if they didn't even get to post anything?

I'm sorry that you may not realize most social media networks are echo chambers, but many are by design. Others, like Reddit, have actual people disagreeing with your opinion, but at least it's not just the platform program itself.
I don't think the large ""iconic"" AF1 (the VC-25, ""747"") can land in Morristown in normal operations.  In an emergency I think it could utilize a runway that length, but normal operations it would ideally land in Newark (and I think it has in the past).  

Finding vids online of AF1 at Morristown, looks like it's the smaller C-32 ""757"" aircraft.  Either for convenience or to not adversely affect Newark operations since it's such a high-traffic airport.
Don't be so sure. When the Rwandan president's plane went down the genocide started. So it's hardly something to cheer for. His supporters would lose their minds.
I don't think it would be what you want it to be lol
It'd be Munchkinland after Dorothy's house landed, but even happier
![gif](giphy|8lgqAbycBjosxjfi9k|downsized)
It make now look like picnic
Don't worry these are the same folks screaming that normal methods don't work and that we need to think outside of the playbook. As long as that outside thinking doesn't disrupt their day. üòÇ
The egg narrative is beyond dead my guy. Egg prices are way down. Even CNN is reporting on it (of course sandwiched in a headline about how Trump deserves no credit for it, though they were happy to blame him when they were skyrocketing)
It was lame as hell when they did it and lost them a ton of support until democrats shot themselves in the foot time and time again leading up to november 2024
[removed]
So let people hate him for that? If the wallet is a major concern among americans (which it should be), and they feel trump is doing a bad job on that front, republicans will not win in 2028. Until then, you can cope, protest, whatever. Even if something happens to Trump you just get Vance. So‚Ä¶ seeya at the polls in 2028!
People will go to the side where they feel smarter. If people feel smarter on the left, they go to the left. If they feel smarter on the right, they go to the right. Everyone thinks they are logical and reasonable, and that the other side is cancerous and idiotic. This strategy does not empower the average voter to feel like the left is smarter.
Ok then, what they *perceive* as logic and reason. And the idea of disrupting thousands of normal civilians‚Äô days in a protest and expecting them to be on your side isn‚Äôt logical or reasonable even to the most worm-ridden brains around, especially when it comes to Jersey folk and their commutes. Good luck
Trump is the least popular president in 80 years. MLK was arrested for protesting and blocking the street aka 'parading without permit'. I don't think they studied protest history if you think the left has 'gone too far' on anything. Especially when the other side is fascist.
No you just want to grind major highways to a complete stop on a fucking Friday. There‚Äôs more than one POS here and you fall into that category if that‚Äôs your plan. Signs or no signs.
Republicans are resistant to intelligent conversation because all of the facts of the last 30+ years prove democrats right. Because feels > facts for republicans these days.
When has NJ ever been nice to assholes? Are you new to the state?
Because this sub works just fine.
Because there's no merit in catering to snowflakes like yourself
There sure seem to be a lot of people engaging with this post. It almost seems like people in this sub are interested in this content and you‚Äôre just throwing a tantrum because everyone isn‚Äôt catering to your personal preferences. 

You are free to not click on posts that mention Trump. You are not free to demand that everyone else stop talking about a topic that DOES IMPACT US because you don‚Äôt feel like it.

You are not more special than the rest of us. The internet does not cater to your personal tastes.
I don't give a shit about eggs one way or another. It was the conservative go-to when shrieking about Biden. It was a dead horse before the election, you don't have to tell me twice.
>(of course sandwiched in a headline about how Trump deserves no credit for it, though they were happy to blame him when they were skyrocketing)

Sucks when the other side uses your own stupid bullshit against you, doesn't it?

Funny how nothing bad is ever Trump's fault, but every time some smooth-brain stubbed his toe during the Biden years, it was somehow always because of Sleepy Joe.
LMAO, okay, do walk me through the steps here. Take me through the mind of a ""conservative"" who dropped support for Trump because of an obnoxious redneck motorcade, then crawled back to him because of whatever the Democrats did. Please. I'm so looking forward to reading this.
Trump got marginally more support than he did in 2016. Undecided voters? No man - they were decided they just didn‚Äôt want to say it. 

Your take is absurd. But it is funny so keep it up.
He won when running against a black woman. People just hate blacks and women more than senile  racists. America let the world know that brown and female are things that they can't get over.
Reality doesn‚Äôt sway his voting base. Otherwise, they ALREADY wouldn‚Äôt be voting for him. They think they care about their wallets, but they‚Äôll just believe him if he says they have more money.
Yep, dislike that comment! Doesn‚Äôt change anything at all!
bold of you to assume we'll have elections in 2028, let alone 2026 midterms.
‚Äúeverything i think and feel is also thought and felt by everyone else‚Äù

no, bro
Awww. Sorry if you must be inconvenienced. Man - Americans are so weak. They‚Äôll tolerate anything as long as it doesn‚Äôt interfere with their commute.
Ok, I can see you're not going to get it. Hope you have a great day
Nope, lived here forever. Probably longer than you have actually
Plus people can choose not to read a message within a subreddit. It wasn't like the title was deceiving.
Not true at all. It was a huge talking point up until this past week and still is for a lot of reddit.
No no I actually agree he did not deserve credit for this at all‚Ä¶. but he also didn‚Äôt deserve the hate when they were way up. It was the biden admin who (as is the rightful protocol) killed a bunch of chickens to stop the spread of avian flu. It‚Äôs a case of ‚Äúnobody is wrong and it‚Äôll go back to normal soon‚Äù

However, since the media gave trump such a hard time with the egg prices, he can now use it as another victory to make himself look good. Quite a self own with no foresight tbh.
Things that happened between 2021 and 2024 to push people back towards trump (in no order):

1. Decreased purchasing power of wages
2. Increase in energy and food prices
3. Botched pullout of Afghanistan and the reaction from both Trump and Biden camps
4. Unfiltered borders resulting in documented and widely broadcasted property, gang and violent crime
5. Calling everyone a bigot who disagrees with you alienates anyone who slightly disagrees with you. That‚Äôs in insane sentiment and those people aren‚Äôt coming back.
6. Running a candidate with no charisma or memorability and calling racism or misogyny when people aren‚Äôt feeling her. Meanwhile she got cooked in 2020 by Tulsi and never recovered.
7. Missing the ball on covid. Lab leak was real and people were kicked off of social media for even suggesting it in 2021. We can call that one a draw with the amount of insane anti vaxxers.

I could go on and on but I‚Äôll save my fingers
What happened to the voters that beat trump in 2020 then? Why did they stay home? It‚Äôs equally about those people
You‚Äôre setting yourself up for literally the most ironic moment of all time if Tulsi runs as a republican. So proceed with that sentiment with caution but just know it‚Äôs not the case at all and some day you might have to decide between voting republican or being the one who is voting against the woman of color.
What about moderates and undecided voters?
Wager?
Correct. That is not the case. But each side thinks this way
lol you must not have an actual job where you have to commute. Makes sense since you have so much free time to make up signs and march around the block all day. And I don‚Äôt have to tolerate anything so yea, don‚Äôt fuck with my commute.
It's really exhausting being constantly told to take the high road against people who comfortably lounge in swamp levels of kindness.
I hope you have the day you deserve
I promise you it's for the same reason I'm referencing. 

If ""conservatives"" used it as a blight on Biden, and Trump promised to fix it on day one, people rightfully tried to highlight how nonsensical, petty, and just plain stupid the whole thing was from the get-go, when prices weren't fixed *on day one*. That's why it's still a phrase, however silly. 

At the bottom of it: none of the message will get through at all. It's the same, short-sighted dumbassery that led to those ""I Did That!"" stickers. People just waste their time (myself included) trying to be clever, unable to understand that ""conservatives"" are incapable of shame or introspection, so the hypocrisy doesn't affect them in the least. It's a losing game.

EDIT: alllllll of this to say, yes, I agree with the edit to your OP LOL
Yes a lot of people seemed to have stayed home or voted for other races and skipped President. But that doesn‚Äôt change that Trump did not receive ‚Äòa huge amount of support from undecided voters because he called out and harped on every single logical fallacy, misstep and hypocrisy for the last 4 years‚Äô. 

There‚Äôs nothing that supports that claim except your personal feelings.
That might be the only chance Democrats have to win. Unfortunately this country is so backwards and racist they even voted to hopefully turn back time!!
Most of them don‚Äôt pay enough attention or dig deep enough to know the difference between pure rhetoric and fact. Harris‚Äô policies won out in blind polls among most voters. And yet here we are.
the only sure things in life are death and taxes and for some people that second one is up for review.
nope, buddy, that‚Äôs just empty-headed nonsense
Continue with your assumptions. I drive 25,000-30,000 miles per year easily. And yeah I have a job. You‚Äôre very irritable though.
Then the same could be said for why democrats lost support at a federal level leading to their dogshit approval rating at this moment in time
Tulsi would be an absolute nightmare for democrats if she won a nomination. Anti-war Veteran woman of color, stoic and calm voice and an excellent speaker, former democrat alienated by the party. She has absolutely torched any democrat she‚Äôs come into contact with in a debate. Plus it puts democrats in that aforementioned position of voting against the woman of color or voting republican. That is not a winnable election for dems. They should have latched onto her in 2020 and never let go after that debate that ended Kamala‚Äôs campaign.

Vance is the best chance the dems have. He reads more like another face in the crowd who will just try to coast on any successes trump has.
What poll and what policies?
Do you not see the irony in your dismissiveness of my sentiment? You‚Äôre right about what you believe in and everyone who disagrees is stupid or misguided, right?
Na not irritable. Just think you‚Äôre as much of a POS as the person you‚Äôre protesting if you think clogging up the roads with you and your signs is ok
No the same cannot be said. You can‚Äôt just make something up that you can‚Äôt even remotely support and state it as a fact.
Dems will just tank on purpose to collect more fear money.  This country is just full of maga so time to let it rot and say goodbye. No reason to even pay attention anymore. They made it clear that America is not safe for brown or black or poor. Let the maga have this dump they want to live in!  Time to leave!

There is no good candidate for people who actually care about anyone else. Get your money fast and get out!!
https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50802-harris-vs-trump-on-the-issues-whose-policies-do-voters-prefer
no, doofus
I‚Äôm as much of a POS as the person who‚Äôs indiscriminately firing people and destroying government institutions? You‚Äôre funny and irritable.
Then why did those people stay home or actively vote in other races but not for harris?
Weak reply
If you‚Äôre grinding the highways to a halt at the end of a workday/week, yea. Read above - there can be more than one POS in this scenario. It‚Äôs not a tough concept to grasp
That‚Äôs how you get the most attention to something.
Cool story. Keep being a POS then"
Middletown Roller Rink,"Attention Monmouth county Hockey community- 
The roller rink in middletown is set to be renovated soon given a sign was just out in the park. I have established a community chat to allow the hockey community to come together with a future goal to start a outdoor roller league.

Advice for first time traffic court in VA. (I have a NJ probationary auto license),"Hello all. This past Saturday I was pulled over in Chesapeake VA. I was on my way to the park with my two kid, and I was about to just get to the park when I got pulled over. There is a sign that says ‚Äúleft turn yield on green‚Äù. I did yield when I turn left but I guess I calculated the distance from the car on the opposite side of the road because the car ahead of me was about to hit my butt right side the car. I couldn‚Äôt speed up due to cars being ahead of me too. I saw that the car was following me and then I saw the car turn on its light. That‚Äôs when i realized that it was a cop. I pulled over to a parking lot and rolled down my window, mind you I‚Äôm nervous since this was my first time being pulled over. The cop comes over and begins yelling at me. He says to me ‚Äúdo you know what you‚Äôre doing? Do you have any clue what you did? Do you know how to drive?‚Äù I reply politely and tell him that i didn‚Äôt know what i did wrong. And explained to him that the light was green on my side and I yielded. He then asks for my drivers license and registration and he takes a look at my license and it‚Äôs a NJ probationary auto license. I‚Äôve been waiting to finish school to fully change my license to here. I‚Äôve been going back and forth between states since September. I just finished school in February and i was going to change my license soon. But he asked me since when I have been living here and since I was so nervous I told him I had been living here since September. He turns around to his car and comes back with two tickets, one is ‚Äúfailing 2 yield oncoming mv‚Äù and the second one is ‚Äúdriving w out a license‚Äù. He explained to me that he couldn‚Äôt look me up in the system. That there was no record of me having a license. I told him that the card I gave him is my license. And points to my license and says ‚ÄúI have no idea what a probationary auto license is‚Äù you‚Äôre going to have to go to court to prove you have a license. My court date is in May and my question is that if I can dispute both tickets. From my research it‚Äôll be easy to prove that I have license. I‚Äôll be going to the dmv this week to change my license and I also have paid the NJ DMV for my driving record and it‚Äôs clean. I really don‚Äôt have the money to pay for a lawyer.

There would have been a gap between you and cars in front of you if had yielded. It sounds like you and your fianc√© need to some driving instruction. Also to change your licenses over because you are making us look bad.
I made an illegal left turn in Philly (straight up not paying attention) and joked to the cop ""I don't know what I was thinking. I'm from Jersey, we're not even allowed to turn left there!"" and he let me off with a warning lmfaooo so that might just work.
NC too, I started speeding after I got out of VA and got hit with a $300 ticket that I could only mail a money order for and my license was suspended in NC for a month and I have to pay $100 to reinstate it.  Haven‚Äôt done that yet, considering just never going there again.
I have 60 days to change it, I wasn‚Äôt able to change my  license until I am fully moved here. I took driving lessons, and have a clean record. Unlike my finance, he is a horrible driver and has no driver license whatsoever. I try to drive the best I can to avoid being like him‚Ä¶"
ISO Guitar Player for my Band (established Independent Musician),"(Mods, hope this is allowed, if not I won't be offended if it gets taken down)

Hi all.  I am located in Whippany.  My second record is being released in August and I need a rhythm guitar player for my band who is comfortable playing acoustic and electric. I am an independent musician supported by a PR agent in NYC who works primarily with independent musicians and my first single from the record is being released next month so there is a lot of creative momentum here already.

My music is a fusion of high-energy guitar-driven power pop and deeply personal storytelling. (I like to think of it as rooted in 90s era post-grunge sound with the aim of capturing the emotional sincerity of someone like Bruce Springsteen #bruuuuuuce or Peter Gabriel.)

My band members are spread between Beacon and Newburgh NY, Brooklyn, and Whippany New Jersey and we would most likely be rehearsing in some combination of NJ, Beacon and Brooklyn. We are a very chill group of people and I can definitely promise a fun time working with us. We have an album release show planned for September, and more gigs tentatively on the dock this fall in the Hudson Valley, NYC, and New Jersey - a lot of potential here! I need to get us all together sooner rather than later to start rehearsing.

I‚Äôve created a public Facebook group to discuss the serious structural concerns at Avalon Wharton, including cracks in the walls, floor separation, and two sinkholes dangerously close to the building.

Doctor recommendations in new jersey?,"Hi everybody, I am posting this in r/newjersey and r/chronicillness for transparency. I‚Äôm 25F and looking for a primary caregiver in union/ middlesex/ essex county, new jersey. I went to a doctor today, but the doctor dismissed my two main concerns ( sleep and my hands + fingers hurting) and blamed it on my weight (160)‚Ä¶ even though I‚Äôve been having these hand issues for like 7 years, and sleep issues for longer. My dad has diagnosed sleep apnea and my mom has diagnosed insomnia. Additionally, the doctor also said I could not have sciatica or nerve pain even though I literally went to physical therapy for it for half a year. I was on an antipsychotic for sleep, but didn‚Äôt personally want to take another additional mental health med. My psychiatrist after the doctor‚Äôs appointment today told me to try CBT-I, and take magnesium. However, my hands, elbows, and knees hurt as I‚Äôm typing this. It‚Äôs not arthritis and it‚Äôs not carpel tunnel. Advil does not work. Preferably I‚Äôd like a doctor who understands chronic illness/ conditions and won‚Äôt blame everything on weight/ has a body positive mindset because I hate being shamed and I have had some of my health issues for a long term like since 15 years old and weighed ~100 pounds ( mainly I have IC/ PBS and chronic lyme). Any help is appreciated! Sorry for the information dump on my health üòì",0.67,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jeo7yt/doctor_recommendations_in_new_jersey/,4,1jeo7yt,2025-03-19 03:41,"This won't necessarily help, but it might be related. I was having sleep issues. Went to my dr, they sent me to a sleep specialist. Did that sleep study, determined I had sleep apnea. Got me some $600 machine, plus special training, all in all about $10,000 in expenses to set me up. The machine never worked for me, I would always end up waking up with a super dry mouth and air being blown through it. I stopped using it. Then, unrelated, I lost 20 pounds, my sleep apnea went away. Best sleep of my life. I asked my dr about it, and she said ""yeah, that is common."" When I asked her why she didn't just tell me to lose 20 pounds, she said ""No one listens when we say that anyway.""

I don't know if I would have listened, but I would like to think I would. None of us wants to hear what our drs say but a good dr should inform you of the truth. It isn't shaming if they are giving us actual sound advice that will address many of our problems, even if we don't follow it. I know someone else who takes testosterone shots, and gets into fights all the time. Any dr I talk to about it says the first thing they would do is stop the testosterone for a few weeks, see if the fights stop. Guess who still takes testosterone shots and still gets into fights all the time?
I recommend Dr. Jayakumar at Atlantic Health, who works out of a few locations, including one in Summit, which is Union County. She's a sleep doctor and I was prescribed a CPAP, it was life changing. I feel so much more rested than I have in nearly 10 years. As for other types of drs, I have no recommendations and can only offer commiseration.
Thanks for your response. If I had to loose weight to overcome my sleep issues, I would be like less than 80 pounds, since I was less than 90 when I couldn‚Äôt stay asleep and couldn‚Äôt fall asleep around age 14. I don‚Äôt think thats healthy for me personally to lose that much weight, but I am glad to hear that it worked out for you.
Thank you so much !! üòä"
Update 2: Where can I find rare and Unique Heinz Sauce Packets in NJ?,"Hi again! 

For anyone new,  I recently just started this new collection of trying to collect every Heinz Sauce Packet. I‚Äôm trying to find the more rare and unique ones such as Strawberry( this is next on my list!) Honey Mustard, brand name packets, Hot Taco, Salad Dressing! ( those are just the first few that I‚Äôm looking to get they have so many more that I can‚Äôt even list) This is just another update post from my previous one and I recently just found some Mostaza (Spanish Mustard), BK St. Patrick's Green Ketchup!, Salsa Del Sol, and Grey Poupon! (both Heinz) I've been looking all over NJ and I feel like my luck is running out but I am still getting some spots around that have had some random ones! I‚Äôve checked places such as gas stations, grocery store delis, rest stops, Wawa‚Äôs, targets, 7/11s and more. I‚Äôm looking into heading into other states such as PA or NY to see if they have any variation out there so if you know any places please feel free to share no matter the distance. I said in my other post  I would be heading to the Heinz History Museum but I wasn't able to for various reasons, but I did make a trip to Texas and found some Miracle Whip Packets! Does any one know where I can find some other packets that I don‚Äôt have at specific locations?? I am still posting on TikTok documenting my journey on finding all of Heinz‚Äôs packets!

The Embassy Suites in Berkeley Heights has Heinz jelly dippy cups in mixed fruit and I think apple at their breakfast buffet!

Are you saucetistic? Neat collection.
This is cool as hell. You've opened my eyes to a world I didn't even realize existed.
The Pie Shop in Montclair has the British Heinz products. Idk about packets tho
I work with a prepared foods manufacturer. I'm 90% sure they have a contract (or at least a good relationship) with Heinz. Got a list of what's missing?
Are you on tiktok? I saw a guy with a similar collection and thought he might be you
A kitchen remodel. There‚Äôs always a random pack that fell behind a cabinet from 30 years before.
Nice work, Sauce Boss‚Ñ¢. I see a familiar packet on image 4 :)
I couldn't tell you where to get more but I can tell you that I think this collection is both weird and cool
Not in NJ, but the Gaylord National Hotel in National Harbor, MD has large Heinz salsa packets. I‚Äôve never seen them anywhere else.
Wow, at first I rolled my eyes thinking it was mostly basic packets but I am impressed - you have some deep cuts! Never heard of taco sauce, horseradish, st paddy‚Äôs sauce, or jalape√±o! I actually went to Scotland last year and they had a ton of other weird ones you don‚Äôt have. Not saying to cheat and buy them from eBay, but here is a list of what I used near daily: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/175357791787. The salad cream would be a great addition. I‚Äôm thinking maybe do some research on English/irish/Scottish pubs near you? The more authentic the better. Can just grab a pint and take a look at their packets and move on. Not a bad adventure lol
So cool! I assume you‚Äôve already posted in r/coolcollections?
I love when people use their free will for shit like this‚Ä¶ good luck finding more!!!
I wonder what the power 9 equivalent would be for this collection...
Now that that homeless guy is back on his feet I guess you're our new obsession
Very impressive, and beautifully organized. To 57 and beyond!
Per the Google you can get the strawberry in a 200 count pack. You might hit up the hotels/motels for breakfast. Or visit the Heinz musuem in Pittsburgh.
Yes!!!
Said it before and I‚Äôll say it again,
Thank you for sharing and please keep em coming,

I hope one day I encounter a sauce that helps you
This is an interesting collection- I respect the dedication and organization
We love the sauce man üôåüèº

You have the dip or squeeze! My favorite form, are they still around? I feel like I saw those from Wendy's ten years ago and then never again.
this is awesome lol
Chopped Onion was a surprising one. What is the texture of the sauce like?
This is amazing. Now I'm going to be looking every time I go somewhere and will hit you up if see anything.
Heinz does have a NJ ketchup packet that has a pork roll sandwich (I cannot believe I called it that, Taylor Ham forever) on it. Don‚Äôt know where to get it tho. I‚Äôm in north jersey if that helps. I would try some

Dude! This was exactly the post I needed to see this morning. You are awesome Richie sauce binder is the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
I hope nobody sits on that binder.
I've been keeping an eye out for you!
As a sauce lover and New Jerseyan, this is dope. Google says Heinz has a couple Jersey office locations in East Hanover, Fair Lawn, and Parsippany-Troy Hills. Maybe give them a call or try paying a visit and tell them about it and they might feel charitable and hook you up? (edit: the information may be out of date some of those may be closed)
Maybe try some spots down in south Jersey/atlantic city area. Cool collection!
If you haven‚Äôt tried one already, I‚Äôd recommend stopping by a good NJ diner to see what they have! Some diners will have bottles of the more common condiments, but most should have at least a couple packets and things!
Out of curiosity, do you get 2 packets so you can at least try them?
Strawberry jelly?  Chick fil a
I find this absolutely perplexing but god speed to you sir. I hope you find whatever it is you're missing.
Don‚Äôt accidentally sit on that binder. Or you will create a completely new and unheard of sauce.
That square one makes me uncomfortable¬†
This is amazing
Last time you posted I told you I found an unusual one at the Amazon store in Eatontown but I went back and all I could find was bbq and I forgot to let you know.

Edit: I did find Heinz sauce packet cat toys at the Dollar Tree about a month ago.

I wonder if you can find out from Heinz how many different things they offer? Then at least you will know how close your collection is to being complete.
just when I thought it couldnt get any weirder...

but you know what hell yeah, this is dope af...keep it going dawg

Pizza Love in Wyckoff (Bergen County) has stuff that aren‚Äôt technically sauce packets, but are packets of oregano, red pepper flakes, and something else that I can‚Äôt remember. Not sure if that‚Äôs what you are looking for, but regardless!
Imagine bustin out the 1974 Limited Edition Heinz ketchup for a special occasion. Prob hits different.
Not sure if it fits , but you should be able to get True Citrus packets from Amazon for fairly cheap. I don't know how common they are but I haven't seen them very often in the wild. I use them all the time when cooking to balance flavors and add some zing.

Edit: Yeah, these are definitely not right for this collection, but I'll leave the post as it was. My bad.
That‚Äôs actually impressive
Are those Heinz packets? Some of them don't look like Heinz. For example Sweet relish I've seen come in a green pack.. I saw two different green colored packets.
I don't consider some of your collection Heinz. Heinz no longer owns Portion Pac. So while you have a Sweet Relish with the Portion Pac graphics, the Heinz ones are green in color instead of white and have the Heinz logo.
Not sure if you‚Äôd be interested in it for your collection, but I have  a hellmans chili lime mayo packet made with Tajin. Just found it in my car from god knows where.
I just found Cocktail sauce!!!
Are you also in the DMC Facebook group, OP? I swear I've seen something like this there

Love that store.  I never have any reason to go in then end up spending 60 bucks and am happy with everything.
There‚Äôs also a British shop in haddonfield too along with the British chip shop. I think they only have the bottles.
I was thinking about this the other day and was certain some Heinz sales guy is going to stumble across this  project on the internet soon and just give the guy one of everything. Does that take the joy out of scrounging all over New Jersey to gather the collection yourself? Does it make the collector's dream come true? Does he end up on a Heinz ad blitz? I dunno, but I'm totally invested in this project and love all the updates.
I actually did make a massive spreadsheet of every single sauce packet and dip but I‚Äôm down to chat with people that are down to send some to me. I do personally feel like buying them kinda takes the fun out of it, but I may buy some in the future like discontinued ones or old ones tbh
I don‚Äôt think op wants to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù like that if I‚Äôm not mistaken

They are in the condiment section of the self-service bistro area.

Poooooo I‚Äôm looking for Heinz specifically sorryyy thanks for commenting though
Ok, I'll put these back.

So, my random tip is to ask people who work in offices to scour their lunchrooms.  That's many people concentrating there finds to one location. Then 1 person collecting the treasures.  
  
So, you're 1 person. You can reach maybe 10 interested people per post. (Multiple socials, not just reddit). And each person who scours and finds something from their company lunchroom has used the power of many people to find packets.  
  
Your power will grow exponentially. Nothing can stop the eventual collection of all available types.

I worked one yr at the courthouse in bridgeton. For lunch we'd drive the 15 min to a small restaurant in greenwich next to the post office, which was pretty good actually. They were basically the only structures in town. Some of the buildings were built in the 1700's which was interesting to see. I was told there was a lot of smuggling/bootlegging in the area back in the day. The local bar association also had an event at a restaurant in fortescue which is truly bizarre and isolated fishing village on stilts along the delaware bay. So unique to see something like it in jersey. the locals loved to talk about the excellent fishing/oysters down by the bay and how crazy the black flies get during the summer. Some old families down there have summer homes along the bay on stilts deep in the marsh along single lane dirt roads. Few people from that part of Cumberland or Salem venture far from their hometown. You're an hour from the shore proper and an hour plus from philly, but it feels like a million miles from anything by our tiny state's standards. Rlly anything south of Rt. 49 is just a wild no-mans land of farms, marsh and no cell service, but I enjoyed working with the families in this interesting part of the state, nothing rlly compares in jersey.
Oysters, racism, clay, old buildings and signs falling into the bay, townies, prison, opioids, trips to Applebees. I grew up in the corner where the tip of CMC meets the western side, little town called Belleplain. It‚Äôs wild driving through there, feels like the bayou.
Good quiet living is what goes on within that circle. Lots of nature and wide open space. It‚Äôs beautiful and safe here. BTW: I‚Äôm not illiterate, uneducated, small minded or racist and I did not vote for Trump.

Apart from horseshoe crabs, Sea Breeze was once a thriving 1800s beach town on the bay that‚Äôs mostly just a ghost town now. Between fires and massive storms, the whole town just washed up and no ones bothered to rebuild. It‚Äôs an eerie, yet serene place to explore and great for fishing, crabbing and oyster harvesting. The only real populated areas are places like Bridgeton to the north which is a just a depressed, drug infested town. Everything about that region is spooky and forgotten.
My man that's where all the major fishing of Delaware bay is done. PortNorris is around that area, and that's the deleware bay fishing hub. Some others have mentioned but there is farmland, small town beaches and old fishing towns all over. Salem nuclear plant (don't think it's in Salem, but it's around that area)
Small ,quiet and peaceful. One of my recent adventures to renew my DL , took me to this place from central nj.
I've always known this part of NJ as the ""Down Jersey"" section of the state.
From Pennsville to Port Norris... weird as fuck
When my iphone and many people‚Äôs phones got stolen at a club in Philadelphia, those phones ended up in Bridgeton, NJ at a trailer park. 

A whole business runs out of that trailer park AND eventually the phones end up back to their original birth place, Shandong, China. I was able to track every time my phone got turned on and I watched it sail away back to China.

In my experience, lot of farms. A lot of single lane open roads‚Ä¶ houses on the bay have beautiful views but it is Maga country down there. Saw 50-100 maga signs only 1 Kamala. Funny because didn‚Äôt Trump take contracts away for farmers, ffs. Republicans love voting again their own interests
*Illiterate eagles fan noises*
Plate tectonics makes the earth's crust move like a giant conveyer belt. That part is where fresh New Jersey rises up out of the Delaware bay mud. While it's still fertile down there we grow stuff in it, but as it slowly moves north we start building more and more houses and industry on it. The further north you go the more the weight of development pushes New Jersey down until it disappears under NYC and the Adirondacks to be crushed and recycled.

Motosports park in Millville, Cohanzick Zoo in Bridgeton, Turkey Point preserve near Downe, oysters, crabs, plenty of other nature preserves, Hancock's bridge, Parvin State Park & campground (nearby)

Absolutely, fucking, nothing.

Greenheads get bad, alot of farmland in some parts, Greenwichs marina has an old movie used prop that is supposed to be a ufo, and they have a nice little restaurant there too (which is where my first job was) that town was also the sight of a ""tea party"" (ala the Boston tea party). The swamps are cool sometimes but buy in large are run down. Some solid crabbing spots if you get up early enough, as well as Fortescue the deep south jersey girls ""special happy place"" (most guys from this area have probably been taken/have taken a girl there at least once) its a beach on the delaware bay that gets love because it's simply different than everything else around it, but is no where near as nice as the actual jersey shore towns.

When I say nothing, I mean that elementary schools have had to close because of how low the population is in these towns, there is not alot of money here and most kids and teens dream of the day they can leave.

An achievement that I can say I accomplished 

My parents are, however, very happy there and there are pockets of good and nice things in this area, even if I'm a little jaded with the way I speak of them.

Not much now, fishing and trapping and very little industry. Prior to the Atlantic City expressway being built and family roadtrips being a thing, tourists from PA would travel down the Delaware River by boat and stop at these shore towns along the way.
I once went there, a town called Down New Jersey. It was so far south, that Google maps put me in the water.
Ask Tweeter and the Monkey Man
My friend lived in Bridgeton for a year and these giant spiders got into her apartment, so‚Ä¶that I guess.
Absogoddamnlutely nothing. It's such a shame how we have this amazing port city in Philly up the river and Dover by the bay, yet South Jersey can't do shit because of the swamp. Could at least make a bridge from the tri-city area across the bay, *something* to kick off some sort of port commerce. There is absolutely no good reason South Jersey should be that far behind other than the swamp makes it hard to build.
It's worth noting that, for most of that stretch, the water all the way up to the shore line is in Delaware. Up river a bit, there are parts of the land that are technically Delaware, the biggest at Finn's Point, which looks like it's the westernmost part of NJ. The Delaware part of the land is all a nature preserve.
You can see the AJ Meerwald, an oyster schooner and NJ's tall ship, down in Bivalve. I don't think much else goes on in those parts.

I grew up outside of Bridgetown. Here is a video the city put out in 1937 to show the town and attract people to moving there when it. A fun little piece of history. I found a vhs of it in my buddy‚Äôs antique shop and managed to get it uploaded to YouTube years ago. Now Bridgetown is basically just a small city with a lot of crime.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, lol. Mostly farm towns. 
Actually like everywhere there's local things if you look for them. You could visit Freedom Farm which is a rescue and sanctuary for farm animals and you can visit on weekends usually. It's located in Lawrence/Cedarville. 
There's the NJ Motorsports Park. 
There's an aviation museum. 
Motorcycle clubs seem to love ignoring the 30 mph through towns as they get caught in the excitement of most roads being both scenic and 50 mph. So there's that if you're into touring. 
Lots of neat spots to stop and fish, someone is forever pulling over and throwing a line out. 
Speaking of which I see the same with kayakers. There's farmers markets and an Amish market. If you aren't super specific about what the something is, you'll always find something to do. It's quiet, it's pretty, and don't forget the bug repellent because if the flies don't get you, the mosquitos will.

Lots of low-lying rural areas and coastal marshlands. Probably a once-popular fishing trade that drove the growth of nearby towns like Salem, Bridgeton, and Millville. Not too much tourism; the ocean coast to the east (shore) is much more popular and easier for many people to get to.

Many townships in New Jersey share the same name, sometimes even with a boro, but across different counties. Usually, only one is colloquially known by its name; the others are colloquially known by either unincorporated communities within them or as outlying areas of neighboring towns. Did you know there are 5 Washington Townships in New Jersey, with the one in Warren County surrounding a borough also named Washington?

Also: nuclear power plant on the bay at Lower Alloway Township.

I often think about what two major cities down there would do to the character of the rest of the state.  

In that DC universe NYC and Philly are less of a big deal, transit routes are completely transformed, AC would be a completely different place, the entire southern half of Jersey would be way more urban, etc.

Is it the same on the other side of Delaware Bay? I know a New Jersey couple who fled to that area as a tax refuge.
I think it's my #1 fear genuinely I was running screaming and crying running on that mile stretch from Thompsons Beach to the car late summer. Then when I got to my car I was kicking it and running around it crying more because those fucks were all over it then I quickly unlocked and ran in and sprayed bug spray all over the interior
I was once on one of those bayshore beaches in the circle OP posted and had to flee to my car because of the flies. I will never forget this sight: as I drove away, I looked in the rear view mirror and I could see a cloud of flies CHASING MY CAR.

What is funny about those areas.. they are quite historic and were once very rich thanks to the Delaware Bay.

Greenwich is the site of a tea party, Beautiful little town.

There used to be a town called Caviar ust south of Greenwich, they caught so much Atlantic Sturgeon that they were exporting Caviar to Russia. They also caught so much Sturgeon that they barely have any that come back and breed to this day.

Just outside of that circle area is Port Norris, once one of the richest towns in NJ. They had more millionaires per square mile than any other area of NJ thanks to the Oyster Trade. At the time the US led the world in oyster production, with NJ leading the country and Port Norris leading NJ.

Dermo and MSX wiped out the Oyster Trade almost overnight in the late 50s.

me being a professional millbilly and working in bridgeton for a decade and going to those marshes just for fun, i must agree and say this is the most accurate comment lol
I mean, or is a fan‚Ä¶.
Some of these things are just not true. I am about 55 minutes from Philly and can be in Sea Isle in 45 minutes. We don‚Äôt think Fortescue is bizarre, it‚Äôs charming and some of the best striper fishing you will find anywhere. More people from Philly own summer homes here than locals. The restaurant in Fortescue is the Charlesworth and you would be hard pressed to find a better meal in most of South Jersey. Make reservations though, it‚Äôs often full. 
I live in Newport, which is part of Downe Twp. and just about always have great cell service and internet service too. You also say that most of us do not venture far from our hometown. I don‚Äôt believe that is true here more than in the general population. My family and I have been all over the world but not to Australia‚Ä¶ too much scary stuff there. If anyone living here wants or needs anything other than nature and a good quiet life then they have to leave the area. We are not all as backwards as many people think, yes I have a college degree and love learning but I also appreciate a beautiful, safe, affordable, friendly place to live. Can you tell that I love it here!

For some reason, Metropolis being in Delaware seems even funnier to me lol
And Philly is also in New Jersey apparently. Acceptable.
To me it looks closer to Millville but again that‚Äôs just me
I've never seen this specific map. I only saw one that had dots making the area, I thought it would have been closer to Camden.
That was fun.. thank you.
Yes but Gotham is purposefully placed in South Jersey to explain why it‚Äôs full of crime
I‚Äôm not doubting you necessarily, but I do need a clip of Batman saying wooder as evidence.
It's actually more based on ""boardwalk wars"" era Atlantic City and prohibition era Chicago. Metropolis is based on NYC (but is based in DE)
Gotham as a nickname for NYC goes at least as far back as Washington Irving. 

With that in mind in the beginning DC comic's Gotham was probably supposed to be NYC but over time DC decided almost all of its cities should be fictional even if they are inspired by real ones.
In Dark Knight, Palisades are mentioned
NYC exists in DC, so they have to throw Gotham and Metropolis somewhere else

Exactly that what i said! Just stay away from the bay side and it's not as bad
The trick is to douse your body in listerine to keep them at bay.
we called these horse flies when I was a kid.  They will track you and wait for you while you dive to avoid them when swimming in lakes or pools. relentless in pursuit of a meal
Oh, Sandy Hook and Brigantine are very bad, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But there are *clouds* of them on the bay marshes.
What is Dermo and MSX?  Google yielded nothing that seemed relevant.
Whatever happened to the resistent oysters they were going to release that had the MSX resistence of Asian varieties. Last I heard they were going to do crispr on Atlantic oysters to help boyster Chesapeake and Delaware populations. Haven't heard anything in years on it.

This is New Jersey, there's at least 2 of every town.
Yes the one down south is Fairfield Township, NJ, a district of Bridgeton, NJ. Just very rural farm town with one Sunoco and fields and woods.
I think it's actually 3 - theres one in Howell too
There is also Burlington coat factory, in Burlington township, in Burlington County.
Yeah Fairfield is also up here in Essex county, where my family has lived since before it even was Fairfield
There is also two Washington townships

Ohhh I should go back some time
Yep, in Lower Alloway Creek. The school mascot is also a muskrat.
My dad loves to tell the story of how mom took him to meet her parents over dinner, and my grandmother served muskrat. After he near vomited, grandmom made him a peanut butter sandwich.

According to Wikipedia:

The Cumberland County Courthouse in Bridgeton in 2006
Bridgeton has consistently had violent crime rates above the national average. It is among the highest in the state, along with Camden, Atlantic City, Newark, and Trenton. In 2015, NeighborhoodScout, a real estate analytics firm, ranked it as the 25th most dangerous city in America. A 2019 report in the Asbury Park Press listed Bridgeton at fifth on its list of the state's ten most dangerous cities.[70] In 2022, based on data from FBI Uniform Crime Reports, Bridgeton had 203 violent crimes, ranked ninth highest among all municipalities in the state.[71]

Both were meant to be some variation of NYC but in modern times they've used Chicago and some maps have shown Gotham in NJ.

Greenheads are a species of horsefly, but we always just called them greenheads when we were at or near the beach. What we called horseflies were the giant black or brown ones in the woods/near lakes, and deer flies are a bit smaller and lighter in color
Yep, I know them as horse flies too. They fuckin hurt. Little bastards
I just posted above about these jerks when swimming in pools and how we'd go under so fast like the air was suddenly poisoned. Definitely in fear of them. I referenced them also as pine flies but I think it was horse flies I was trying to recall. 

Side note - I feel so bad when I see horses in the summer and they're stomping their feet, tail whipping yet they're also around their face and eyes. Can't imagine how much they get bit and how they can't scratch the itch really.

MSX [https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/doag/aquaculture/pathology/msxpdf.pdf](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/doag/aquaculture/pathology/msxpdf.pdf)
By Asian varieties do you mean a different species of oyster (perhaps the Japanese oyster) or Asian strains of MSX and Dermo? Many institutions, such as Rutgers, VIMS, UMaine, and NOAA‚Äôs Milford lab, have developed multiple disease resistant strains of Eastern oyster that are now quite common for aquaculture.
What is MSX? (and Dermo?)
There's been a lot written and reported on the re-establishment of oyster aquaculture in that area thanks to the Rutgers bred resistant oyster. There's a lot of farms and leases in that area - it's been a mixed result though, as NJ's regulatory system is not set up like other states like VA and RI have which have seen bigger growth (ironic since we developed the oyster that is saving the damn industry, but our pols won't get out of the way. Istn't that a classic NJ tale?

That is true but Bridgeton is actually outside of that circle. The circled part is the rural area down by the Delaware Bay. Bridgeton is where the dot is at the end of the word on the map and the circled area has very little in common with it.

Not necessarily. There might be overlap, but the only people I can think of that I know that say ""crick"" aren't really the same people that I know that say ""wudder"". Pretty sure that's associated more with other regional accents.
Metropolis is Manhattan north of 14th during the day 

Gotham is NYC south of 14th at night.

Yeah that confused me. Every time I want to go to the beach I always check what the winds will be. Born & raised here in Jersey living no further than maybe 20 min from the beach. I was stumped last summer with all the yellow jackets flying & buzzing all over the beach & around you as you try not to swat at/piss it off. 

And the flies/greenheads/pine flies aren't phased anymore at a majority of the bug sprays out there. I do remember growing up and how nasty they were when swimming in the pool. Someone would see or hear one and scream ""GREENHEAD"" and we all go under water while angrily splashing water above in hopes it will make it go away. 

Along with these big, fat, nasty things, you have mosquitoes and ticks that were created for what purpose? Just to piss us off I'm guessing. Cuz the do a damn good job at it. One of the worst sounds in the world...... A mosquito buzzing right by your ear so you know it's close yet probably won't find it or be able to kill it because they're like smarter than us or something. Gives me chills thinking of that sound.
and then the white ones we call deer flies. Same kind of tenacity and hurt like a MF when they bite

You're definitely confusing Oyster Creek, which was way over by *Lacey* with Hope Creek-Salem, which are the ones that area (it's technically 2 power stations, but they share a complex).

Oyster Creek is the one that closed years ago and is now being decommissioned.

Read a newspaper or something.

Personally, off the top of my head:  
- Student loans - the SAVE plan and any chance of loan forgiveness are dead;  
- Inflation - rates will stay high so I can't save on interest through a refi anytime soon;  
- Inflation - higher COGS for my employer, which will likely impact my salary, and which may even jeopardize the future of the company; 
- Stock market - 401(k) is down - as he likes to say, ""by a lot"";  
- HHS under RFK Jr - higher risk of vaccine-preventable diseases spreading or vaccine approvals being withdrawn, which is not good when you have a toddler;  
- CFPB gutted - if I have a problem with a bank, I no longer have a regulator on my side, I have to take them to court;  
- Dept of Interior gutted and politicized - National Parks understaffed, public lands might be sold off, impacting leisure activities.

Those are just some direct impacts. There's a lot of scary shit happening that points to a complete disregard for the justice system and the rule of law. Coupled with animosity towards a large swath of the population, things are not looking great.

Should I get single family/condo/townhouse/apartment? Looking to rent it out to build equity. I was looking at Morris county but is this a mistake? ",0.07,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jemfdx/rental_property_nnj/,1,1jemfdx,2025-03-19 02:04,"You should have a predetermined idea of what sortve real estate you'll pursue, your cash flow, and future aspirations. You need to know the numbers for property sales past and present, community institutions and demographics, assess the homes based on current valuations, your price, recoupment or sale or extended ownership for every district neighborhood and block.

I work with someone on occasion who purchases strictly middle to upper middle class single family homes--often uninspired sun developments of mcmansion hell scapes. He finds the tenants of single homes tend to stay quite a bit longer and ttake a bit better care of the home. And of course you can charge a premium as they will be overcomped. 

Two-family homes may give you flexibility if one is unoccupied but two sets of tenants and associated potential hiccups. 

Ultimately, two families don't offer nearly the financial advantages of apt buildings or 4+ units. The depreciation flexibility/advantage will save you a ton. This is not to mention the tax breaks offered for often improvements or existing features. 

If youre still clammy about the 500k, you buy a bundle of row houses in trenton and camden for a mid level Mercedes. They will be in tough shape but tnere in lies opportunity. 

In Atlantic City, they have the good neighbors program. Buy a home next to am abandoned lot or home,  you can recieve ownership of that second lot for free as long as you submit your intentions and plans to prove it or rebuild eventually.

The Northern NJ market is still a very hot sellers market so it is a good time to sell if you need to. Reasonably priced homes in desirable areas are still flying off of the shelf and having bidding wars. 

Most experts expect prices in NNJ to further increase but just at a more normal rate compared to the prior few years when everything went crazy.

As for the economy, a bad recession could *temporarily* bring down home prices and interest rates. But lots of people would also lose their jobs so not everyone would be able to take advantage of this. 

I say *temporarily* because history shows that home prices in desirable housing markets always eventually recover and further exceed their prior highs (just like the S&P 500).

Speak to a realtor who specializes in your specific town/county for additional insight.
If you‚Äôre gonna sell it at a reasonable price that someone can actually afford sure if it‚Äôs gonna be overpriced that no one can afford it other than private equity then no
It‚Äôs only in the last 5 years or so that prices eclipsed 2005/6 levels, so the run up in NJ has been mostly market correction IMO. There may be some dips if there is a recession, but the idea we‚Äôre going back to pre COVID pricing is doubtful.
Are you talking Pittstown or Hoboken?
Sell and then downsize or leave to a cheaper city/state? Yes.

As someone in the business of buying/selling/fixing homes .... thats not true. The 'Zestimate' is a farce. I see so many out of whack values on there. Yeah I'm sure alot of them are close, but it's not the end all, be all.
Of course they will. But the real question you should be asking is by the time the prices do start to come down, will they go back down to where I originally bought/sold at or lower than that? Or never go back down to that price point ever again? That's the only thing that really matters.
Is it worse than the estimate you as a reddit user who‚Äôs ‚Äúin the business‚Äù could give based on the post? My intent is not to say it is the end all be all, but I doubt reddit can do a better job.
Really . Yeah :/ I feel like a lot of times owners want way more money than what a Average buyer would want right? I‚Äôm not saying the homes are NOT worth the high price, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not realistic on every day middle class spending on it!!
I see zestimates that are low. And ones that are way high. Take my information as you will- from a stranger. But I certainly make my living in this space. Listen to pros, or believe whatever you want, hey can't force ya.

"Landlord of a 25 unit ""faux lux"" apartment complex violated the Security Deposit Law of New Jersey","My former landlord wrongfully deducted ""cleaning fees"" of $300 (my lease says $100 for excessive dirt/garbage/etc.) But the apartment was spotless because I hired my own cleaners weeks before the walkthrough. They also charged me $700 to ""paint"" some areas of the apartment. However, the apartment is primed, no paint, so the walls show marks very easily. Also my lease says this is for ""damages"" and there is no damages to my apartment. They never put my security deposit in an interest bearing account. When I mentioned this to them, they said that my lease stated that the deposit will be held in a NON-INTEREST BEARING account. This is stated NO WHERE in my lease! Plus, they just admitted to another non compliant act by stating that. They only sent me partial of my deposit with no itemized deductions before hand. (I asked them what happened to the rest and that is when they mentioned the cleaning fees and paint.) Never ever been late on rent, but the apartment always had issues, so I moved out 2 months early, paying 2 rents until the lease of the former apartment was up. 

The gag is, I also rented another apartment in the same building for my sister and the lease ended in Feb. No word from the landlord yet, but I am thinking about sending a demand letter. Both leases under my name, both security deposits are $3,700 each. Thinking if it is worth getting a lawyer at this point.

Where do you get an ez-pass?,"Hey all. I just got here and registered my car online and it says they have shipped my ezpass to my Texas address. Since I'm no longer there, I wont be able to get that tag.

Since I'm staying at a hotel now, how do I get a physical tag? I've tried CVS, port authority, asked around, looked online, nobody seems to know.

On top of that, I've been using the ez pass lane the past couple days but nothing shows up on my account showing that I paid the toll.

Any advice please?",0.3,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jej5jw/where_do_you_get_an_ezpass/,6,1jej5jw,2025-03-18 23:25,"Contact EZPass directly to ask about getting it sent to where you currently are. They may be able to recall/reroute the package. It won‚Äôt show up online until you have the tag. You will probably get a bill in the mail for each offense of passing through without paying though and then you can go into your account and mark that you have it. I forget how it works but I‚Äôve done it before and it was not difficult to resolve.
Call NJ Ezpass
https://www.ezpassnj.com/en/about/csc.shtml

There are physical service centers in camden, newark, and hammonton, but i would call the customer service number to find out if you can get a tag in person.

I have swapped tags there many years ago when the battery died.

Where in Bergen County do you take your car for a ln oil change?,"For those of you who do **not** do their own oil changes, where do you take your car for a quick oil change? 

I live in Bergen County, near Teaneck. Willing to drive as far as Hackensack or Englewood. 

In case it matters, I drive an old Nissan Altima.

You stay in the car while they do the oil change and they don‚Äôt try to push extra services on you.

Any Valvoline would be the same so you can look for one closer to you.
I used to go to Firestone in Hackensack cause my oil changes were $600 (more if I had gone to the dealership) and I could use 0 interest financing at Firestone. They do charge a higher rate than a local place I‚Äôm told. For a local place there‚Äôs a decent spot on Washington Ave in Bergenfield (the steeet Teaneck road becomes as you drive north). I don‚Äôt know what they charge for oil but they charged low rates for other work I had them do. For comparison Firestone wanted like close to 2k for spark plugs and coils and this place let me bring my own parts and pay like 1100. It‚Äôs called Pimentel and it‚Äôs in a delta gas station.
I go to Kassa in East Rutherford.  For my car is $80 and none of the upselling. Plus, recliners and coffee.
Bergen Brakes in Lyndhurst does all my car stuff now but I've also gone to the combination car wash/auto change place in the parking lot of what used to be PathMark (now some kind of gym) on 17S in Hackensack, as well as Kearny Auto Spa but there was nothing about it that would warrant driving from Teaneck.

A friend who used to live in Cliffside Park swore by the Firestone on Anderson Avenue.
When I lived in that area, I always liked the oil change/car wash place on Essex Street at the border of Hackensack and Maywood. Might be too far for you. Jax car wash.

Big Ed's in Fair Lawn, I think it's like $45? Comes with a free wash as well.
Thank you, I‚Äôm familiar with Prospect Park.
Thanks! Wow, $600 for an oil change? Why so expensive?
Thanks, I also dislike the upselling part. But I get that it‚Äôs them trying to stay in business / make a few extra bucks.
Thanks! I think I know which parking lot you‚Äôre talking about. But I think that might be Lodi still, not Hackensack. I may be wrong. Thanks anyway!

Question: Landlord refuse to fix AC,"The landlord told me he doesn‚Äôt have money, so he refused to fix the broken AC. What should I do? Move out? 

Edit for 3rd update:
The landlord wants me to move out and very likely refused to return the deposit. 

Edit for 1st Updates about the landlord:
I just moved in to this place about 2 weeks. 

1. When I moved in the house was extremely dirty, I had to hire professional cleaning service. The cleaning service person told me it was landlord‚Äôs responsibility to provide me w a clean place before I moved in. The landlord agreed to pay for the cleaning after I confronted him w cleaning person‚Äôs statement. 
2. For the first week, sewage water backed up to the whole bathroom floor and kitchen sink. Landlord wanted to charge me half of the plumber fee because the timing is I moved in, then the problem showed up. The plumber told in front of the landlord‚Äôs face that it was years long problem and it has nothing to do with me. Hence the landlord gave up charging me. 
3. The landlord didn‚Äôt tell me the AC is broken until I moved in, he also told me if I want to fix it, he‚Äôll need to increase the rent to cover the fee. 
4. The landlord overcharged me the rent (market price was about 1800 he charged me 2500~ instead). 

Edit for the second update:
The landlord agreed to fix the AC, but need to increase my rent due to AC costs more electricity bill. ",0.78,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jehhtp/question_landlord_refuse_to_fix_ac/,27,1jehhtp,2025-03-18 22:12,"Read your lease. Is AC included? If so then he has to fix it. If not then you‚Äôre out of luck. AC is a luxury and not a necessity under the law and is not a valid reason to withhold rent. Every other detail you wrote here is irrelevant
This already sounds like a nightmare. I'd try to get out if you can. I would also check if whatever town you're in has some version of a tenant advocate. I'm in Hoboken and we have one, but not every town does.
What does your lease say?
Check with your county/city whether the landlord needs to get a CO before renting out a property.  Where I am, it's a $2k fine if they don't get the CO.  The Certificate of Occupancy ensures that the property is habitable before you even move in.
You don't have a landlord, you have a slumlord. I would personally get in touch with an attorney before withholding rent or anything, as usually they will advise against that. In the meantime get everything in writing
If it‚Äôs not too much of a pain in the ass move‚Ä¶.if this shit happens this early on, imagine down the road
you can withhold rent if the ac was part of the deal you made when you moved in.   you need to keep the rent in you account,  send a letter as to why you're withholding the rent.
How does he not have money when *you pay him rent*???
Is it central or window units?  I don‚Äôt believe they need to provide window units if the ones there are broken, luckily they‚Äôre cheap enough to just buy used, it‚Äôs sounding like AC wasn‚Äôt listed on your lease
You should open an escrow account and deposit your rent payments there, and until he fulfills the terms of the lease, he will not get paid.
NJ does not require AC's. If the AC is not specifically called out in the lease, it is not the landlords responsibility, even if it was there when you moved in.

Also for the love of god do not attempt to withold rent based on what you heard from some dude on the internet. There is a specific process you need to follow and document, otherwise you are just not paying rent.

1 it sounds like the landlord fulfilled his obligation to you when the issue was addressed

2 the landlord was wrong to attempt to charge you, but ultimately did not when confronted with evidence. Had your neglect caused the clog, they would have been within their rights to charge you. 

3 we already talked about

4 nobody made you rent from them or agree to their rent. Market price is irrelevant. The only time it comes into play is in renewals and raising your rent then, and even then it needs to be much more egregious, and documented, to matter.

You don't get to stack up complaints that have already been resolved satisfactory, and drag them out when something new comes up.

Edit: Screw you reddit editor
All those other issues are irrelevant to your question.  You asked if he has to replace the air conditioner.  The answer is no, A/C is considered a luxury not a necessity.  You can buy your own window units and take them with you when you leave, they are not that expensive.
Marini Hearing
Implied warranties of habitability 
Thing at top say New Jersey which has the best tenant protection scheme of any communist state. Landlord must fix or you can withhold rent.
tell him ""That's what the rent is for"" and then you can withhold rent if he still refuses to fix it. I bet you he'll find the money. Consult a lawyer, they may setup an escrow account bc you'll need to pay the back rent when it's fixed.
When I visited the place the landlord showed me the control panel of the central air. So I assumed AC is included. However when I moved in he told me the central AC in my floor is broken. Later on, he then blamed me didn‚Äôt ask about the central AC.
He told me he need to pay the mortgage and that sewage bill cost all of his savings. I‚Äôm unsure if I should move out instead.
Wrong answer, it‚Äôs the landlords responsibility to uphold the warranty of habitability. If the AC was there when they moved in, it has to be functional for the terms of the lease to be upheld (for the landlord to get paid).
I never said your landlord isn‚Äôt a scumbag because he clearly is. But the only thing that matters is what‚Äôs written in your lease. This is unfortunately a lesson to learn from. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news
Sucks for him, guess he better take out another loan then. He doesn't get to charge rent for a space that doesn't meet the standards for occupancy. Listing a place for rent comes with obligations, it's not just a fun legal trick to make somebody else pay your mortgage for you.
Only if air conditioning is mentioned in the lease as being included.
The oven, fridge, etc. were also not stated in the lease. So if my fridge malfunction, it‚Äôs justified that the landlord refuses to fix it?
That fact is irrelevant. If the equipment is there, it‚Äôs installed, it worked at one time, it must be repaired as per the warranty of habitability. Note, this is not legal advice, but a tale of experience and a win in small claims, I am not a lawyer and just some dude on the internet.
Things like heat and an oven are considered necessities under the law and therefore don‚Äôt need to be spelled out in the lease. Things like AC or a dishwasher are considered luxuries and need to be specifically addressed in the lease. Although the vast majority of landlords wouldn‚Äôt show you non working appliances as yours did. That‚Äôs a scumbag move and your landlord knows it. I‚Äôd keep a log of all your interactions with him. It may come in handy later if things get worse
AIR CONDITIONING IS NOT REQUIRED.
The landlord now wants me to move out instead.
I‚Äôm not debating that fact, I‚Äôm stating that if it was installed already and the equipment is there and was working. Then the landlord is required to continue maintenance so it‚Äôs usable. You‚Äôre saying that if a toilet is there and it breaks, the landlord does not have to fix it as it wasn‚Äôt in the lease.

I go to [NJMLS.com](http://NJMLS.com)

Just choose the town and all available houses for sale come up. It's so easy!
Find a local agent. Don't do it through zillow, it's just paid advertising. Ask a trusted friend or your lender.


I am an agent, those two sources are where most of my buyer's come from.
I used a realtor like most folks.
Zillow will stick you with an agent that paid for those leads if you hit that contact agent button.

Word of mouth or referred buyers agent would be best.

You'll have to sign a buyers agreement contract now due to the NAR ruling.

Speak to a lender so you have an idea of what you can afford.

If you're in NNJ or CNJ. Good luck...
Redfin, easy to schedule a tour, tech based, use to give you money back at close if you use their site to buy the house not sure if that's the case, Rocket Mortgage just bought them
Zillow is a good start but local realtors are the real way to get actual information and facts. Zillow is just data without knowledge and it's good to get an idea about the local market as a start but I wouldn't buy a house just using it.

Andy is a US Senator.
If they are your elected representative then they should listen to your concerns and be willing to explain their positions as to why they vote the way they do in congress.
Because whether or not you like them or affiliate with their party, these Senators are still representing a whole region of people and have a responsibility to (even if they won't) at least discuss locals' needs and concerns. 

Andy Kim seems the type of guy equipped to face these types of events head-on, from how his campaign went.
To hear the other sides perspective maybe?
Often times it's the opposite - Republicans go to Dem Town Halls, Dems go to Republican Town Halls. 

It's the same concept as a Google review - you're much more likely to leave one if you have a bad experience rather than a good one.
Why not? Maybe people are open to hearing another perspective.
He‚Äôs only one of 2 senators, how often do you get to go to a Town Hall with your Senator? Or at all? And you‚Äôre right, maybe you wouldn‚Äôt for a lower level official like town councilman but this is totally different
This is great, but is it normal for a governor from one state to be doing town halls in another?
Ah, i see, thank you for clarification
Agreed, he rightfully got shit for some of his votes on Trump's appointments but Kim seems like someone would thrive in these Town Halls
Idk do you really need to go to a town hall to hear that?
It‚Äôs not normal, I‚Äôd imagine. But some would say it‚Äôs leadership.

I've heard very mixed things about Elizabeth.  How safe is the downtown area? We're coming from SF area so are unfortunately acquainted with rampant property theft, but it defeats the purpose of living in an urban area if it is unwise to walk home from train after dark.",0.35,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jedm1c/safe_urban_areas_commutable_to_princeton/,17,1jedm1c,2025-03-18 19:31,"New Brunswick sounds like what you're asking for. Only a stop or two from Princeton on the train depending on which you catch. Very much a college town in large part but has what you're asking for. Crime's a thing, focused more towards one side of town, but only personal experience with it was somebody rooting through my car when I stupidly left it unlocked.
Metuchen and New Brunswick are 15-20 minutes away on NEC, Highland Park 15-20 walk across river to NB and it‚Äôs nice chill walkable town. Lots of college faculty and grads.
It's on the small size to be considered ""urban"" but you can definitely get a walkable neighborhood vibe in Bordentown City. Farnsworth Ave has a bunch of great restaurants, 2 breweries, a record shop, cool book shop and some other stuff, a few great bars, and it's walkable to Aldi on Farnsworth Ave as well as to the RiverLine station that can get you to Trenton and then on to Princeton.
The ride from Elizabeth to Princeton is horrendous! The commute will burn you out. New Brunswick is doable as others have told you. The other area is by Trenton but I won't suggest it.¬†
Might as well live in Jersey City if you‚Äôre considering Elizabeth.  Both are doable ( 1 hour commute) but why?  Consider New Brunswick ( college town) , maybe Highland Park, smallish but near New Brunswick, Red Bank, Trenton(iffy) or even Philly.
Lawrenceville is great. Quick drive down the road, alternatively Kingston, but its very small
I live in the Mill Hill neighborhood of Trenton.  It‚Äôs a 10 minute walk to the Trenton Transit Center from my house.  Many of my neighbors commute to Princeton, New Brunswick, Philly, or NYC.  Trenton does have a reputation but our neighborhood‚Äôs biggest issues right now are porch pirates.  There is the occasional car break in but I haven‚Äôt heard of one in a while.  There aren‚Äôt really any grocery stores within walking distance but there are some close.  We‚Äôve also got the Trenton Farmer‚Äôs Market a close drive.
Is downtown Princeton not walkable to trains, groceries, etc? I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs fairly car free living there.
Princeton is on the NJ Transit NE Corridor train line, not many desirable areas to live along the route. I would NOT recommend Highland Park or New Brunswick (not many grocery options, not safe) Maybe Metuchen but the housing market would reflect it. Edison is overcrowded and lots of drug use, not walking distance from a grocery store to the train station. (I lived in the area my whole life and left a year ago when I was 36!) I would stick with something North of Princeton, like Hopewell all the way up to Clinton. Not ""urban"" but great quality of life. Just a heads up 30 min by car in NJ rush hour won't get very far.
You can't get to Princeton by Train from Red Bank unless you transfer at Newark.
Not for a full, ""normal"" grocery shop. There are some small markets to pick up last minute things, but otherwise you're walking 30 min each way to McCaffrey's which runs expensive. The closest chain grocers like Wegman's or Trader Joe's are a 15 min drive away and along Route 1 which is not walkable.
Downtown Princeton is pretty built up, but housing near it is pretty pricey so they're probably a bit further out from it from what they're describing.
I lived in the New Brunswick area by whole life and commuted to Princeton for a decade. I relocated to NW Jersey in Aug 2023.
Metuchen isn't much of a City and Edison isn't one at all.
They could transfer at Rahway. It's  the last mutual station for the Corridor and Coast lines
Ah, frustrating. I think one of the core staples to have a real, walkable downtown is a good grocery store. And going anywhere near Route 1 is the opposite of that. 

Maybe time to start requesting a Trader Joe‚Äôs to open. I‚Äôve heard they pay attention to those!
I completely agree, I was saying this in reference to other people's suggestions. That said, Metuchen was voted the best down in the USA a few years back.¬†"

Wait, is just the NJ group non partisan? Because in NY and VT, it's Democrats, with elected Democrat speakers like Becca Balint etc and it's run by Bernie Sanders former PAC people in the Democrat party and the media group Meidas Touch, which is definitely partisan

We know because they posted dangerous misinformation harmful to veterans in our community stating services for suicidal vets was no longer available and wouldn't remove it, correct it, or state their orgs so the VA had to get involved and we had to spread word locally that this wasn't some foreign influence psyop despite all the foreign flags but for veterans to ignore the misinformation and that suicide hotline and services were in fact still available in our city. We also discovered they're mass and CT residents. It was very aggravating for all.

Some people won't be alive or have their rights in 4 years if this keeps going on?

OK asking because it seems that in some places & posts, it's ""not non partisan"".

The veterans posters nationally are incorrect and therefore locally we all block now for the way we've been treated for asking for veterans sake you correct it. Since you're gaslighting I'm not doing anymore labor for you, you know damn well this is a Democrat party pac and Meidas Touch media, you can find all of us blocking you throughout New York- across spectrum- yourselves. But you already know that, because you have an internal rule to not address third party leftists like me and to continue to go for moderate Republicans. 

The lack of transparency was disgusting even before yoy mass spammed that veterans can't call a suicide hotline any longer and then your group called our local social services workers nazis for pleading with you to stop the misinformation.

You know we can literally see you guys are Democrats right? Here, prove me wrong

Let me know when you get a third party org involved- or *any* grassroots org willing to say so. Anywhere.

We laughed here locally watching an event get slapped together with 3 dozen grassroots orgs involved here in our communities, actually on the ground within 24 hours. Full transparency. They are proud to represent their local org names and efforts. That's real grassroots community organization. 

With a side by side of your non organization event. No community orgs. No community names. No one anyone knows or anyone who even lives within our state let alone city. 

We will all keep waiting for a single grassroots org to step up and say they're involved with you guys. None of us are. And it shows. Try transparency? Might help idk.

Anyway, theres Democrat congressional speakers, spamming from CT. And CT and mass accounts. 

But as you said, as we know, you're redditors out of fed jobs now working for the Dem Party. Anyway good luck. üëç

Certainly
I think they mean non-partisan by the fact that they welcome anyone of any political persuasion or party that‚Äôs anti-Trump. I don‚Äôt think the Lincoln Project necessarily excludes people that are not republican from being members of it or contributing or whatever but it is by definition Republicans that are anti-Trump.
What do you think 'Grassroots' means?
If you know of any local New Jersey republican or third party groups that would be interested in working together, that would be amazing! üôè
Lol Buddy it‚Äôs not even 9am
Well, either way I think it will take a significant level of unity to compete with ""MAGA""
Is it ask stupid questions time?
Sorry, I'm not a Republican. Have you guys tried organizing with the people on your signs? Like

- women's orgs for the Women's one (too many to list)
- postal workers or their union for that one is obvious 
- any veterans at all or their groups for that one is obvious
- some of them are so vague I wouldn't even know what to suggest. Like for the tesla ones, I don't know anyone my class level who has one, the map shows it's not us working class poors who own them that the anti tesla group just doxxed, so idk what to tell you... tesla dealerships aren't in poor or working class communities so good luck to that one

Most of us are watching the news where people who tried protesting the Democrats genocide last year are being rounded up, so. Most of us will continue to avoid nameless spammed events. We know better. 

You know the third parties of your state but they are all, including the libertarians, anti war, so half of these wouldn't work, we know that. 

Most of all though, transparency. Because if this were during Biden, some random group no one will take credit for mass spamming, we'd be screaming from the roofs you're a Russian psyop. And transparency helps keep communities safe. 

And no one wants to go through making effort just to be told we didn't vote hard enough for Schumer Pelosi Raytheon the carcass of biden, or bernie at 87 years old in a couple of years. Our time is too valuable as members of the poor and working classes. Thank you.

Edit:  You're not sure what war has to do with a group that just used veterans as a protest theme? Lol.

And yes, I do block Democrat Party. As you repeatedly state you just want moderate Republicans. So this is for the vulnerable and the left and working class to know not to waste their time. 

Have a great one too, post that to the whole group chat pls ty.

You‚Äôll immediately block me, but whatever. 

I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äòanti-war‚Äô has to do with 50501? But thank you for the feedback!
Currently, the decentralized nature of 50501 means that the local state chapters are left up to small groups of volunteers to organize, finance, run, and promote their own state‚Äôs events.

The NJ organizers would LOVE to connect with and work along side more local groups and populations, but protesting and organizing are still new to us. If you have any contact information about the groups you listed, that would be appreciated! We are especially interested in connecting with unions and more people of color.
Well your post and comment history has framed the context of this conversation quite nicely. Unfortunately, I don't think it's worth the time or effort required to convince a conspiracy theorist of anything. Believe what you will, I suppose. Sometimes the truth...is actually the truth and people are being genuine. We will welcome any Republicans that don't like Trump and anybody who would like to get involved with organizing protests is more than welcome to join our sub. Have a good day!

Ductless Heating & Cooling,Has anyone done the PSE&G mini split/ ductless heating and cooling system? Our home was built in 1930‚Äôs and we have two wall units and baseboard heating.

They work great except our bed room unit leaks when run on cold for too long. Other than that I would say it's worth it over window units.
Is it 2.4 or 0 percent interest rate?
I did the PSEG thing for insulation and whatnot through a third party who set everything up and acted as a GC.  Got 0% over ten years.  There are some nuances to getting it added on, so I found it worth it to go through this other company and not have to deal with it myself.  They can go soup to nuts for you, HVAC, hot water, insulation, the whole nine.  I can provide that info if you DM.

Other than that, I'm more than satisfied with PSEG's end of things.
I have had a Fujitsu Mini-split in a bonus room for over 8 years - works great for both heating and cooling - no issues.  I had mine installed by an HVAC company and took advantage of rebates from the utility company.
Interested to hear how this works out ours just went
The mini splits we had installed are fabulous - for cooling.

They hardly work at all when using them for heat. This is not that big of a deal as the house has a really good radiator system. Too good sometimes. I‚Äôve tried to use the mini splits on really cold days to get the downstairs rooms a little warmer without turning the upstairs into an oven. That doesn‚Äôt seem to work.

They put out warm air, but it doesn‚Äôt change the ambient temperature in the room much. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs because they are up high on the wall, but I really don‚Äôt know that for sure.
It leaks, as in the condensation line is leaking, or is there condensation building up on the fins inside the evaporator in your room?  You've piqued my interest.
Somethings wrong then. My shits are stifling when I throw them into heat mode. Even at 70 degrees they pump out warmth like nobody's business.
From what the technicians told us the condensation line has a dip in it near the unit and that caused a back up of condensation.
That's pretty unacceptable!"

What are the rules for 18 year old drivers that are eligible for a basic license.,"I have gone through the GDL program with my various licenses (permit and probationary) but now what does it mean to have a basic license. I have been trying to understand what are the implications of it through teachers, friends, the MVC website, and even calling MVC (their bot ended hanging up, giving up on contacting a person). I was told through different people that once I am 18, that I can do the following.

- Can‚Äôt drive between 12:01 AM - 5:00 AM
- Keep red decals pertaining to Kyleigh‚Äôs law
- I can drive anytime now 
- Don‚Äôt need to have red decals

This is research from online (MVC and NJ.GOV) and also through my school‚Äôs driving instructor (specifically the 12:01 AM curfew and keeping the decals) and other people saying that‚Äôs not how it works.

On top of all of this why is it so hard to find a direct answer to this sort of thing. I read on a law forum how theres a lot of loopholes in this stuff but I don‚Äôt understand why they would make it difficult to be straight forward about advancing to a basic license.

Back then you can have a Driver License from one state and a non driver license in another state. However because of the state to state verification system, you can only have one.

It might be alright this time of year, but cheesequake gets a LOT of mosquitos. I would personally not risk it, but maybe ive just had bad luck.
I'm trying to find a cheap venue for a surprise birthday party and not having luck. Even firehouses are over $1k somehow! I just saw a review on Thompson Park that someone had trouble even walking there because of the geese crap and none of the pavilion sites are available for when I would need. I'm getting pretty disheartened lol
Thanks for the info! I think I'm moving away from Cheesequake.... Have you ever been to Thompson Park in Monroe Township?
What time of year if you don‚Äôt mind? I was considering parks for wedding for similar reason. It‚Äôs crazy! You might want to try a YMCA or similar community center. Sometimes churches/knights of Columbus type places will rent their spaces too. The park can be really nice depending on time of year, we did a cheesequake birthday for my kids 5th - the picnic space is nothing to write home about but it‚Äôs okay for a kid party. The lawns by the playground can get very buggy
I'm looking for this April. I'm tempted to go to some other parks in the area but they are a lot more expensive. I also hear the area is being overrun by geese right now but I don't know if cheesequake is one of them.

It‚Äôs bad on 95 in Philly but the worst is the DFW Metroplex that I‚Äôve seen.
It's a realignment of ad dollars. There is more ROI to pay influencers than outdoor advertising. So the cost of entry is much lower when Bud and Coke don't need a billboard.
I love their websites: www.Igothitbyacrazynewjerseydriverandiamgoingtosuethem.com
Maybe Rob sells nj is subletting his billboards?
What I've noticed is that those billboards always just said       

""Brandon J. Broderick   
Attorney at Law""      

and this new spate of billboards explicitly advertise as personal injury or being fighters in court or bulldogs or whatever.

Apparently, per the representative, this year there have been many returns that were pulled for verification before being released (yet we the people anxiously waiting) are not notified! Thankfully I got a nice lady helping me, she asked a few basic questions to confirm identity and she also needed details from my NJ-1040, after being put on short holds a couple of times, BOOM my refund has been approved.

I filed 1/30 and I‚Äôm still processing. I uploaded documents just in case. Every person I talked to said it doesn‚Äôt look like I need verification or uploaded documents. Someone told me they don‚Äôt start processing the returns until feb 13th  this year.
Just called and got booted out because of high call volume; apparently the volume is so high they can't even put people on hold to wait to speak to an agent. Pretty annoying. What time of day did you call? Thanks for sharing the number with us, hopefully I can get through, since I filed like at the end of January and it's *still* processing...

Hopefully what you uploaded today will help move things along for you, let‚Äôs stay positive for an outcome in way less than 30 days.

Keep calling, I went through the same thing try a little after 12pm. Remember most people call early in the day. Don‚Äôt stop until you speak to someone
Same. I think it's because they hire like 3 people (How else would Murphy afford his giant McMansion?) to do literally anything on the state level.
I just kept calling back, it took me about 6 calls until I finally got through. I spoke to someone at like 12:15pm. Two days after the call, my status updated to approved with a DD of 3/25 but I received my refund on 3/21. Keep calling until you through, I would think early afternoon is best.

It picked up the date of the ruling ‚ÄúFeb 12, 2025‚Äù from the publish date of this article: https://www.weiner.law/nj-law-blog/client-update-new-jersey-first-act-ruled-unconstitutional/
Yup, this is it ‚Äî the law is in limbo right now because courts have found, upon challenges, that the law is unconstitutionally vague as it relates to waivers but have no taken it upon themselves to rewrite the statute‚Ä¶ and the legislature has simply not taken action on that, leaving the law in place 

This leaves employees in a weird place where they have to risk being fired for the Act, even if they were to challenge that firing they would almost certainly prevail
It‚Äôs interesting because I grew up in Hunterdon and when I was a kid it seemed like it was almost the norm for younger teachers at my public school to live across the border in like Yardley or that general area. More affordable but also just more suitable for people in their 20s than the towns in Hunterdon, which was still mostly farmland at the time. 

This was the decades ago though, so obviously well before that law came about
[deleted]
OP‚Äôs question is, has the law been shot down?  Answer is, no.

So, since nothing happened, it‚Äôs safe to say that police and firefighters are entirely unaffected.
Firefighters at least are not allowed to live out of state and haven't been for a long time. Since police are the same pension system I'd figure it's the same thing.


That doesn't apply post retirement.


Civil service jobs can require you live in the relevant town or city prior to, during application and up to a year after appointment. But you are allowed to move elsewhere after that initial year.
Do you actually own a home in NJ and not realize that your property taxes are set by your LOCAL MUNICIPALITY and not the State?  That the state doesn‚Äôt get a single penny of your property tax? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
King phil stated if taxes are a concern, nj was probably not the state for you.  Sucks for those of us born, raised, and have families of our own here  huh?
The court found that the standard for waivers was unclear, vague, and was not treated consistently which is a due process violation

get covered nj health insurance help,"hi everyone, i will soon need to apply for health insurance through get covered nj but i have a unique situation and am not sure how the process will look for me

i work internationally and return home to new jersey from june-september every year. i've previously been covered under my parents insurance but i am turning 26 in june this year right before i come home for the summer

1. how far in advance do i need to apply/set it up?

2. my parents took me off of their marketplace insurance plan since i'm abroad so i'm not on their plan right now, but turning 26 will still qualify me regardless, right?

3. will i be able to cancel the plan at the end of the summer before moving abroad again?

4. does anyone have any idea of about how much it might cost me monthly? every time i try to use the calculator on the get covered website it gives me some sort of problem. i will be a 26 year old female with no conditions, non smoker, etc. - im generally very healthy and since i work internationally in lower cost of living countries my income is very low (about $15k usd a year)

If my experience is still relevant, I lapsed coverage between my former employer and getting individual coverage by one month.  Aetna told me that if I had any major health issue during the next 12 months of coverage it would qualify as a ""pre-existing condition"" and not be covered.

EDIT: I am referring to a very specific bagel shop, and I‚Äôd like to give them the kudos, but naming it would pretty much dox me because it is a single location. But I would drive to this place for bagels if I didn‚Äôt live around the corner. OTOH, for most of NJ the corner bagel shop near you is so good that there is no reason to look further.
I'm not telling... Shit's already busy enough as is
Is anyone really traveling to other bagel shops? The best bagel shop is the one you like most in your area. When I was in Fort Lee it was Boulevard Bagels. Now it‚Äôs Kinderkamack Hot Bagels. Tomorrow it might be elsewhere

Growing up I loved International Hot Bagels in Belleville. The lady that worked there loved me and I would remember getting like a dozen free mini bagels as a kid on Sunday. They don't hit the same now though, I'm not sure if they got new owners but they have much less variety and they got smaller post pandemic.

There's a bagel shop on RT46 in Fairfield (can't remember the name) but they have the best everything flagels.

I'm ISO of a new spot in the Hopatcong area though.
Kosher Bagel Supreme in springfield is pretty awesome. But like many other people said, there are plenty of great bagel shops all over northern NJ, no need to travel.

I actually like that while people will drive to try a well-known pizza place, nobody will do that for bagels. We all think our local bagel place is better than everyone else's lol. That being said, Bagel Pantry in Metuchen is the best in the area. It's also a warning not to go if you don't already because the line always gets too long lol.

Also, Metuchen is Central Jersey, but I don't know if OP thinks we exist or if everyone north of them is from ""North Jersey"".

Mountain Lakes Bagels. Try the THEC on an Everything bagel fresh out of the oven. Heavenly.
Bagel Nosh is Waldwick.

I know most people go to the closest one, but these bagels are seriously better than all others I have tried. And when I am on the giant line (that moves really fast) I meet people all the time from several towns away that drive over bc these bagels are so good.

Everything Bagel and Hot and Toasty Bagel in Bayonne. I‚Äôm sticking with my hometown because I‚Äôm not driving out far for a bagel. Both are excellent with the former having the edge of being a bit cheaper and closer to me.
The only answer is Bagel Pantry in Metuchen. 

I have been going here for the better half of my life and have not found a place that even comes close to their BEC.
I'm not telling my go-to one, I don't need to wait longer than I do now. But, here's the thing about bagel shops. There are the ones that have what you might consider the best. Then there are ones that have bagels that are good enough for the level of effort you have to expend. Ex. The ""best"" bagels are a 30-minute drive away. But, a place that is good enough is a 5-minute drive away. Good enough will win 95 times out of 100.

This doesn't even begin to account for the places that have better bagels but somehow worse bagel sandwiches.

My favorite spot is J&J bagels in Ridgefield. Those are fat sumbitches and I love every grain. Delicious BEC

JT‚Äôs Bagel‚Äôs in Lacey, by a long shot!! Second best would be that bagel place in Clifton near the Barnes and Noble. I don‚Äôt know if that is the one you are talking about. But it‚Äôs awesome.

Edit: I am dumb and just realized you said north Jersey lol. In that case, the Clifton bagel shop. But I looked it up, and it wasn‚Äôt the one you were talking about. I tried finding it on Google Maps, but I can‚Äôt find it. I swear it was in Clifton Commons next to the Stop and Shop.
The answer is the best one within 5-10 minutes of your home - which for me is actually the Bagel Station in the post.  Closest bagel shop to me and it's been my go-to since moving to the area \~14 years ago.

River Road Hot Bagels in Fair Lawn for a breakfast sandwich, especially their Taylor Ham is pretty loaded. Teaneck Road Hot Bagels for kosher bagels, and lately I've been pretty into Java Day Cafe in Ridgefield Park. Also Bagel Nosh in Waldwick, I travel around for work and I like bagels.
Kinderkamack Hot Bagels in River Edge
Bagel Buffet Secaucus. Their everything bagel has salt (some shops stopped putting salt on everything in the last decade), and their vegetable cream cheese is not giant chunks of red peppers... More Finely diced.
It‚Äôs a little out of the way, but worth it if you‚Äôre in the area: Cozy Corner Bagels & Deli in Hackettstown. It‚Äôs a really tiny mom & pop joint but the food is very tasty & well priced. I stop by there for food when I hike Steven‚Äôs State Park which is also in the area.

Is boulevard bagels on Bergen blvd? If so, they aren‚Äôt good anymore unfortunately
there can be when the one closest to you is kinda terrible.
I live in Somerville, and despite our robust restaurant scene, we have a dearth of legit bagelries.  There's a Clinton Bagel coming, been coming for a while.  But I shoot up the mountain to Gabe's Bagels, which are excellent.  Bagels 4 U in Raritan are great bagels, but the service *leaves a lot to be desired*.  And Gabes has better sandwiches, IMO.
Yeah.... Totowa bagel, Teaneck Road Hot Bagels, the punk rock bagel spot in clifton, bagel cafe spot in New Providence. All over 40+ min away. Local ones just aren't as good. I'm ordering lox, capers, tomatoes on an everything bagel toasted w/ scallion cream cheese and a plain toasted w/ cream cheese at spots to judge them. Last couple of times has been the to punk rock bagel spot in Clifton so I guess they've been my fav lately.
Agree i have bagel shops all over mt area im not traveling for a bagel period
Came here to say that.
Best bagel and lox in NJ
Ooooh, they open at 5 am. I'll leave for work, and go out of my way next time. I live in Rockaway and work in Kearny, so not TERRIBLY out of the way.
This.
The absolute GOAT of tuna spreads
They lose points for no hot sandwiches
Was going to be my comment verbatim. It is not close.
I grew up in Fair Lawn, and after moving away and having other places, I was extremely underwhelmed with their BEC w/SPHot sauce the last two times I had it while visiting home.

Their bagels w/cream cheese are great, but that hot sandwich was sorely lacking for me.

Having said that, I also hope they never go anywhere. That place is a town staple and needs to live on. I was really bummed hearing about Gio's recently.
The best bagels I've had in my life
Good but Clifton plaza bagels are better and they have much better variety.
The best ü´∂
They have a sister location in Clifton and imho their bagels don‚Äôt taste bagel-y enough. More roll-y. But to each their own
I remember Bagel Train being absolutely clutch whenever I woke up hungover at a friend's place at Ramapo.
Bagel Train‚Äôs pumpernickel and their cinnamon raisin are the best I‚Äôve had of those types.
Puts all other local bagel places to shame. They are so much better than anything else I‚Äôve had in the area
Yes pretty decent. Though I've found they are good fresh, next day they go stale pretty quickly
I actually prefer Brooklyn Bagels in the same town. And the employees seem happier there.
Alfa is peak!
Alfa has two locations? I only knew about Randolph. Their bagels are good but not the best. I prefer Brooklyn Bagels down the road (behind Randolph Diner).
If you haven't already, Mountain Lakes Bagels is fantastic.
This guy bagels
Have my upvote. I immediately knew you meant Plaza Bagels!. I‚Äôve never found a better bagel since stumbling upon this place. We‚Äôre in Morris county now and we still talk about nothing comparing to them.
Where is punk rock bagels
Really good lighter taste bagels.
They also have a sister location in Clifton and it‚Äôs  pretty ok
Its almost better to ask whats the shittiest bagel place.
seconding this. they also make a pastrami egg and cheese that‚Äôs so good
Woah over Alfa?
Get a hash brown, takes the sandwich to another level
Hot Bagels on Saddle River Road has been my go to spot for decades. I love that they keep things simple and just make bagels. I think the reason they don‚Äôt make sandwiches is because they‚Äôre kosher. Not many bagel shops are!
Their Taylor ham is grossly weird tho, super low budget. Love their jalape√±o cheddar bagel tho.
Baldwin bagels is good too
My dad used to work in Bethlehem. First time he got breakfast sandwiches out there for his team they came on hamburger buns. Bought a hot/cold bag and would stop local and get them on bagels before heading out to PA.  His team looked forward to them every week.
That place is INSANELY good. As a NJ native, the first time I had their bagels, I was blown away.
This is correct
Damn, I didn‚Äôt realize they closed because I moved to Central Jerz üòî Were they a victim of Covid?
It‚Äôs literally called Clifton bagels. Been to that target so many times but never stopped in that bagel place. Will definitely give it a try next time in target.
Hackensack one is eh. We go sometimes for convenience though.
Place stinks ..
Great call
Ike‚Äôs in Livingston has a pretty massive bagel. In my top 3 for taste too.
I didn‚Äôt even know Stew had bagels! Gotta go to a local dedicated bagel spot for sure.
The bagel place in Garfield that takes cash only is better.
Good luck finding a parking spot though
You bastard!
Gatekeeping is ok when breakfast sandwiches are involved. I don‚Äôt make the rules
There‚Äôs 4 within less than a mile or less of house
Yes, on the border of Pal Park and Fort Lee. That‚Äôs a huge bummer.
I like Kettlemen‚Äôs ( Somerset and Bridgewater) and Bagel Garden in Branchburg. And the one in the same parking lot as BoundBrook ShopRite.
\*in the world!!
Same for me.
Have you been to the Bloomfield spot? I haven‚Äôt been to Clifton (I‚Äôll have to check it out for science) but I know there is definitely a noticeable difference in quality between the Bloomfield and Montclair locations. Neither is bad but for me Montclair is fine while Bloomfield is very good. So it stands to reason that if you think Clifton is just ok Bloomfield might be a step up.
Thank you for articulating that. I couldn't figure out how to describe them.
there‚Äôs another sister spot in South Orange, which i don‚Äôt recommend either.
The ladies at Alfa Bagel love my wife, so I‚Äôve heard the owner is a bit rough. Love the bagels though
Sorry, I did mean the Brooklyn Bagel place. Alfa only has the one, but I just assumed everyone went to Brooklyn bagel when the parking lot was too nuts at Alfa, hence the other place.
when they're not burning the shit out of your toasted bagels, they're great.  the lady owner sucks though.  she's so annoyed by your existence.
I‚Äôm up near Andover, so it‚Äôs a helluva trek, but I‚Äôve heard that every time I bring up Alfa bagel in this sub. I‚Äôm gonna have to head over eventually
Clifton. Not sure exactly where but I‚Äôve had their bagels & they‚Äôre the best. It‚Äôs not called Punk Rock Bagels, that‚Äôs just what everyone calls it‚Ä¶lol. I have no idea what the real name is.
Never been to that one. I think they have one in Montclair too.
The Clifton location is very good though its been a few years since I've been there.
And that honor  goes to *drumroll*‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Dunkin‚Äô Donuts. Every time I‚Äôm in a dunks in New Jersey and see someone order a bagel I internally scream! Especially since the dunks near me is literally a 1-2 minute walk from a good actual local bagel spot.

![gif](giphy|FBXHQUObh0ryE)
Alfa would be close second!
Alpha is my favvvvv and A&B bagels in Andover
Yes I agree - Alfa is good Brooklyn is better
Never had it. Their Philly cheese is great imho
I believe it. The food here doesn't compare to NJ, NY or Philadelphia. There's a few places I'd maybe recommend, but nothing crazy either. 

People out here underestimate an amazing bagel. When you find a good one, you never want the low level crap again. Same with pizza. It changes you üòÇ 

I've been all over NJ. I'll drive 2 hours into the state for a good meal over anything in Lehigh Valley.
Totally amazing. Always a line out the door for good reason.
Lol! Clifton Bagels! I never looked at their store front to see the name. Someone recommended that place to me, and it‚Äôs been great every time. The staff isn‚Äôt the friendliest but I don‚Äôt care. They are quick and the bagels are tasty! ü•Ø
I don't recall asking for your opinion.
Whatever you say, big boy.
They used to have a really nice onion and swiss bagel, but they cut the recipe in half and now its small enough to be a large mini bagel
Stew‚Äôs makes their bagels in house daily fwiw
I always seem to
Funny, Kettleman's used to be the Coffee Grinder Cafe, where I spent a lot of time in high school, and Bagel Garden ownership changed a couple years after I got out of high school, and I thought the quality dipped a bit.  Haven't been to Kettleman's though, for some reason, I forget about it a lot.
Never been to the Bloomfield location. But tbh there‚Äôs so many better bagel spots in Clifton that are literally less than 1/2 a mile from bagel station in Clifton in my opinion
Yw
A&B ain‚Äôt bad by us but good luck going on a Sunday AM¬†
That's fair, I personally prefer mountain lakes, it's probably ~15 mins further east than Alfa. Alfa is also fantastic though

Ah that‚Äôs disappointing, I love an onion bagel!
Fair enough! I‚Äôm a Montclair and Bloomfield girl through & through so spoiled for choice :)
HBA, Beyond the Bagel, and Sunrise have never failed me!
I'd check the ingredients list on their bagels. I've found that if you look closely, most of their products are full of preservatives and other weird stuff. Their ""maple syrup"" is like 40% corn syrup.
They are different stores run by different people. The one in Bloomfield has some of the best bagels Ive ever found.
I hate the meth vibe from that one lady who‚Äôs been there forever. It‚Äôs good, but it ain‚Äôt worth it to me.
Yes it‚Äôs plaza bagel in clifton
SO GOOD
Don't yuck my yum. And learn how to reply.
I Al also spoiled for choice, but hell, stews bagles arw always good, and I tend to grab one when I‚Äôm in there for other stuff out of convenience
I‚Äôll definitely check it out when I‚Äôm in there neighborhood next

How to Petition for Sidewalks on a Block,"Hello. I'm moving to Westfield, NJ, and my house is on a busy main road. I've noticed that there are no sidewalks on my block, although sidewalks exist a few blocks away and in small, scattered sections in front of some properties. I have a dog, and it's very uncomfortable and unsafe walking along the curb with cars driving toward us.

I'm wondering if it's possible to petition the town to add sidewalks in front of properties on my block. In a hypothetical scenario where all the residents on the block want a sidewalk, could we pool funds together and build it ourselves? How does that process work?",0.47,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1je3y6e/how_to_petition_for_sidewalks_on_a_block/,51,1je3y6e,2025-03-18 12:38,"The first thing I would do is contact the town to figure out if there's an existing process for this.  It may range from ""lol, get fucked"" to ""fill out this form and wait 3-15 years"" to ""talk to Kyle in room 301b""

At least then you'll know if it's worth pulling resources to yell at local politicians or to build it yourselves or whathaveyou.
city council and/or traffic board most likely. 

Sidewalks should require easements, which effectively will force land owners to give up property and take on liability.  

It's not a super popular or easy thing, this was a thing in a neighborhood near where I lived and it ultimately never got done for those reasons.
first of all as a Westfield resident, welcome. second of all you don't. took my street 65 years to get some simple patches in the road.... after 20 petitions from multipule residents
There‚Äôs a grant towns can get for safe routes. It‚Äôs a program to increase walking and biking to schools. Maybe that would help?
I asked the same thing in South Jersey.  According to the town, building sidewalks is an option that goes in when the road is built. If you own the property after the toad was laid down, a sidewalk would have to be built at private expense on your property. It‚Äôs mostly due to public money being used to improve private land. The only exceptions are when the road is widened, but you would be including it in the eminent domain offer, or when required by law for the wheelchair accessible corners.

If you are in a neighborhood without any sidewalks, you can either get together with the other owners and make your own network of sidewalks. If you have an HOA neighborhood, then the HOA can make the arrangements.
If you're successful, just make sure you have a snowblower and offer to clear the snow from the other houses sidewalks as well.
Welcome to Westfield, neighbor! Moved here from the south where sprawling properties & sidewalks were the norm. So when house hunting, I kept angrily noticing the non-sidewalks & thinking this state/town is crazy for not having them everywhere! I live on a quiet south side st without sidewalks but the drivers here are careful. The town has put in more stop signs & speed bumps the past few years. I got used to it. You‚Äôll see runners, bikers, families, everywhere in Westfield. You have beautiful parks in town (Mindowaskin, Tamaques)& neighboring towns a few min drive away too (Nomahegan, Lenape, Unami, Echo Lake, Watchung Reservation). 

The proximity to green spaces, safety, education, & DT were huge factors for coming here.  You can go walking on the sidewalk streets too. I personally love Shadowlawn Ln. as it reminds me of the street I grew up on down South üò¨. Hope the welcome wagon lady comes to visit you! That blew my mind & really made me feel welcome. ü§ó
Moving into a town and already wanting to change it is peak upper middle class behavior lol
You can always add sidewalks yourself, although many prefer not to so they don't have to worry about maintenance, upkeep and liability.  The town most likely will not unless they get a grant earmarked for it.
People are downvoting you because NJ is full of assholes who hate on everyone and everything. I think its great that you're wanting to do this, and I applaud the idea of pooling for one with your neighbors. That's the kind of community engagement we need to see more of.


My advice is to contact the town, not reddit, and see what they have to say.


Update us if you ever manage to make it happen!
You could ask the town. IDK if there's an easement for a sidewalk you could install.  But shouldn't you have thought this through when buying your house? Like oh wow this is a busy road! Oh wow this doesn't have sidewalks. Hmm maybe I should think about this.
Pretty sure sidewalks fall on the homeowner, if you want a sidewalk you gotta put it in
its really hard to get this done on an existing property. The owners would be rightfully agravated by the town taking their property to add something they will suddenly have a legal obligation to maintain in the winter. They also may feel it is unsightly. 

To make it clear im not against sidewalks, i think more areas should have them. I just value property rights more and dont feel its right to spring a liability and burden on someones shoulders that they didnt sign up for.

Footnote: im so glad to be done salting and scrapeing this year (hopefully) what a bitter cold and icy hell it has been.
It costs a lot of money. So
I believe it's all on the homeowner for putting in a sidewalk, but of course there are going to be permits needed. Most likely you'll have to find a contractor for it. It's frustrating to walk down some stretches in my neighborhood and go from beat up concrete to beat up slate to new concrete then walk in the street for a house or two as you go down a single street.
Every town has a website with contact information. Contact the town and seek advice from the appropriate people who can help you.
Aren't those responses the same thing? The last two are just different ways of telling you to get fucked.
:-/
Thank you so much! This information is very helpful! Once I'm fully settled in, I will try to talk to my neighbors to get to know them better and see if it's worth discussing their opinion about a sidewalk.
LMFAO¬†


I think digging in your heels and trying to prevent your block from ever changing exemplifies that much more


No, MY development was the last ethical change, everything afterwards is basically communism being enforced by newcomers, unlike my noble heritage that's inhabited this suburb since far back in the 1980s, after they built this new on ramp
Remeber, never try to change your surroundings folks /s
How is wanting a safe way to walk around your neighborhood upper middle class? If anything, and this is still a massive stretch, it's working class because it means you're less reliant on a car to interact with your own community.
Westfield is not anywhere middle  class. It's a town where people will tell you how great it is even when you could care less. There are more signs on lawns complaining about so many causes It's comical.  OP sounds like a perfect fit.
Yeah OP go ahead and pour some concrete on your Westfield front lawn and see what happens
I thought about getting a quote from a contractor, but that defeats the purpose of having a sidewalk?
Thanks! Very encouraging. Once I fully settle in and get to know my neighbor better, I will know better about what to do next.
Like there are a lot of options for a reasonable price on the market lol. My options are limited. If I have $ 1 million in my pocket, I‚Äôll definitely be more selective, but I don‚Äôt.
Could the town avoid the property rights stuff by making it a one way street, and add a side walk? That's what I see in hoboken/NYC/JC
I agree. By petitioning the town, in my head I was thinking the town can create incentive plan to encourage property owners to collaborate on sidewalk construction.
I grew up there, and I can't tell you how many times I almost wiped out on the slate! I pretty much walked everywhere, and between the hills, tree roots, etc., it was quite the obstacle course!
That's so sad, especially given how expensive properties have become. I am thinking of giving pamphlets to my neighbors and asking if anyone wants to pool funds together to make a nice stretch of sidewalk. I heard that in some places, people do this to add shared fences with neighbors. But it's a bit beyond my comfort zone :-\\.
I researched a lot of town information and did see the permit. It appears to be on individuals, and it‚Äôs confusing. A sidewalk clearly benefits more than just the homeowner. I‚Äôm here to ask if anyone has experience asking around with neighbors and pooling funds beforehand. Also, it‚Äôs a good way to see what the status quo is
im still tryna figure out which main road you would live on that doesnt have a sidewalk.  

it would have to be north ave west next to the middleschool cuz i think there's a section that just doesn't have sidewalk but across the road there is?
It‚Äôs Westfield - if you‚Äôre north of the tracks and there‚Äôs no sidewalk it‚Äôs by design. If you‚Äôre south of the tracks they just don‚Äôt care.
Even if the township puts them in, they are the responsibility of thr homeowner to maintain
OP sounds like a perfect fit because they want to feel safe while walking along the road?
I guess but they still would typically be required to keep it safe in the winter, so its still something they would wanf to fight
There isn't a ""status quo"" because there are too many variables. These variables include what kind of neighbors you'll have, the relationships that you'll have with them, how much resources they are willing to use on this project, and if they view the sidewalk as a necessity. As in, is it a neighborhood full of kids? Have there been safety issues/concerns?

>A sidewalk clearly benefits more than just the homeowner.

I agree, but you'll find someone who will tell you that they've managed to function without it so far.
In my area, not even across the street. lol  
Also it's like a tiny block that the speed limit is 35, few blocks towards north or south have speed limit 25 too lol
I feel like parts of Springfield Avenue don't have a sidewalk.
OP might be better off just telling their neighbors to slow tf down. In my experience, it generally isn‚Äôt the nonresidents passing through who are making those roads unsafe for pedestrians
This. There are towns where this sort of this is possible. Westfield is far from that kind of town.
My colleague mentioned that, in the past, a high school student was killed at a busy intersection on the street where I live because there wasn't a traffic light to manage left turns. The town eventually installed a pedestrian signal in response to the tragedy, but the tragedy could have been prevented if the issue had been addressed earlier. I guess people just don't care enough until they realize their own lives can be screwed
woah where the fuck in westfield are you, no sidewalks in your area on a main road??
maybe, i go to a boarding school so i'm not around a lot but from what i remember N Ave W has a section w out a sidewalk
Not from Westfield, but it varies in my area


Theres a stop sign that's very commonly blown on my side street by people, either just rushing or specifically trying to bypass congestion on a busy parallel road


Some of the people doing it move literally around the corner from it, I see them park there.


Others then proceed to race up the 25 mile an hour side street at 40+.


And it's already too narrow in most sections for cars to pass each other thanks to parked cars on both sides, so short of a permanent cop I'm not sure what the solution is
That's sad and completely avoidable. If you have time, maybe attend a town meeting or school board meeting. Most of these meetings are virtual if you can't attend in person.  This would give you a ""feel"" of the town.  If the community is active, then you'll probably have no issues getting people involved. The only family that requested a sidewalk that I know of paid for it all by  themselves because no one was interested in helping. I also can't confirm if people weren't interested because they insisted on cobble stones for the sidewalk in front of their house, which may have been too much of an expense for their neighbors, but who knows?
South, close to Clark. I joked to my friend that I live in the poor part of the town lol, I guess it's not a joke after all :D
I‚Äôve read this story so many times in different towns in NJ. Residents complain about speeding, police do a ticket blitz, and they find out the most prolific offenders are the locals themselves.
I'm not even gonna lie, if it is N Ave W it'll be one of the buisiest roads especially during the summer with people tryna get to the pool but i don't really think that not having a sidewalk is too big a deal on that street in particular because the lawns usually extend pretty far down and most neighbors are friendly enough to let people walk dogs on their lawns as long as they're not shitting and leaving the shit there
HAHA, you'll get used to the south side north side jokes, it sounds a lot like a 90's mob movie movie with all the EY YOU FROM DE SOUTH SIDE O TOWNE. YEAH IM FROM DE SOUTH. AH YOU FUCKIN BROKIE. but yeah that side is often neglected. I live really far north, almost in Scotch plains. In fact, 2 streets behind me IS scotch plains and they tend to not really do much here either. the rule with Westfield is, the farther you are from the center north side, the worse it gets."
Metro Cat Rescue saved Dutch from the streets.,"Dutch is one of a number of pet cats saved by a Metro Cat Rescue volunteer after they were abandoned in the street near where community cats are cared for.  Strangely, these pet cats were neutered as TNRs (ear-tipped) and then just let loose.

When we brought Dutch in, he had a rash on his neck.  Treating for fleas took care of that.  A few months later, he had to go to the vet for an upper respiratory.  His third and most serious illness was a urinary tract infection.  Antibiotics knocked out the bug, but it took Dutch many weeks to regain his strength.

Take the train to princeton as early as you can and then take the train to penn back. Then look up how often that line is late and delayed, and you will have an informed opinion.
90 minutes on NJ transit  can easily feel like 2.5 hours! It's like  the interstellar movie!
Bear in mind the morning rush hour trains frequently get into NY Penn late, so you should tack on an extra 10-15 minutes to whatever the NJ transit timetable says.

The train will be crowded, and it can sometimes be difficult to get work done. My 4x weekly commute is roughly 45 min on the train, and that feels like a good length to me. From Princeton you‚Äôre probably looking at a 90 min ride, even on the express. 

And you have to factor in either taking the Dinky or driving to Princeton Junction from wherever you‚Äôll actually be living.

Not trying to discourage you, many many people do the commute you‚Äôre describing and have for years. Just letting you know what to expect
Express train is about an hour. Expect door to door commute of 90-120 minutes. Trains are still not as packed as they used to be pre Covid. Can usually get a seat on the train. Still plenty of parking at Princeton Junction. Any delays can suck the life out of you. 

There is a new residential area being built right next to the train station. It is unclear how that will affect traffic in the area.
There are hundreds of people from the area who do this. I was one of them until recently. You either take the Dinky train or the TigerTransit bus to Princeton Junction Station and then catch the northbound train. It takes 55 to 75 minutes to get to NY Penn, depending on the schedule of trains, some of which are express. PJC has plenty of daily and permit parking if you come by car, but I don't know about availability at the moment. Sometimes the Northeast Corridor simply breaks down and people find each other at PJC or Penn and usually share a ride. Although train tickets are honoured on NJ Transit buses, it usually gets so chaotic.
Thanks for the idea, but I‚Äôm looking for someone‚Äôs personal opinion who has done this for a year+
The express trains are 60ish minutes. Based on my commute to Newark, they're reliable in the morning and less so in the afternoon/evening. Plus, you have to contend with the mad dash in NYP when the platform is announced.
Appreciate it- thanks!
Appreciate the response- good to keep in mind üëç
Thanks for the feedback!
Thank you!
Maybe try /r/NJTransit
Haha thanks for the feedback! If you can get a seat,  do you work on the work to make the time go faster? Or zone out/read/etc?
Thanks for the feedback!
I zone out typically. Music or podcasts. I almost always get a seat both ways, often with nobody next to me.
There's no desk or anything like on Amtrak


I used to commute up to Newark on the coast line, you can definitely get some emails and stuff done, plenty of people do. Plenty of others nap or just read
I did this for years the earlier the train the less likely to hit delays.  They have express trains from Princeton Jct to Penn in the morning and vice versa in the afternoon.  There can and absolutely will be delays with overhead line issues and single tracking in and out of the tunnel but it is not terrible.

  
There is a long wait list for a parking permit at Princeton Jct so it may be daily parking rates for a while.
Thanks! Appreciate the tidbits üëç

Garden State Mall (Paramus) - 10 minutes from the ice rink.

Applebee's (Hackensack) - 10 minutes from the ice rink.
White Manna is nothing special IMO but if you want to do it, make sure you order ahead of time.  Their flat top is comically small and you'll need to order a couple hundred burgers for a hockey team, which probably isn't an exaggeration."

At the rate we‚Äôre going there won‚Äôt be any green space left in New Jersey. Everything is clear cut for giant Amazon shipping facilities, and ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù housing mandates.
This needs to be stopped, they should upzone existing single family neighborhoods.
>In New Jersey, if town officials say no to a developer‚Äôs plans, that developer can ask a judge for what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúbuilder‚Äôs remedy.‚Äù It's essentially a court order that forces a town to allow the development of more affordable housing. And in a situation like that, the Township Council could have very little control over what gets built.

The objections to the project are (1) increased flooding for everyone living around the project, (2) single road access to the planned apartment community is unsafe, and (3) as affordable housing, it's too far from schools, supermarkets, etc.  The quote makes it sound like every concern gets thrown out the window by some crazy judge if you deny a developer's plan for any reason.  Come on.

Also, the lack of affordable housing might be partially caused by the relatively recent influx of corporate buyers of single-family homes.  No mention of toning that down.
This is wrong on so many levels. It‚Äôs opening the door for the rest of our forests to be built on.
Shows the absurdity of the affordable housing laws, in place like West Orange where there is no viable space. 

130 non-affordable units were turned down 30+ years ago for various reasons, but now 500+ units are being approved because of how stringent the affordable housing laws are.
ok but Devil‚Äôs advocate here, what about housing for the ever-shrinking middle class?
Where in WO is this? I can think of a few areas (from 20 years ago)‚Ä¶
My wife is on her way to a town planning board meeting where people are trying to fight a 500 unit development being put in our town. She just doesn't want to see the grammar school our kids go to have 100 more kids in it as class sizes are already on the bigger side.
I live here. The mudslides will be imminently coming. In another part of West Orange along Northfield Ave, an apartment building was destroyed from one not long ago. This is a preventable nightmare

I‚Äôm so mad that I didn‚Äôt move more west*. I didn‚Äôt know this place was turning into queens.
green space kinda a lot more important than another dumpy low income project

west orange doesn't have a shortage of dumpy lots that can be built over anyway, this is dumb
Is there a petition or anything we can do about this?!¬†
Only 20% slated for low ""and medium"" cost housing?? How is this helping anyone except the top, again.
Is this a done deal? Absolutely f‚Äôing despicable
Hi everyone,

I am looking to rent back in North NJ. It seems pretty near impossible to find a 1-bedroom for less than 2k a month. Every single town has been required for the past \~5 years or so to have affordable housing at this point? Why hasn't overall pricing decreased? Or will the argument be ""affordable housing mandates stopped rents from being higher?"" How can that be proven?
This isn't directly related to the OP but it always makes me laugh seeing everyone cram into north Jersey when the south has acres and acres of land ripe for building. Imagine if this state actually had good rail systems and public transit so we could build up around those areas instead of shoving everyone into one spot. Maybe in 100 years when we're all dead.
This has been an ongoing issue for over 20 years and the local towns lost the court case

Not sure there is anything that can stop this
1. It‚Äôs a patch of grass (less than a 100 years old as that part of the state lost all of its trees during the Industrial Revolution)

2. It‚Äôs west orange not sequoia national park. If you want trees drive 30 minutes north to Vernon. 

3. we need housing ASAP, all types of housing.
When it comes to housing the NIMBY ego suddenly wakes up. 

Remember!!  wherever you are living‚Äî-

‚Äî was forest at some point in time.

‚Äî was not having electricity, drainage at some point in time

‚Äî was not having tab water at some in time

‚Äî was not having high school at some point in time

‚Äî was not having middle school

‚Äî was not having the roads you see today

‚Äî was not having offices, retails, services etc you see today

Just because you living there cannot be the reason no one else should build there because you fear your property values goes down.
Such a misleading title. We desperately need housing. Nothing but a NIMBY article. I hope they build it, we need housing, we need units.
Amid environmental concerns, this subreddit also promotes Tesla protests.
NIMBYs are so entitled they trespass and treat it like their own private park. Tough luck.
New Jersey desperately needs regional planning to encourage smart growth, especially around train stations and other areas well-served by public transit. 

Building upward instead of outward is the only way to preserve open space and stop suburban sprawl ‚Äî and all the traffic congestion and flooding issues that sprawl creates. 

But that‚Äôs easier said than done. There‚Äôs a reason New Jersey has so many municipalities ‚Äî they all want to maintain local control over their own planning and zoning. The state‚Äôs culture of home rule is the single biggest roadblock to any type of meaningful regional planning. It‚Äôll take a lot of political courage from the governor all the way down.
You say this, but in West Orange, where exactly, where you won't need to eminent domain something and go through that whole process (which will also have its detractors).

This is part of the problem with how the state is enforcing the affordable housing mandate, especially in older north jersey towns that are already highly developed and green space, or even just available space, is hard to come by as is.

People love to jump on Milburn and what it is fighting, but its the same concept. You can't expect to just say, ""you need to have X number of affordable houses, or else"" and say ""well you figure it out then"" when places don't have a good place to stick them, or a current unrelated project doesn't include them in a space where they don't make sense, either economically or from an infrastructure standpoint.
Any time something is actually being built, people find a reason to argue against it. If it weren‚Äôt a forest, it would be a historic parking lot, or an Indian burial ground, or too tall, or too expensive (gentrifying), or too affordable (crime), or disruptive to traffic, or too much noise. 

Just let people build housing so people can afford to live here.
Marlboro just stopped like 500 homes from going up and designated it as green space somehow.
Hop in your car and drive fucking 20 minutes north to Sussex/passaic you‚Äôll see unlimited green space, what are you talking about
Yeah, that's going over well so far.
[deleted]
No, that‚Äôs also not the answer.
Has there been any corporate buy ups of single family homes in West Orange? From my understanding that is not common in this part of the country.
About 450 units were just built in the same town less than a mile from this development in an old office park. There has been other buildings going up too. It's not like development was frozen for 30 years.
all of those numbers are only attainable if you completely destroy the density and culture of existing neighborhoods, it's all way too aggressive
Up not out.
Abutting Verona and the golf course in Roseland off eagle rock
I hope that they are able to stop it. And good on your wife for getting involved.
I live here too.  It's not just environmental issues that are the problem.  The school district is already overcrowded and kids in the elementary schools are being bussed all over town into overcrowded classrooms.  On top of that we already have one of the highest tax rates in the state as this town has done a terrible job of attracting and retaining businesses, so it's the homeowners that bear all the tax burden.  Main St. is an embarrassment with all the liquor stores and fast food joints, and you know things are bad when even a Walgreens shuts down.
Damn, that hit right in the feels. I know how Queens is packed as hell üò≠
No. If you live in the area, attend the town meetings. Never underestimate the power of voices raised together
What you‚Äôre describing is worse for the environment. 

From an environmental perspective, it‚Äôs better to leave those huge swaths of undeveloped land untouched and to build up in areas that are already populated via infill development and upzoning near transit hubs.
You know they're talking about this [entire tract](https://imgur.com/a/Ut2Mrje), right? It's not a patch of grass.
What we really need is less people
No NIMBY is why this is happening lol. Instead of building on vacant lots and upzoning SFH they want the apartment complex far away on a hill¬†
We should be upzoning single family zones and allowing larger buildings, this isn't a real solution¬†
About that... https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/3/24058476/tesla-hazardous-waste-suit-settlement-california
I mean, there‚Äôs tons of empty lots in AC. One is a whole block. 

I know it‚Äôs AC. And I‚Äôm not sure how much one of the lots would cost. Plus, there‚Äôs only so many jobs on the island and limited room). Usually have to go inland for a job. 

Could help the city.
Lmao. What a bunch of bullshit you just posted. You don't clear cut forest and destroy what little green spaces left to cement it over. There's a way to have housing and beautiful forest and open space people like you just want to make it look like fucking Carteret.
Forest is much more important than more housing, sorry. Like the other person said, there‚Äôs plenty of space that doesn‚Äôt require tearing down what little forests we have left.
Forest is way more important then any of the bs you mentioned¬†
Okay. There‚Äôs plenty of space for more housing that doesn‚Äôt involve tearing down forests.
There is also a shit load of space in Nebraska‚Ä¶..
all those things are way more important than stuffing more people here, let alone a crappy low income unit
How about we build tall and dense on already developed land? Plenty of vacant land and parking lots
I‚Äôm with you! Fuck the environment! üëä
Your right don‚Äôt listen to the down votes, the hilarious thing is this ‚Äúforest‚Äù is most likely less than a 100 years old. All the trees in that area of Jersey were cut down in the 1800s. It‚Äôs just a patch of grass in the most industrial part of the state, not like your wiping out a state park LOL
Exactly. Lambertville is facing the same issue.
See how long that lasts. Morris has been cutting down everything in sight over the last five years, and Warren has been putting up shipping facilities on every piece of open farmland they can find. Look further down the road than five minutes.
For now.
FFS, a few historic areas are fine, insisting on preserving SFH exclusive zoning throughout most of the state, in a housing crisis in the most densely populated metro area in the country is absurd.
It's 1000x better then destroying forests, grow up
Yes it is, just upsets the SFH fetish community
Have there been *any*?  Like you're questioning if there's even been *one*?  Essex County is solidly in the middle of the institutional home buying market in NJ, and there's lots of institutional home buying in ""this part of the country,""  with 12-24% of NJ markets going to corporate buyers.

[Institutional Homeownership in NJ](https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dhcr/publications/docs/Institutional_Homeownership_Report_FINAL.pdf)
agreed
Oh yeah when I thinking somewhere on top of ridge that faces NY aka prospect‚Ä¶ that tract is Tucked back in northwest corner
I am not advocating for suburban sprawl. I am talking about rehabbing and finishing central hubs down here that have been left to rot. For example, [this](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.4922542,-75.0361226,3a,75y,343.4h,81.44t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sWaNDW18YkAIDM1VkVOC-_A!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D8.556802681511215%26panoid%3DWaNDW18YkAIDM1VkVOC-_A%26yaw%3D343.40203022270646!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMxMi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) lot.
That is not a forest. Wawayanda state park is forest. That‚Äôs some dudes back yard
That‚Äôs the point. If they did what you ask, how many will oppose that. I say vast majority.

No one has solutions. Most only have objections.
Developing undeveloped land isn‚Äôt a solution?
What about all the vacant housing built throughout NJ over the last decade or two that‚Äôs just been sitting there with nobody living in it for years? Seems people are so willing to justify new development when we haven‚Äôt even found a use for the development we currently have ü§î
It‚Äôs not a forest! Its a patch of trees in west orange!
Yeah you silly af dawg. I hate nimbys too but this ain‚Äôt it.
*was agreeing with you Stephan, I disagreed with the other guy. :(
Have you actually visited the site? I have, and it's a mature forest. Aerial maps from 1930 show it fully covered in trees, but even a 100-year-old forest has a lot of ecological value.
They might not be old growth trees, but it's definitely not a patch of grass.
Just paving over it.
I‚Äôve lived in this area my entire life and you sir are completely wrong. There‚Äôs a difference between someone taking away green space and building on some guys old farm. I haven‚Äôt seen it in Sussex or Morris, if anything more land was placed under the green acres program
Exactly
It‚Äôs a fetish to not want to share a wall with a neighbor?
Yimbys rarely have yards
You got me, I was using ""any"" colloquially, not literally, but thanks for the link! 

Scanning through, the map on page 14 is broken down by city, West Orange is in the lowest color block; 0-5.6%.

Any Essex county numbers will be heavily skewed to Newark, and as the report says (and the map shows), ""Distressed¬†neighborhoods¬†within¬†urbanized¬†communities¬†tend¬†to¬†have¬†very¬†high¬†institutional¬†homeownership¬†shares.¬†Distressed¬†cities¬†tend¬†to¬†experience¬†the¬†greatest¬†rises¬†in¬†institutional¬†homeownership.¬†""

So it does happen in this part of the country, but it's not evenly spread. The town that this development is going on does not seem to have high institutional ownership.
Eagle rock reservation? Yeah that's next lol

In all seriousness though thr article says that tract is already owned by that family, which.... seems crazy to me, but Eagle rock reservation is a county or state owned property, like South Mountain reservation
Ah, I see what you mean. So basically infill development?

Ironically, I think you could use that term to describe this proposal in West Orange. That wooded property doesn‚Äôt appear to be old growth forest. There is very little old growth forest left in NJ, especially in this part of the state. 

The property was likely harvested at some point and then the trees regrew while its owners banked the land.
Is ""not looking like Wawayanda"" the cutoff for land that should be clearcut? Got any citations for that?
Patches of trees help keep temperatures down, keep wildlife away from houses, keep noise down, provide a little bit of escape from this crazy life we live. We don‚Äôt need more housing in the state, we need the state to be affordable. 

The problem is not the number of homes,
It‚Äôs the number of homes people can afford
I said the solution, upzoning. They could chop down every tree in the state and build SFH still wouldn't be affordable. Higher density is the only solution
No it's not, that's what's been happening for 50 years and everything is still expensive. Increasing density is the only real solution.
A 120 acre patch of trees.
I.e. [a forest.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forest)
what‚Äôs the difference between a forest and a patch of trees?
Yes it is, can't hide from reality
Haha word internet makes.it hard to tell sometimes
it doesn‚Äôt as it‚Äôs only 125 acres‚Ä¶
It's at least 95 years old: historical aerials show it covered in trees in 1930.
125 acres is literally nothing. For context cheesequake state park which is pretty tiny is 1610 acres.
Mount Arlington, Roxbury, Hackettstown, Mount Olive, Hanover, and Denville are prime examples.  Drive down Rt 10 and tell me they aren‚Äôt clear cutting enormous tracks of land. An entire area that was forest outside the ITC in Mount Olive is now shipping facilities. Those projects are from the last two years alone.
No it‚Äôs not these people can‚Äôt help themselves
It's fine to want something for yourself but it's a whole other matter to get the government to make it illegal for landowners to build what they want on their own property. I don't know if I'd bring the word fetish into this though.
Yes.
I do, grow up
Sorry are you saying that housing prices in West Orange are not increasing like everywhere else because of the increase in institutional buying?   Because that‚Äôs what it sounds like you‚Äôre saying.  The actual % of institutional ownership is irrelevant if West Orange prices match comp prices, and comp prices are affected by institutional buying.  Sellers and real estate agents price houses at comp levels.
I‚Äôm with you, I‚Äôm surprised that at least part of that property is privately owned. There‚Äôs great hiking and mountain biking trails in there. So aside from the environmental impact, there would be a recreational impact. The state really needs to find a way of coming up with money to buy properties like this.
That whole ridgeline has misc plots‚Ä¶ for instance, there used to be the large one behind the S club that is now SHP fields, idk what tracts are part of what.
>Ah, I see what you mean. So basically infill development?

Pretty much yeah. I think there's been a push to redevelop brownfields too. I'm not sure how far along that is though, or where they're even at.
man you‚Äôll do anything to prevent blacks from moving in your neighborhood. If i can walk across it in less than an hour it‚Äôs fair game for development.
I agree with you but again majority won‚Äôt. We need dense cities with good public transport.
This would increase density. They want to build 500 apartments. Did you even read the article?
something like the Newark watershed, this is way too small to be considered a Forest. If it‚Äôs small enough to fit on a dudes farm it‚Äôs not a Forest
I was agreeing with you lol
The world is huge, it's all relstive. 125 acres in a city isn't tiny.
I guarantee you a vast majority of those tracts were formal industrial sites, ie old mines. Just because you‚Äôre seeing green go away doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre cutting down protected land. The state has protected an enormous amount in the last 30 years through green acres.
I know it‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs close to the real answer though. We gotta build urban areas up higher.

We need the ecosystem services forests and other natural areas provide.
And just saying ""you own this land"" doesn't give you rights to do whatever you want to. Places are zoned the way they are for reasons, and towns master plans are built with that in mind, and expect long term consistency with how they are applied. Thats why seemingly minor variances require the effort that they do, there is a cascading effect on all of that throughout city services, precedent set, etc.
Do comps usually extend that far geographically, like all the way to Newark? I thought it was supposed to be somewhat local.
The property in question in the article is not abutting Eagle Rock. It‚Äôs the wooded area to the north of the West Essex Highlands condo development.
what the actual fuck. bag of dicks for you, weirdo
Up not out, this isn't increasing density it's expanding outwards. Sounds like you don't understand the basic concept of density
Sounds like he didn't.
You are showing everyone that you‚Äôre stunningly ignorant, if you honestly think that. You do know that a lot of farms/ranches can be over 1000 acres, some even hundreds of thousands of acres and 1000+ square miles, right? Largest farm in the US is over 800,000 acres or 1,250 square miles, or 1/3 the size of Yellowstone National Park

Sure, this one wasn‚Äôt that big, but neither is New Jersey. And we don‚Äôt really have that many trees left in most of Jersey, despite what some seem to think.
My bad brother lol
Its not big enough for environmental concerns as the trees definitely didn‚Äôt exist in the preceding century.
Old mines?! Considering our current situation on route 80 I‚Äôm hoping we don‚Äôt repeat that but with buildings in a couple decades. üò¨
>Places are zoned the way they are for reasons, and towns master plans are built with that in mind, 

If we want to get into the history of why the zoning was put into place in the first place it's not great. Most single family zoning was put into place during the era of white flight and red lining. It's easier to segregate a lower density neighborhood than a high density one. There's also less social interaction between people in nearby neighborhoods if everyone is driving everywhere because things are too far to walk to.
Ok housing prices have risen dramatically and I said it‚Äôs partially due to increased corporate ownership.  Those are pretty uncontroversial things to say and I invite you to continue your research of these topics in my absence.
It's the closest road I could think of to say between Verona and [blank].
Atleast I don‚Äôt mind colored folk moving next door, unlike yourself
They are apartments not single family housing.
Are you serious? Have you traveled in the state?
No worries King! Hope you‚Äôre having a good day!
Not sure you're right, historical aerials show it covered in trees as far back as 1930, at least.
lol let‚Äôs hope they‚Äôre more careful!
I literally have a wonderful African American family next door to me. you can go fuck yourself now
Yes, I‚Äôve been to northern and western Jersey, including the densely forested areas. That‚Äôs not a lot of trees in the grand scheme of things. I‚Äôm originally from Texas. Did you know 2 or 3 of even the smaller counties from Texas would be bigger than all of New Jersey? Considering how small New Jersey is, you‚Äôd think you‚Äôd wanna keep any trees you can. Anyone thinking otherwise is extremely naive."
Meeting people - Essex County,Hi all - we moved to Essex County from another state several years ago. I have an elementary age child.

I‚Äôm wondering the same thing. I guess a meetup group of some sort? I‚Äôve thought  about going to one of the theme nights The Find Grind coffee shop in Little Falls (trivia, coloring, board games, live music) but that seems like more of a college-age crowd.

I don't think it's an Essex County thing as much as it is a generational thing. I'm from Essex County around the same age range and my friends group, as well as others I know just don't make time for each other anymore. I know when I was younger all the parents would hang out with friends and family mid week for cake and coffee all the time. I think not being able to survive, let alone thrive on a 40 hour week anymore has just shaped the way we live our lives. Add in everyone living through a screen most of their days and this is the result.

Ironically, it's usually parents through their kids is what seems to get people our age together at all anymore. I would say just get involved more in what kids are into these days and I'm sure you'll meet some cool parents.

‚ÄúSorry, I was on-top of Cherry Hill‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, now, why are you ALSO late to class?‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, Im Cherry Hill‚Äù

As a person living in Mount Laurel, when someone asks where it is, I reply with, not far from Cherry Hill and many know where that is.

As a kid, we went to Cherry Hill mall and Moorestown malls, a lot. I remember feeding the ducks in Moorestown Mall.

Hackensack and Eatontown both have Dahmer vibes in those names
I like the Glens.

The Ridge, The Rock, & The Gardner.
Can‚Äôt decide between Mahwah or Rahway ‚Ä¶
I used to work down the road from Manunka Chunk, like halfway between there and Buttzville. Nobody from out of the area believed either of those places existed.

I also found out that it is possible, with two (or three?) changes of train, to go from Passaic to Wassaic.
Hackensack, such an NJ vibe
Camden.  You take  a ferry ,see a concert and come home

Dicktown in Gloucester township. This shows up in Google maps if you don‚Äôt believe me.
Netcong‚Ä¶reminds of Donkey Kong

Moonachie - I like to mispronounce it as Moon-och-ee.
When I 1st moved to Metuchen from Brooklyn, my son, who was 8 at the time, joked, ""Me Tuchen You.""
Hohokus
Mt. Misery

I've been seeing that sign for Mt. Misery as you're heading west on Rt.70 for as long as I can remember and for just as long I've been telling myself that one day I'm going to make that left and go check the place out. That day hasn't come yet.

Nestled between Erial and Winslow is a small area named Dicktown.

Gotta love the brashness.
Chews Landing
Ho ho kus
Cox Corner which is right near Imlaystown, Ironically
Dunellen. 
Legend says that the railroad master who founded the town had a  sweetheart named Ellen, so he dedicated to her the train station and the town that was built around it, commemorating her name in the name of the new town:  Done for Ellen - Dunellen.
Brick City babyyyyy!!!!
Forked River is hilarious just because of the pronunciation.

Ho-Ho-Kus is just fun to say

Beach Haven though takes the cake for me as just a beautiful beach town name.

Side note can we rename 1 of the 3 Washington Townships in this state to literally anything else?
Neptune is pretty unique
Red Lion
Watchung. Why is it so funky.
Manalapan. If you know how to say it, it rolls off your tongue

My family sometimes jokes about our nicknames for towns. Let‚Äôs see if anyone can guess where any of these are: Raging wood, Mild burn, Slum it, broccoli hurts, hurried mill, and nork. My favorite is probably ‚Äúsnort pills‚Äù.
Lolol! Agreed!! Was about to post it, too.  

Wickatunk.
Trentun
brielle I like a song called Brielle
Song by Sky Sailing
Not really a town but, Ongs Hat
Been a while since I was there, but I'm guessing Bogota still isn't a great place to pick up a load of cocaine.
Hopatcong and Pohatcong are fun to say
Boonton because I always thought it sounded like the boonies growing up
I think people do actually live there, too
This state has so many bizarro street and town references it's not funny 
 Number one?  Haddonfield, Halloween, Michael Myers
I definitely love Helmetta as a town name.. Can tell people to go to Hell(metta) ü§£

Morristown
Why was Popeye mad at the pope? Because he went to Mount Olive.
Manalapan

Or ""Man a lap in"" if im feeling cheeky lol
Blue Ball or Coxstown purely for the funny name.

Other than that I don‚Äôt really have a favorite city. I really enjoy Montclair.
The magical city of Elberon! Sounds like something out of Lord of the Rings. Me and my friend thought so coming home drunk on the train!
Me touching ""Metuchen""
There‚Äôs a town in TN named Strawberry Plains. Love it for the same reason you love Cherry Hill lol¬†
Let‚Äôs talk about the one I dislike which is west New York because as someone who works in New York, everyone gets confused and always say ‚Äúwest New York? Isn‚Äôt it in Jersey?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs just the name‚Äù

Glen Gardner‚Ä¶not too many people know where that town is.
I love to hate Forked River.
Although it's gone, Ong's Hat will always be my favorite.
Parsippany. Kind of rolls off the tongue. 

I recently learned of a town called White and I need to do a deep dive into the history of that one. How am I a 65-year-old native in the state and I‚Äôm still learning about new towns?? 

God, I love my home state.
Dunellen
Edison. Proud to be from it and it's a melting pot.
Hopatcong makes me laugh

Bogota, because everyone not from here pronounces it like Bogota, Colombia!
I like Ho-Ho-Kus
Dunellen
The answer is Ho-Ho-Kus

Leeds Point, but that's just because I think we should have more pride in our state cryptid

Ho-ho-kus‚Ä¶.very Halloween
Cinnaminson!! Sounds so cute and tasty üòä
Shellpile
Cinnaminson. I just like the sound of it. Makes me think of warm cinnamon buns. ü•∞
Also, Frenchtown. Sounds so charming.
I bet the dude that named Bellmawr and Belmar had two sons named Geoff and Jeff.
West New York just has a certain identity crisis about the name.
Cinnaminson. I always kick my leg when I hear it. Can‚Äôt help it. Won‚Äôt help it.
Garfield ü§£
Allamuchy.
Ho Ho Kus.
Moonachie.  I have been saying it wrong for years, but it's so much fun to say wrong!
It‚Äôs gotta be Buttzville
Scotch Plains or Moonachie
Buttzville. Go for Hot Dog Johnny‚Äôs
Shamong
Voorhees
Harvey Cedars
Wildwood
Ho Ho Kus
i like the amount of south jersey people here and i present Minotola, Othello, and Waterford Works. Allaire in Monmouth County sounds cool too.

slightly off topic, ‚ÄúYe Greate Street‚Äù runs through Othello. Amazing name for a road
Washington. Real ones know
Ho-Ho-Kus
Or Seacusus, but only the way the NJT conductors pronounce over the PA
Metuchen for the laughs
Ho-Ho-Kus
Terms of city I love Union City a small urban area in Hudson County. Great food and culture. 

I also fell in love with Flemington in Hunterdon County recently. Not sure what area of the town I was but the landscape in front of me was amazing. I couldn‚Äôt believe I was in NJ lol.
Haddonfield‚Ä¶ home of Michael Myers üî™ (even though they say it‚Äôs in Illinois)
One of my favorite places - Ship Bottom
I'm so happy that Iselin doesn't have a single vote.
Egg Harbor. Where they harbor eggs 

Also Weequahic, cause it‚Äôs fun to say
Alpha.  Sounds like me deep into Civilization video game. After I‚Äôve done Lennongrad and McCartneygrad
Ho-Ho-Kus. Makes me want to hang my stocking and eat some cookies!
When I moved to NJ I found Wickatunk to be very fun to say. Ok I still find it fun to say.
Tuckahoe!!
The name Brielle is beautiful! Wonder where it comes from?
Ho- Ho- Kus.......
I‚Äôve always loved Ho-Ho-Kus
Fort Ree
I‚Äôm a big fan of Nyack. Like I just imagine someone was too lazy to come up with a real name for the town and just decide to say ‚ÄúNew York‚Äù really fast.
National Park
Probably Hightstown because the story of how it got the name is kinda haunting to me
I'm annoyed I've never realized this.
I never forget this news article from 2019:

[Brick Man Admits Dumping Toms River Woman‚Äôs Body In Wall](https://patch.com/new-jersey/brick/brick-man-admits-dumping-toms-river-womans-body-wall)
And if there were two towns named Brick they would be another Brick in the Wall. 

I‚Äôll see myself out‚Ä¶.
i always get them confused because of this! name and proximity are too close for my one braincell to wrap around üò≠
My dads from wall, when I was a kid and we were driving through brick I said ‚Äúoh dad isn‚Äôt this where you grew up?‚Äù He‚Äôs like ‚Äúno that‚Äôs wall, wait a second I never realized this before‚Äù
In North Carolina, Climax and Intercourse are next to each other
This is my fun fact I tell to people who live out of state or in other countries. I live in Wall and work in Brick. One of our yearbooks actually had a joke about not being just another brick in wall‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know if I still have that one lol. Might be 2014 so it would be my brothers.
Was there ever a town called Brickwall that just decided to become 2 separate municipalities at some point in the past?
Omfg I cannot believe I did not realize this until now lmao
It was named after a ship wreck in 1817. A woman was rescued by cutting through the bottom of a capsized ship.
Came here to say Cheesequake!
And Fork-ed River
So this is, invariably, going to the top because I've lived in NJ my entire life and heard every different pronunciation.  My favorite, hands down, was my friend's when we went to AC: ""Cheese-quake Fueden!""  Yeah, like an earthquake of cheese, but then he always added ""Fueden"" was him just trying to combine ""Food and Fuel"".  Jimmy was special, I hope he still is.
Mmmm, Cheesequake
I'll never forget years ago seeing REM at PNC Arts Center, and Michael Stipe kept bringing up that he had just learned there was a place called Cheesequake nearby and now he was obsessed and needed to visit. I often wonder if he ever got there.
My cousin's daughter called is Chess-Ah-Quac-ƒí.  It was hilarious
Are you living on a prayer?
I've never heard of this!
One of my fav spots!!!
Don‚Äôt forget North Bergen‚Ä¶ in Hudson County.
My mom grew up in West New York and it's so funny hearing her explain to outsiders that she is, in fact, from New Jersey.
Those miserable Sackville-Bagginses live in Peapack
I have family in WNYNJ that I looked up on ancestry... like 400+ years (maybe 600) of NJ lineage.  Hundreds of years ancestry on the west side of the Hudson!
Basking Ridge, too!

That part of the state is just a pocket of white, protestant, educated, generationally wealthy folks. There‚Äôs a lot of folks in horse country/golf club country that have named their properties like they are English estates.

Somerset, Middlesex, Bedminster, Oldwick (Old Wick), Chester, Fairmount, Pottersville, Glen Gardner, Hampton, Stirling, Tewksbury, etc. are all named after UK places or placename traditions. A lot of taverns and inns in those parts, too.
I like your brain

My fantasy was to open a gay bar in Buttzville, with a big sign, ample parking in rear.  Imagine the kerfuffle that would cause.

Not that there's anything wrong with that.
There is literally no other option worth entertaining. 

Even how it is spelled with a 'z' like it was some novelty 80's hiphop album is just *chef's kiss*.
Great hotdogs in Buttzville
Every time I drive through Flemington and see the Buttzville sign I chortle.
Buttzville hands down!
Technically not really a town, but it does have a good name. It is part of White township.
Add Southampton and Tabernacle....a trifecta. Beautiful towns as well.
Came here to say this.

First heard of it in some sort of Buzzfeed quiz: ‚ÄúIs it the name of a New Jersey town or a Pok√©mon?‚Äù

It was the only one I got wrong.
Ong‚Äôs hat goes pretty hard.
And there are 5 Washingtons in NJ. There were 6 until the Mercer Co one changed to Robbinsville.
Of Anaheim
the department if the redundancy department
Ugh ok - I live in Washington township. There are 49 of them
Isn‚Äôt the one in South Jersey just called ‚ÄúTownship‚Äù by locals? I used to work there and I had to ask which township they were speaking of the first time.
I always love the Somerset section of Franklin Township in Somerset County. Like ‚Ä¶ Jesus, people, you have endless options.
piss scat away
My wife who‚Äôs from Atlanta pronounced it piss-acaw-taw-whey and had me rolling in laughter
If I want to make my wife laugh, I just refer to Piscataway as Piss the Cat away.
They are based on the once booming oyster industry along the Delaware Bay.
but they smell so wonderful ;p
Beat me to it! I had an older colleague who liked to look at house listings in those towns on his lunch breaks. He had this weird fantasy of buying like half the town. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
muhNALuhpin
I grew up in that area, how else do you say manalapan? It's spelled out how you say it.
Man-a-lappin.  Imagine my teenage brain processing that one.
You mean (with a nasal emphasis) ma-n a lappin
grew up there. the automated voicemail from THE HIGH SCHOOL even said it the mispronounced way.
I've always enjoyed typing out ""Manalapan"" because it has such a rhythm with every other letter being an ""a""
Home of Merv Griffin and ""Califon Productions"" for Jeopardy fans
I called Ho-Ho-Kus ""Santa's hometown"" when I was a kid, and maybe sometimes as an adult in my head still.
Fun fact: ‚ÄúKus‚Äù in Hebrew is a slang term for a woman‚Äôs genitalia. When my Israeli friend first heard the name ‚ÄúHo Ho Kus‚Äù he couldn‚Äôt stop laughing.

Also, whatever PR team rebranded Hackensack as ‚ÄúThe Sac‚Äù needs a good kicking.
Doing shrooms in college and some guy says he‚Äôs from Ho-Ho-Kus. My roommate just out of the blue says HO HO KUS, PO PO KUS waving an imaginary wand. I laughed so hard I couldn‚Äôt breathe.
When I first moved to NYC, and drove through that area I thought someone had defaced a road sign.
Yes! Came here for Ho-Ho-Kus. When I was first moving out my mon suggested moving there and I thought she was bullshitting me.
My favorite! Why did I have to scroll this far to find it .![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
Really disappointed how long I needed to scroll to find National Park. There‚Äôs not even a National Park there!!!
Always makes me think of West Egg, from Great Gatsby.
The harbor of eggs!
Imagine if there was someone traveling the Reading Railroad to Forked River?
It is pronounced Four-kid? Right?
How is it pronounced?
And the exit sign actually says ""The Oranges""
I saw a tv show or movie recently that referenced North Orange like it was a real thing and it pissed me off so bad, I wish I could remember what it was
Lived there for 10 years. Best place to be if you commute to NYC.
Here today, gone to Mahwah
I think of ""Wah-Wah"" by George Harrison
Jesus... I've worked there and this is an amazing take on Mahwah!  100% accurate as well!
The meeting place!
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£.
Shame there is no Wawa in mahwah
Rude üòÇ I grew up in Mahwah so heard it all. The best was when people tried to pronounce the ‚ÄòH‚Äôs : ‚ÄúMaha Waha‚Äù. We also used to call it Hawham as kids.
Literally the first town that came in mind
I always [provide this link when Moonachie comes up](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Moonaki). Greek friends always laughed at the name when it came up.
Yes! I grew up in Moonachie‚Ä¶ it was seriously my whole life
Right after Hurricane Sandy, it was a daily occurrence üòÇ
I mean it kinda is when you have morey's piers lol
Pulled up to the scene with my cinnaminson!
My fave to say out loud for sure.
That‚Äôs a great one
Oops... I just responded that. I've never been there but the name makes me think of warm cinnamon buns.
Too bad it ain‚Äôt.
In a similar vein, Rose City! Sounds like a town in a Pokemon game
Ha!  Never thought I'd see this on reddit!!  Two square blocks and you're through it!
I grew up there and went to high school when 300 came out, and that made things much more fun.
And you can just hear the guy from 300 say it.
![gif](giphy|3o7TKGMslz2YfhkuwU|downsized)
Was a junior in Sparta highschool when that came out... Great times.
![gif](giphy|3o7TKGMslz2YfhkuwU|downsized)
We also have Hopewell!
When I was a little kid, every time my father would say he had to go to Secaucus, I‚Äôd ask who Caucus was. I had no idea it was a town and not a person he was going to see, and my parents didn‚Äôt seem to care to clue me in. 

I also used to ask my mother if we could get a car pet every time we passed the carpet store. So I might not have been that smart of a kid.
We know who is a longtime resident and who isn't by how they pronounce our town name. It means ""land of snakes.""
I mean I‚Äôve heard nj transit train conductors pronounce it SEE-caucus and it always cracks me up. Cus I know it‚Äôs suh-caucus
Ah hee hee!
It sounds like one of those filler words Michael Jackson used. ‚ÄúOwww, shamong, shicka chicka, he he‚Äù
Isn't that the sound Netflix makes when you turn it on?
Huh. I was always under the impression it's pronounced ""Byoona"".
Never knew this existed
Had to read this far to find my neighboring town. But this sub is not much into South Jersey.
Tuckahoe Inn always cracked me up as a kid
Surprised I didn‚Äôt see Succasunna on here sooner. Underrated!
Does to me. I love saying this
That‚Äôs adorable
Named after a native American chief (whose name was actually spelled differently).

Thank you for this gem lmao
i went to the link and then found another with the lyrics and that one had some comments.  thanks for opening my eyes!  haha
I always like saying Allamuchy
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Wanaque and Mahwah are both fun to say too
There‚Äôs a North, East, South, and even a New Brunswick.  But no West Brunswick.   ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
There's also New Milford and Milford, neither of which are close to West Milford.
This one threw me off when I moved here.  I am from SE Virginia, and we have a Dismal Swamp too.
There's no way. Growing up, I always thought it was a boring, common name
I mean it almost literally means boring town
That is a fun fact
You wouldn't believe how freaked out people elsewhere in the country get about ""boro"" being a thing.
Next time, give her a knitted hat and a backpack, and take her to Blairstown )))
Bricktucky always makes me laugh üòÇ
Boonton always trips visitors up. Reminds me of the scene from My Big Fat Greek Wedding where they talk about the ‚Äúboont‚Äù cake üòÇ

Ong‚Äôs hat is one of the best. It has a pretty weird story, I bet.
Where the hell is Ong‚Äôs hat?
Nowhere near Berlin!
Wall.

Surprised I had to scroll so far for Garfield. Loved growing up in this small ass city that shares the name with one of our favorite fat orange cats.
That‚Äôs what the GPS says üòÇ
Not to be confused with Hopatcong
Sounds like a Kurt Vonnegut novel
Called it Ramahoe too lol
Omg. All my life in NJ and I can‚Äôt believe I never heard this!
Yes, but was it Neptune township or Neptune City?  They are next to each other and share the same ZIP code.
lol my cousin lived on this street
I grew up in wanaque
Feeding the ducks was the best!
I guess it‚Äôs more of an unincorporated community.. but still a kick ass name lol
Quick way to tell natives from outsiders
Gorgeous
Oh lord, stuck in Lodi again
Not to be mistaken for Belmawr
Not to be confused with Bellmawr, ofc
‚Ä¶when you can sneeze
Why cough?  Why not!
Reminds me of baskin Robbins
Netcong sounds like a Linux command
Same! It sounds like some little Pok√©mon town : )
will always make me think of the several njt conductors that call it DUH-nellen when announcing the stop.
Ridgewood, Millburn, Summit, Berkeley Heights‚Ä¶.something‚Ä¶Newark, Short Hills.¬†
Got Summit. Newark, and Short Hills, anyway.
The second T is silent.
Is it a town? I know squirrel wood road goes near or through Paterson.
Crud lake
Or Christmas if that‚Äôs your speed
My uncle had a black lab named Nyack when I was really young, fast forward 18 years later when I found out it was a town, mind blown
do you have a source for this? as a resident here, i read it was because john and mary hight, who owned a tavern nearby and owned 3000 acres,  named the town. i never heard what you are saying before.
What‚Äôs the story?
i live in brick and work in wall‚Ä¶ and i also just realized this üò≠
My head just exploded. How did I never notice this?!
Isn‚Äôt there an Edgar Allan Poe story about this?
Best headline ever! ü§£
Never knew this!
Why is everyone lately pluralizing the word woman when speaking about an individual woman, not a group of women?
It can't be anything other than Cheesequake.
Wait, how is Cheesequake actually supposed to be pronounced? I‚Äôve never heard anyone say it out loud ‚Äî I‚Äôve only seen it written, so now I need to know.
At least we‚Äôre halfway there.
LBI beach town. $$$. Between Harvey Cedars ( another great name ) and Barnegat.
To the south of Bergen County.
And East Newark!
I came over from Queens, asked my wife after moving here... She was convinced we lived in Bergen county since we were in North Bergen. The Google Maps look-up was so puzzling, it made no sense at all.
Just like people from Kansas City explaining they're from Missouri and not Kansas.
Makes total sense because East New York is in Brooklyn
PA has a Jersey Shore
Unfortunately don‚Äôt think the locals would be too into it, but would love to be proven wrong
I always wanted to open a gay bar called either ‚ÄúThe Tool Shed‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Male Room‚Äù.  Opening it in Buttzville would be the kicker.
I used to pass by one called ""The Man Hole"" in Chicago years ago. Of course it was located in the neighborhood called ""Boys Town"".

Wild place that city...
HDJ and a good birchbeer.
My favorite place on 46!!
Anyone I‚Äôve met from Buttzville say they‚Äôre from Buttzville and not White Township. It‚Äôs like someone saying they‚Äôre from Queens. It‚Äôs part of NYC. But they identify as being from Queens or Staten Island.
Shanacleton!
Piss cat? Away!

Just gotta visit in the dead of winter! When, you know, it's inhospitable because of the winds howling off the bay, just to mix it up.
I did the same thing and actually followed through with it lol
That‚Äôs the way.
Think MAN‚ÄîA‚Äî-LAP-AN (hard A, like man swimming ‚ÄòA lap‚Äô in the pool).  I hear so many people butcher it, especially other Monmouth county residents.  It‚Äôs mostly the transplants.
I read that as Satan‚Äôs hometown and wondered what they did to make you hate them.
LOL...The Sac.  My thoughts exactly. ""WTF were they thinking?""
I needed a good cackle, thanks for that ü§£
I love the reference to Hackensack in the first Grand Theft Auto, they called it Hackenslash
Omg ü§£ü§£ü§£
It‚Äôs home to red bank battlefield, which is a historically important landmark but not sure why they called it ‚Äúnational‚Äù park
üòÇüòÇ
Four-kid, For-kid. Either or.
Fork-ed if that makes sense. Not good with phonetic spelling. Just looked it up. Dictionary says it's like Forkid.
Similar to signs that say ‚Äúthe Amboys‚Äù. Though there are less Amboys than Oranges.
As someone from South Jersey I get anxious just thinking about it when I remember the first time I had to get off that Parkway exit. I had no idea where I was going, my GPS was rerouting, and nobody was letting me merge.
The X-Files season 2 episode 4, ""Sleepless"" has a scene at a ""VA Medical Center"" in ""North Orange, NJ"". Probably not the only instance but it cracked me up.
I love this ü§£
With Baba Wawa
Among the things my grandma claims to have invented, she said this slogan was coined when her company Meldisco shoes was moving to Mahwah. She had an old shirt with the slogan on it (wish I still had it) but otherwise no proof. Sorry grandma!
I hope one day they will build a Wawa in Mahwah
Yeah define ‚Äúpretty‚Äù
Roselle Park is pretty nice though
Ayyy I was in HS with you I guess

This is correct, grew up there and was supposed to attend Buena Regional.
I was corrected after pronouncing it like the Spanish word it is literally spelled as...Boo nah
If your kid plays soccer in NJ you know allllll about the Tuckahoe Turf Farm, lol
Iirc, it was also pronounced ""Meta-Chin""
LOL, I can‚Äôt tell you friend.

I heard it for the first time 30+ years ago when Vin Scelsa played it on his Idiot‚Äôs Delight radio show on either WNEW or K-Rock.

My first apartment was there. Can confirm

West of the circle where 70 and 72 intersect, at the junction of Magnolia Rd. And Ong's Hat Rd. Pemberton Township. There's not much there anymore, just a cool name.

Yep those are there

Just to let you know, I think you commented on the wrong comment. 

As for the story, one of my high school teachers told me it. I can look for an exact source though, just remind me in a few hours. A little busy rn
The natives named it. The called it Hightstown cause it was in hills. Literally high town. What's haunting to me about it is that the settlers came here, intentionally slaughtered them, and then just kept the name. Kinda makes it a living ghost town in my mind. Just something I think about a lot
All in all you‚Äôve got to‚Ä¶ drive from Brick into Wall

You got an extra $50K to invest?  We can create an LLC and open a place.  Originally I wanted to write ""we could become partners"" but that might raise eyebrows with some of the less accepting people I know.

Sure, but (and I know this is a bit dated) the 2010 census info for the ""town"" counts 146 total people and 58 residential houses. You meet a lot of people from there?
Lol. The best neighborhood group in all of the universe.
This is the actual Native translation
Not the half the town part but almost half a block
I wish I had a better story now hahaha
There's also a reference to Hackensack in an old Donald Duck reel, getting a complaint from the the mayor of Quackensack, NJ
Right, though Red Bank Battlefield would also be a fantastic town name.
Thats a good description!  Forkid!
Yes! That's it. Good memory lol
I've been wishing that for ages!
They won‚Äôt because they already built it in Ramsey -__-

I just know that it‚Äôs definitely a road because the exit always backs up. I spend a lot of time in that area and when I was a kid we went to Paterson constantly because my grandparents lived there.

Too obvious üòÜ
Thank you!
LBI love!! I‚Äôm biased, but I think Loveladies, Beach Haven, High Bar Harbor, Ship Bottom, and Surf City are all great :)
Problem is that Butzville, while having a fun name, wouldn‚Äôt be safe to open a fabulous establishment.   I‚Äôd give it a week before it got burned to the ground.
Totally nothing wrong with it.  I‚Äôm straight, but gay bars are a blast.  I‚Äôve never not had fun hanging out at one.
Details my friend. Do you live there, or rent out the homes?
True, but I believe there‚Äôs a red bank in north Jersey so it would be a bit redundant
Hah, that episode apparently aired over 30 years ago... I wish my memory was that good but I rewatched the first seasons within the last year or two and the random incongruity of ""North Orange"" stuck in my head!
The newly opened Montville Wawa is exactly 1.1 miles from the Parsippany Wawa.
I would say certain beaches are pretty too. Sandy hook and long branch are some of my favorites.
We are talking about the same place. The exit is closed on 80 East rn. Has been for a while now. I always assumed it was like a tiny town right next to Patterson
Update: I've contacted a person who helps track new jerseys history. Most likely, I'm remembering the wrong town. My bad
Yeah
I saw this movie.
I fixed it. It‚Äôs just been a full weekend for me and thought I would share a useless fact that I somehow knew haha. It‚Äôs cool.
Oh, I left that part out. 

We'd have it heavily insured for fire.  Who really want's to work running a bar, any kind of bar?

Dealing with the public, worrying about drunks, paying tributes so certain people can enjoy ""that thing of their's"" and greasing politicians, uhh I mean supporting local candidates. We'd never make a buck.

Like I first wrote, its more of a fantasy than an actual business plan.

That's it, I'm outta here!
Live there. It‚Äôs one house actually and just a large semi wooded lot. Bought it last year 3 bedrooms 1100 sqft paved driveway, decent shape but old people lived there so some things needed serious updates/repair. Septic and roof were good but the roof is from 1990 so it‚Äôs being replaced as we speak. Furnace was oil but I upgraded to gas since the furnace was dying anyway. Lots of paint and some minor floor repair in the bathroom where the toilet tank was leaking fresh water onto the floor and caused the subfloor to rot (not the main floor thank god). Been here for 11 months and honestly enjoy it. Close proximity to shopping in Millville/vineland. The local school is actually pretty great (5 yo son) and low taxes. I pay $3200 annually. No major crime to report and very nice neighbors. If you can stand the occasional green head in the summertime and don‚Äôt mind quiet it‚Äôs totally a viable place to live. I work in cape May court house and it‚Äôs like a 30 minute ride even in the summer.
Oh there very much is, but since when has that stopped us...?
Thanks for letting us know.
Well it's thing I learned in school, and I live pretty close to the intersection of a couple different towns, so I'm not surprised if it got it mixed up. But I'd wanna at least try to correct it
Do you know what town it was?
No, I'll look into it and see if I can find out but today was... not a good research day. But of I can find out (and remember too), I'll let yah know
Thanks!

I have no idea what's going on, but it seemed to even out.
Haven't noticed any increase in prices for my bill
Flawed market dynamics is weird way of saying corporate greed.¬†
I got one of these promos too. The thing is, they do not disclose the price per kw before you sign up, sure they give you the ""credit for community solar generation"" spiel but you never know the rate you're paying. That non disclosure is a deal breaker and honestly scammy
Your bill will tell you exactly what happened. It sounds like you had an estimated reading followed by an actual reading. You know how you get to the bottom of this? Read your bill.
So I did a lot of research into this, the community solar program is not a third party supplier scam type thing. They actually just give you a discount on your bill and your supplier stays the same. You can cancel any time and there are no penalties. The way I understand how they make profit is they get funds from the state to build these solar panels but they are required to help the community for a certain amount of time before using it for full commercial purpose, thus you usually get a 20 year contract."

It's not bad, it's not great, but there's a good half and a bad half. if you're in the historic section, it's a great little community. The problem is the history district is like 4 streets lol the town is small. The biggest issue with the town is that it's poor. And it has the things associated with poverty. A lot of people seem to be buying up the big historic mansions and working from home since you either need to work from home, or commute to make any kind of living there.

"N.J. cannabis fails safety tests, consumer group finds","By

* [Jelani Gibson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com](https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/staff/jgibson/posts.html)

Weed sold at New Jersey dispensaries from 17 cultivators and manufacturers did not meet state safety standards for things such as mold and accurate labeling, according to a consumer advocacy group that teamed up with a lab to test products.

Cannabis products are tested before they reach store shelves. The consumer advocacy group, Safe Leaf ‚Äî worked with an accredited testing lab and re-tested weed sold at dispensaries. The results showed that nearly 30% of tested products failed and exceeded limits for harmful microbes. NJ Advance Media has agreed to grant anonymity to the testing lab.

There were also problems when it came to accurate labeling of THC levels, according to the data. The lab tested 25 pre-rolls from 17 different cultivators and manufacturers. Pre-rolls are cannabis blunts rolled ahead of time and sold to the consumer.

Consumer advocates suspect weed that does not meet state standards is sold to the public because cannabis cultivators and manufacturers can get their products tested at labs they believe are less likely to fail them. It is a practice known as ‚Äúlab shopping.‚Äù

In response, [New Jersey cannabis regulators ](https://www.nj.gov/cannabis/)have revised testing regulations, scheduled town halls on medical cannabis and plan to set up a lab that double checks industry protocols.

‚ÄúHaving this test reference laboratory would help bolster product safety and ensure accurate labeling of reports,‚Äù Cannabis Regulatory Commission chair Dianna Houenou said in a February public meeting.

Before cannabis was sold for recreational use, it was tested by the state, but its labs were simultaneously functioning at the height of COVID. When the market expanded, legislators handed the responsibility over to the private sector.

The state in July issued [a recall](https://www.nj.com/marijuana/2024/07/nj-recalls-weed-product-that-contained-insects-and-human-hair.html) for weed that was contaminated with human hair and insects.

Lab shopping is a national problem, said Chris Goldstein, a regional head of NORML, one of the organizations that advocated for New Jersey‚Äôs cannabis legalization.

‚ÄúLab shopping has been endemic in the industry,‚Äù he said.

Testing controversies have arisen in other states. In New York, lab testing came under scrutiny when products were shown to have inaccurate labeling about how much THC was in a product. A [Syracuse.com](https://www.syracuse.com/marijuana/2023/09/nys-testing-failures-expose-legal-weed-consumers-to-unsafe-cannabis-a-serious-health-threat.html) investigation showed cannabis contained microbial levels 10 to 250 times higher than what‚Äôs allowed under the state‚Äôs rules for medical cannabis.

In March 2025, a judge [sided with Michigan cannabis regulators](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2025/03/03/judge-sides-with-state-cannabis-agency-in-dispute-with-pot-testing-company/81167985007/) after they were sued by one of the state‚Äôs largest cannabis testing labs over a recall. But regulators don‚Äôt always win in court, Goldstein said, pointing to 2022, when [Pennsylvania regulators](https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/business-issues-benchmarks/compliance/news/15692547/pennsylvania-commonwealth-court-judge-overturns-statewide-vape-recall) recalled cannabis products but eventually had to return the products to shelves after losing a legal battle.

The New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission decision to set up a reference lab was a step in the right direction and would insulate them from court challenges, the state decides to go after a company, Goldstein said.

Safe Leaf directors Andrea Raible and Michael Boone said they have plans to expand their initiative. Raible is a medical cannabis user and Boone is a teaching specialist at Stockton University‚Äôs hemp and cannabis program.

Boone said consumer-driven shopper programs complement the market.

‚ÄúWe create another layer of safety, another layer of protection,‚Äù he said.

Consumers should get a role in what a successful market looks like beyond sales numbers, Raible said.

‚ÄúWhile there is untapped financial potential, it (cannabis) also has the potential to help so many people and it can‚Äôt do that unless it‚Äôs clean and trustworthy,‚Äù Raible said.",0.99,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jdlw13/nj_cannabis_fails_safety_tests_consumer_group/,95,1jdlw13,2025-03-17 19:48,"I really just want a list of brands (unless I missed it) to see if I've been smoking moldy trash üòÇ

Where‚Äôs the list of brands?
We need a class action against the state. How are they allowed to sell weed, but we can't grow our own organic, pesticide free marijuana. You're allowed to brew beer and make wine....
Curaleaf is trash
don't smoke prerolls...no benefit in it
And they won't do Jack shit about it! Almost like selling the first licenses to total industry scum was a terrible idea. I bought a batch that may have had human hair in it. The dispensary called and told me I could bring it back in *if I still had the product.* Then I could get a refund, otherwise I was just fucked. So I smoked your nasty ass hair and that's my fault? No replacement, no discount. That company? They just re-branded themselves, still selling to everyone in the state. Cool, so I pay top dollar for weed I need to inspect myself. Hell yeah.¬†¬†


Remember kiddies, home grow is dangerous. Who knows what you could do to yourself. Now, continue buying my pesticide ridden mids please, we wouldn't want Scutari's friends getting any less rich.

I‚Äôve smoked worse to be honest. Nothing like dropping a fresh grinded grinder on a carpet‚Ä¶
Okay occasionally I smell a moldy smell in the weed I buy. It‚Äôs subtle and I‚Äôm just really sensitive to that type of smell and I ignored it because I figured the dispensaries have to make sure üòÇ

I buy different brands, usually whatever is on sale. And it‚Äôs not always. We don‚Äôt even go to the same dispensary all the time bc there‚Äôs like 3 within 5 miles of me. 

This pisses me off because the only real reason I go to the dispensary is because I was fear mongered into thinking there would be cross contamination problems with fentanyl. So we pay more for the reassurance that it‚Äôs completely safe and tested. 

Also am I dumb or like do they really not list the brands???? What‚Äôs the point of telling us if you‚Äôre not even going to say what brands it is.
I used to smoke dirt weed filled with popping seeds in the 80's so mehh
That‚Äôs why we still use our plugs, well that and cheaper prices on quality
Ugh. Please don‚Äôt be Rhythm - Animal Face. 

I was living in SoCal for 8 years‚Ä¶been back in Jersey for 1.5 years and it took almost the entire time back to finally find a strong Indica that hits like SoCal weed. Would be mega disappointed if their product has micro-mold. 

PS. Obviously go after lab shopping, but also‚Ä¶allow customers to inspect the buds at the shop! I absolutely *hate* having to buy a bag blind. Let me see & smell that sht like a gentleman.
https://www.safeleafsociety.com/data-1/project-one-h346n-zrz82 
This looks like they‚Äôre actually going after lab shopping in general, which in my opinion is the biggest issue here. They have a space for anon whistleblowers to submit info on their site. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the names come soon, probably trying not to get ‚Äúoffed‚Äù before they have a chance to test and release more!!!
Thats why we should be allowed to grow our own, but again corrupt legislation and greed win out

there it is
Lol of course the one supposed benefit legal is supposed to have is shit because the govt is collecting fees but not doing any real regulating¬†
Used to work for a group called MPX, which was the concentrates branch of a parent company called iAnthus. I was in Maryland at the time but MPX currently has a multi-state reach, Nj being one of those states (where two of the owners are actually from). Even though I can't say enough about the quality we held ourselves to at the time, I remember going through grow facilities to shop for production material and being disgusted by the grow practices. 

Big point I want to make is this; MPX isn't the only multi-state operator. Many of the same growers we dealt with in Maryland also operate in NJ. Some of those growing practices are still ""alive and well"".
So if you are going to tax and regulate in clean it up but nobody was checking weed safety when I was a teen.
Half the concentrate tastes like mold.
I use to work at grow in North NJ, I would be cautious of flower products
I had several years in the cannabis industry as a retail GM between California and NJ, I got to see the transition from medical to recreational in California, as well as spearheaded the opening of 2 dispensaries in North NJ. 

Back when I ran an NJ dispensary during the med only days, the state only required testing 1 batch of a strain, then from there it was a free for all, no requirements on further testing. And this was for medical!!! I had to take care of patients who got moldy flower, going against the grain of my company who didn't want to handle those issues ethically and morally.

 I toured our NJ grow, and it was a mess. All the worst smells, crappy growing, drying, and ""curing"" techniques, and unsanitary conditions. It was a rush to get the product out, a numbers game, with no mind to quality or safety.

Back when it was only medical, our operation was based on finding the best locations that would do well once recreational came around, it was never about the patients. Ironic that one of the locations, in a very prominent retail heavy area of North NJ, is still only medical and will probably never go rec.

Stark contrast between the NJ grow I toured vs. the grows I toured in California.

Not surprised by this, NJ will be NJ after all. So glad to be out of the corporate cannabis game, all these big multi-state operators hide under the veil of cannabis being a natural, healing plant, but under it all they only care about profit. The industry is a rip off out here, in so many ways.
Fernway better be on there cause they're awful
It‚Äôs weird when humans try to widgetize plant medicine‚Ä¶ almost like you should just let natural things be natural
Shocking /s
Isn't the CRC just about to roll out new testing guidelines tomorrow, mandating expanded cannabinoid profiles (THC, CBD, THCA, CBDA, CBG, etc.) and tighter batch sizes with labs having until May 23, 2025, to fully comply with initial and stability testing changes??

They'll be all over this.

It‚Äôs all moldy trash so yr good
I'm waiting ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
Thing is -- I TRUST my street guy; he always says which farm in city state each comes from, and provides pics and videos of it 1st.   

These NJ dispo's don't have any of the product for anyone to actually view 1st unlike most states where it's been around for a minute.

  I swear the $28 verano ""8ths"" in the 7 pack pre-rolls are 90% stems.  most disappointing shit ever and Verano (as expected) is using it to get rid of the shit that should be tossed in the garbage.
Sounds like Jersey to me!
So true. I won‚Äôt buy anything here simply because we go to Michigan 2-3 times a year for family. They have a fair & competitive market so the prices are waaaaaay below NJ. It‚Äôs bonkers what these crooks charge here
There is a reason why they're pushing a law to target those who buy from their street guy.
if you're not getting twice as high, no reason to pay double the price i always say
That why I went to my old plug. Its cheaper than before it was legal and probably same shit you buy in dispo now that they found out legal weed is moldy too.
Where you getting street prices for less than dispensary? I get an ounce of good stuff for $120 at the store. It's at least $250 from anyone local.
Been trash
Not everyone likes or is able to roll their own
Name the company
So nothing had the list of brands that failed?
Exactly!! If you can let me know of some brands you smelled mold on I would greatly appreciate it!
My guess is whoever it is you won‚Äôt see on the shelf any more
Same and often times shared a joint with strangers at a party or concert.
Same
Name it.
What place is it? I have people who work in the industry and it‚Äôs infuriating how badly run it is. Borderline criminal especially since we‚Äôre thrown in the fire if we grow our own clean weed that‚Äôs 1000% higher quality than this shit.
No way, my homie in AZ was one of the founders of MPX
So true.
Only had to try that trash once to know it was no good
Why? They were one of the first 1/8‚Äôs I bought legally and never again.
This is pretty cool thanks
That‚Äôs the other thing, my street guy knows more about what he‚Äôs selling than the dispo itself! Like you said, he knows where it grows, who is growing it, general percentages. Meanwhile, I walk into Rise and they go ‚ÄúIndica is good for sleeping‚Äù and then stare at you like they ran out of scripted dialogue. 

Even ONLINE, where it should be so easy to show testing information from the lab, frequently just has the name, a made up percentage, and indica/sativa/hybrid designation. Not even an attempt at a description.
Yes. This is 100% true.
Literally how? Are you getting shake? Cannot find anything close to that cheap for buds, the best I found was $150 for an oz of preground (shitty) flower.
I have this cool little machine. It takes a bit of getting used to but I think I paid 8 or 10 bucks for it at my local vape store. It‚Äôs just a little roller and you put the weed in and feed the paper. I could never ever roll my own things but I feel like a pro with my lil joint roller üòé
Worst devils advocate ever. Pre rolls are just shake and trimmings that couldn‚Äôt be sold otherwise. It‚Äôs literally ripping off uneducated consumers.
Not with that attitude!

Go buy some loose cigarette tobacco like Drum and practice.  It's fun.
Lol
The company was named in one of the above linked articles. They sold under Green Joy I believe, not sure if they actually changed their name or not.
Nope. Nebulous.
So the two brands we mostly buy are either ozone or simply good flower bc they‚Äôre always on sale. I think it‚Äôs the simply good I‚Äôve smelled it in if I‚Äôm thinking correctly. Ozone usually comes in a bag and I think the simply good comes in a little pop top and sometimes I‚Äôd pop it and get a whiff.
Lmao I probably trained with him out in AZ ~2018. Those guys were cool as shit
[deleted]
The % never matches what is on the bag.  Sometimes it's close, sometimes it's not.  there are a few people at ZenLeaf(Neptune) and HighProfile(Lakehurst) who are just pure stoners(Mike @ Zenleaf you'd think wandered out of an RV with the smoke following him somewhere in the southwest when he's the budtender/cashier) and actually give you the heads up on what they feel is crap vs quality at least.   The Lakehurst one being a former Burger King I find funny because it continues to thrive as a drive-thru.

My street guy will always be the most reliable though as he posts the weekly Telegram with prices, pics, videos, grower info, etc.  Half of the dispensaries problems are they don't want to display the actual product itself and instead want the buyer to research or take it at the ""bud-tenders"" word of mouth
People smoke weed for arthritis, arthritis fucks up your hands ability to hold small things with any stability. It‚Äôs really not hard to puzzle out why some people might want pre-rolled joints.
Also the little popcorn buds that they sell at a discount, but instead sold at a premium.
Wow, no way! 

For sure, you probably did then. Guy was highly involved in lab operations there around that time.
You can get ounces for $80 online so that‚Äôs a huge rip off charging $100 for a half
A half for a hundred is high for the street what are you saying?
$10 glass bowl from a gas station. Small grinder. Vapes which are easier on the lungs. Joints also burn through weed. There‚Äôs many better alternatives.
Edibles are a thing.
Online where? üëÄ
[deleted]
[deleted]
The people I know smoking pre rolled take 2 hits and put it out. Why take the extra steps of buying a grinder and a bowl, grinding the weed and packing a bowl, potentially taking much stronger hits than intended when they can just buy a joint, take a puff then move on. 

Which again, packing a bowl isn‚Äôt easy when your hands are trembling and can‚Äôt function properly. Pre rolled cones are all around much easier.
Why you gotta write each fraction differently like that and why did it make me irrationally anxious?!
It sounds like you just had really bad people man prices have been under 10 a g for a long time you can get ounces regularly from anyone in north jersey for 150 - a half for 80 - a q for 50 - 8th 25-30
All the people I have dealt with a respectful and always pick up a call you seem to mess with small street dealers
be a friend and roll some joints for them so they don't need to buy some boof packs?
[removed]
I just rather pay less for quality that I actually know where it came from then give my money to dispos that are passing moldy deps to consumers for a premium just because they have a license and a building to legally do it out of lol

other spots might be off some hiking trails and probably aren't the most fun to push a stroller on

you would probably need a fishing license though

Also, check out a place called Fox's Pond; we used to call it Park's Lake, but I think Fox's is the real name. It has a paved walking path around the entire circumference of the lake. It is not huge, but you can kill a few hours easily. Not sure about crappie as I do not fish for them.

I ended up having to show up to one of their on site locations to fix my previous requests. I hadn‚Äôt seen anything for over 2 years.

Some sketchiness that we found on a home and need some advice,"We recently saw a home that we really liked but there was some sketchiness. The home was relisted a few times as well as having multiple owners. That is fine, I know things change and people's circumstances change, but when we asked the seller's agent about why the current owners had listed it a couple of times and then unlisted it. She referred back to the one time in which it was relisted a year ago. When I mentioned that it was actually listed 6 months ago. She gave me a weird look and then said that the owner changed his mind, then added she they had twins so they wanted a bigger home mind you, this home has six bedrooms and five and a half baths. I get it, maybe they wantedt a really really big property with tons of space. Sure I'll buy that.   It was just odd that she forgot that less than 6 months ago she herself was the one that listed the property. Then the next day I go back to Zillow to check just how many times this particular house was listed because I remember it being listed a few additional times with different owners, now all of this information is gone, even the October listing.

You can look on the County Clerk's website.  Deeds are public record.  You can read the vested in verbage to get the book and page of the prior deed, look up that one, read the vested in verbage, look up that one etc

People list and unlist property all the time for various reasons.
Drive around the neighborhood slow enough, and you will be stopped by the noise neighbor...tell them you are interested in buying the house, and they will tell you all the stories about the house...best way to get info about a house or neighborhood is to talk to the self proclaimed neighborhood watch person/protector.
 Get your own local realtor and they will be able to check all of this for you. And I say local because if there is an issue with the property, an out of area realtor may not have the info.
This is all viewable via MLS. Have your agent look it up
Ring the neighbors‚Äô doorbells and ask

What county?
Essex
U could share the listing and people can look into it.
To ensure a smooth home-buying experience, it's crucial to hire a reliable inspector for your inspections and work with a competent lawyer. Their expertise will help uncover everything you need to know about the property. It's important to keep in mind that people's situations and decisions can change when they're looking for a house. I've seen many instances where individuals initially wanted to sell their homes but later decided against it, only to relist the property a couple of months later. This can be quite frustrating, especially after we've moved on, only to find the house back on the market. In total, we viewed nearly 250 houses, and a few had serious issues‚Äîthank goodness for the inspections! It's always better to invest a little upfront than to face significant costs later on.
 How old is the house? It's probably haunted, obviously.
[deleted]
Valid point, but outside of what I mentioned,  it's a great home but I don't know if my uneasiness is valid or could there be something. I haven't encountered anything like this before and also It's a huge purchase and plan for it to be a long term one, so I want to do my due diligence.
THIS is the only way to get accurate info about deeds changing hands. listings mean nothing.
Can confirm- I am the nosy neighbor.
We did ask ours and she couldn't see anything. But we legit had the conversation with the sellers agent so we know it was listed.
She said there's nothing on the MLS. She looked while we were with her. She's also confused how they got it removed and why nothing is showing up. She's a good agent and knows her stuff so I believe her.
These days that's a good way to the the cops called on you or worse.
They are completely moved out. I don't know exactly when they did, was it early last yr or in October or just now. But they are gone gone.
Haha haunted or something else going on!
I did, she only saw what Zillow/Internet is showing.
Also, supply demand is insane here, hence asking. Pre2020 this wouldn't have even been a question, I would have walked.
Eesh...listen, maybe something happened there. All jokes aside...ya never know!! I agree, check with the neighbors. And report back! Haha

Jersey City commute - suburb under 45 min?,"Hi folks, (crossposting this from the Moving to NJ sub since this one seems more active, I hope that's okay!), 

My family's considering a move to NJ and admittedly might be looking for what probably doesn't exist, but I'll throw myself upon your expertise anyway. My husband's job will be in Jersey City (Exchange Place), and we're looking to find a house in a suburb with a good-to-decent public school system, diversity (we're African-American), and a commute that's 45 minutes or less, for $700k to $1.1m. I'm familiar with the typical places that tick some or most of our boxes (West Orange, Maplewood, South Orange) but the commute times are the real struggle - either driving or by train, everything looks to be around an hour if not more. Is there some gem of a town out there that I'm missing?

Thanks in advance for any help!",0.84,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jdk498/jersey_city_commute_suburb_under_45_min/,49,1jdk498,2025-03-17 18:37,"From south orange that‚Äôs totally doable, I used to do that exact commute. I would recommend looking for towns with a train that goes direct to Hoboken so you can light rail or path over to exchange.
Its tough to get a reliable 45 minute commute.  The train is your best best as when driving the distance doesn't matter so much as it can take 45 minutes or more just to drive across JC.  I used to live ~10 miles from JC, moved further out, and my commute only increased by 10-15 minutes, 75% of the commute is just getting through JC. It just doesn't have the infrastructure to support the amount of cars, even with the rebuilt WittPenn and Holland approach.
Second the comment who suggested Montclair area, plenty of really nice adjacent towns that are not as expensive: Verona, Caldwell, Bloomfield, Roseland. 

Used to commute to Exchange place, and can be done in 45 or under. BUT, to achieve that you need to drive to Harrison and take the path to exchange place. Driving all the way there is an hour fifteen because of JC traffic
Take a look at Montclair. It‚Äôs closer to JC than the Oranges and quite diverse.
Exchange place isn't near a highway, and if you have a train commute from a suburb, you're probably looking at transferring to the light rail at Hoboken or the Path at Newark. Not a bad commute, but hard to make it under 45 minutes. If you want something closer but less suburban, look into Weehawken, West New York, or North Bergen.

If you want a suburb and are ok changing trains, look into Bloomfield, Montclair, Rutherford, Westfield, Cranford.
Springfield, in the neighborhood off Morris and Short Hills Ave. The town jitney picks up commuters and drops them off at the Short Hills NJ Transit station.
Union, Springfield
Towns I would look at within these parameters:   
Hackensack   
Rutherford   
Hawthorne   
Clifton  
Montclair   
Paramus   
Riveredge   
Dumont   
Edgewater   
Maywood   
Rochelle Park   
North Caldwell   
Little Falls
Why not move somewhere more central Jersey? The commute from Hamilton to exchange place is only two train stops, NEC njtransit (Newark) and PATH. North Jersey‚Ä¶ is going to be a pain, to travel 4mi it takes me 30mins, with heavy traffic longer. Plus the homes further south you go get cheaper, and they‚Äôre nicer if you want more of a suburb living‚Ä¶
Maplewood resident here, like others have mentioned, Maplewood\\South Orange would fit here. Pre-covid I took the train  3 days a week to an office in Hoboken. Many people would also take it an jump the light rail if they were working in JC.

Rarely had train issues going into Hoboken station. Express train from  Maplewood\\South Orange is 40 mins.
It could be worth looking at Monmouth county and taking the Belford ferry to Paulus Hook
Honestly Woodbridge and the surrounding small towns (Colonia, Iselin, Avenel) would be perfect. I lived there for a while and thought it was great for a family. We just outgrew our house and wanted a change, but the school system is good, town is safe with pretty moderate political environment, with access to almost all of NJ through train and highways. Malls, great restaurants, and close to lots of other cool towns (Rahway, Metuchen, Westfield).
montclair might be a good fit
Bayonne. Always seems nice and quiet, more older people than younger. Streets are clean. One problem is going anywhere further than Jersey City during rush hours made me want to pull my hair out
Another option to everything above is to drive from Maplewood to Liberty Science Center park and ride (30-35 minutes) then take the light rail to Exchange Place. This works well, especially in the summer when traffic is a bit lighter during rush hour.

You can also read my other comment regarding PATH from Harrison is W Orange is the place you settle.
My BIL took the bus from PNC Arts Center they live in Holmdel.  Doable.  Plus you can sleep on the bus.
I drove to JC from towns westward for about 8 years. Clifton,nutley,Bloomfield,Montclair,Belleville,maplewood,Verona‚Ä¶most towns in Essex county will be around 45 with traffic. Montclair,maplewood,Verona are the ‚Äúnicer‚Äù of those towns but they all are fine.
Bergen County would be good choice. Ridgefield Park, Hackensack, etc.

Other option would be Middlesex county by the train line to get to Penn Station or Hoboken and switch over.
Don't sleep on union township. It's super diverse and has a lot going on. The train station is one stop from newark, you can take the path from there. Driving is also a feasible option from there.
bloomfield or glen ridge. easy peasy
OP, I lived by Journal Square (like a block off of India town on Newark Ave), and the walk from my apartment to the PATH, the wait on the platform, then the train ride itself took at least 30 minutes to Newport, and that was a direct train. Idk where you‚Äôre thinking a 45 minute commute is gonna happen consistently unless you‚Äôre in Newport, Hoboken, or Jersey City proper itself, because traffic is an absolute nightmare, and the trains are all crowded as fuck AF. The commute into Manhattan to 34th street was about an hour door to door.

If you want a short, less hateful commute, grab something in Harrison or Newark, jump on the PATH, and take your chances. Parking is not only expensive, but also crowded. As is traffic. As is everything in that area.
Try east rutherford :)
Morristown would be a little more like an hour but worth the look
West New York, Weehawken, north Bergen. There‚Äôs a light rail that goes down the Hudson. Worth looking into
This is the right answer.  Nice house in Maplewood near the train station, train to Newark, switch to Path to Exchange Place.  

  
The other reasonable choice is just JC, but that's not suburban living.
Super helpful to hear from direct experience, thanks for sharing.
OP this is an excellent point and the most important factor of the discussion - there are many great options in & around JC, but holding a commute to 45 minutes isn‚Äôt truly reliable.
This is helpful to know, thank you! Sounds like the best option will be some sort of train if he wants to avoid sitting in JC traffic.
Montclair is nice but if you're planning to buy your home, beware of the property taxes in Essex County!
Seconding Union for what OP is looking for.
Isn't the stretch from Dumont to I-95 by itself about 20 minutes? Hawthorne is pushing it also. The others at least have quicker access to highways, for whatever good that does.
I grew up in Central Jersey and didn't love it so I'm not in a rush to move back to the same area. That said, if there are express trains that could create a smoother commute I'm open to looking.
Grew up there and would not recommend Woodbridge township especially for poc. Better off a few towns over in Rahway or Linden etc
how did you afford parking there every day?
Black fam here in East Rutherford. Wish we looked at Maplewood before making the decision. We are extremely close (17min to midtown) but it's lacking culture and community of towns like S Orange/ Maplewood. Yes for closeness, no for a place you can vibe and build connection
I think Mountain train station in south orange (not to be confused with the regular south orange train station) goes to Hoboken. From Hoboken, you can take the path to JC.

Another option for OP is to drive from west orange, south orange, or Maplewood to the Harrison Path train (you‚Äôd pay for parking) and then JC is minutes away via the PATH.  I sometimes take the train there to NYC and the trains run very frequently at rush hour.
M&E does not go to Newark Penn where PATH is, it goes to Newark Broad. OP could take a Hoboken-bound M&E and then PATH/HBLR to Exchange.
I've been commuting to JC from living between Kearny to the Caldwells and in between for almost 20 years and if someone I knew told me they wanted to reliably commute to JC in under 45 minutes I'd laugh and tell them to live in JC.
I pay almost $40k so I feel your pain.
Like everything else up here, the time of day is critical. I live in Ringwood and work in Carlstadt. My commute is usually about 40 min. 1 hour during rush hour, and 27 minutes with no traffic. 

I checked Dumont and Hawthorne. They both showed a little over 45 min in ""current"" traffic. 51 min I think. Both dead red on Google maps. But from my own house hunting experience, it's worth expanding a little more in the search options because the cons may be offset by other more favorable factors.
Wtf my neighborhood was super diverse lol. Eric LeGrand is a hometown hero
I second the idea to drive to Harrison then take the PATH to Exchange place. I‚Äôve been riding the PATH for many many years and while it has its challenges, it‚Äôs the most effective way (time and cost) to get to JC and lower Manhattan from the ‚Äòsuburbs‚Äô. 

Figure 15-20 minutes to drive to Harrison from West Orange, 10 minutes to park, walk and get on a train (rush hour every 4-5 minutes), then a 15-18 minute ride to Exchange place. 45 minutes is a bit on the aggressive side, but should be less than 60 minutes for sure.
Okay lol. The mayor is a racist drunk. Eric LeGrand played football. Today is Monday. Anything else you wanna add

Woodbridges mayor is a racist drunk- blatantly obvious.

What does those three have in common? They‚Äôre all facts.

Central Compounding Pharmacy in Farmingdale - used them a couple of times and they were fine.
Try Rock Ridge in Glen Rock
I don't think you are limited to NJ, nor am I personally aware of any. My wife uses Belmar, which is in Colorado (ironically, not in NJ)
Rockaway Compounding - Greg is great. They do pet meds too.
If you're in Morris county Rockaway Pharmacy in Kenvil is great. Quick to fill prescriptions and they are very nice and knowledgeable.
Check your prescription insurance though, some are very picky.
I used Old Bridge Drugs and Surgicals. Always had a good experience and they even delivered when I was local.
I dont know where you are.  Delran Pharmacy does compounding, they do the medication for my animals.  They are super nice, they would always ship the medication to me at no charge.  They even came in one time in a blizzard to make meds for my animal who was sick.  They are awesome.
Does the walgreens in summit meet your needs? I'm not sure if they are just specialty or if they also compound.
Livewell pharmacy in Randolph
You can try Schrafts pharmacy. I believe they deliver to a certain distance and ship it also. I think they come up as Schrafts 2.0 if you google them. They might (likely) need the actual script from the doctor before they can say for sure if they can/do compound it.
Well I‚Äôm down by Atlantic county and I‚Äôve used Curexa
Medicos Pharmacy in Elmwood Park.
There's Millers Pharmacy in Wyckoff. They not only compound medication for people but pets as well. A family member used to have her cat's medication compounded by them.¬†

I have used both Town & County in the Wayne area and Colonia Pharmacy in the edison area. Both will FedEx it, or you can pick it up if you are close...beware usually compound Rx is not covered by insurance.
First question to ask before narrowing down to a compounding pharmacy is what type you formulation do you need? Is it a liquid, capsule, suppository, topical or injectable? 

If it‚Äôs an injectable, be certain the pharmacy adheres to proper guidelines. Any other formulation, you should be fine, but see if the pharmacy specializes in the therapuetic category you are looking for (eg hormone replacement, veterinary) 

Do inquire about price as they may not bill insurance and you may not get reimbursed by insurance

Hmm they may be avoiding doing other compounds. I just know we had to send a patient there bc they were unable to find any pharmacy that would compound a drug for their kid. Might be because they were a child so they were making an exception.
Another person did point out they rebranded to 2.0 bc they switched to Feritility. Try some other pharmacies first, but as a last try you can try them. If you really can‚Äôt find anyone who can or will compound your medication they might be willing to. 

Your other option is you can try and call your prescription plan. They might be able to / willing to call in network pharmacies to see if they compound the medication. Again, this will vary on your plan. Some will flat out say no to doing this.
Right, they will usually just tell you that they can send the script to their location. I just wish they would deliver, as are pretty far for us.

Town suggestions for first apartment in north NJ?,"Currently still live at home but my boyfriend and I just got engaged and are ready to find our first apartment (we are having very small wedding, saving for wedding isn‚Äôt priority as we have money already set aside for that)

Ideally we‚Äôd like to not increase his commute too much, while decreasing mine. We both agreed under 30 minutes for both of us would be great. If we can find something that‚Äôs 15 minutes for him and 20-25 minutes for me that would really be ideal (my car is in better shape than his) 

Our budget is 1800. Before anyone says anything for a 1 bedroom not fancy simple apartment in a regular building/shared house it‚Äôs doable. We don‚Äôt want a fancy building or fancy upgrades/appliances, just somewhere safe and clean in a pleasant town. 

We grew up in Elizabeth/Union area so we‚Äôd like something a bit quieter, more residential. But it‚Äôs still important to have access to shops, restaurants and major highways

This seems true. I spent many hours in and out of Hackensack at the cancer center and it seemed like an OK town to live in if you‚Äôre young
That is not an easy commute to Union County. It‚Äôs 20 minutes without traffic just to get to the border of Union County without traffic.

It‚Äôs also out of budget (1 brs go for over 2k) and not quiet.

 When you call the number plead not guilty.   You‚Äôll get a notice to appear in court.  When in court talk to the prosecutor and you will get a ‚Äúplea bargain‚Äù, and plead guilty to a lower speed.
64 in a 40 is reckless and you deserve the points
plead not guilty and talk to the prosecutor, they'll reduce it
Why the hell are you going that fast?
if you go to court you can usually get it taken down to a lesser offense with no points but you're going to pay a significantly higher fine, and then you'll be adding court costs on top of that and a day of your time as well. plus it's still going to show up on your insurance policy and they might still increase your rate because insurance companies use their own point system. so, decide if it's really worth it
Where in North Bergen did you get the ticket?
When I called the Burlington County prosecutor for my 20 mph speeding ticket. He gave me a plea deal after I verified who I was. They I plead guilty, turned that ticket from a few points on my licenses to 0. Lesson learned that dayüëç
It's about the money. Take the day off (loss for you), talk to the prosecuter, bring it down to a lower ticket (no points but higher fine)(loss for you) no longer a clean record and never speed on Kennedy Blvd again,
can‚Äôt swear to this but a court appearance might be required to get the points removed, for which you‚Äôll pay a higher fine. from my experience, pay the ticket and deal with the points, which will come off your record after (i think) two years. either way, someone is getting your money.

Why would you not give the name of your shit provider? It's not like they're gunna come after you for slander lmfao
This post is useless without context. Under 25? Driving, claim or accident history? Any insurance company will charge you an arm and a leg depending on many factors.
1.  Everyone's insurance is going up

2.  There isn't one insurance company you should go to.  Everyone has different rates based on many factors.

3.  You need to do some legwork or contact an agent/broker to get you quotes, that is how you find out what works best for YOU.
Name and shame. Also when you inquire with one, expect 1000 phone calls from others.
Shop them all and shop every two years regardless of what you are paying. Insurance companies go through growth and non growth phases. They also can‚Äôt pick and choose customers because of state regulations so their only tool to lower policy count is to rate people high.
Last time I just used policy genius to shop for me.
I was with the same, reputable company for a long time. I liked them. I had an accident once and they got a check to me within 48 hours. Everything we did was smooth. Recently, I just realized what I was paying, and it was far too much. I contacted my agent and told him I was going to shop, but was giving him the first chance, and he literally cut my rate in half with a new policy. Now that was great; but it irritates me that they pocketed all that money over the years; especially the last few. So now, no more loyalty. I will shop every two years. So try your agent and see what they can do.
Did you check NJM?
NJ Insurance has gone through the roof recently - everyone's policies have gone up. Shop around!
I have progressive, and they were the cheapest for me at 24/25 years old, and they were still $150 a month living in Vernon. I just moved to Illinois a couple of months ago, and my rates went down to $80 per month for almost the exact same coverage. I wish you luck finding something, but based on cost in NJ as it is, it will likely be difficult to find one that is a huge difference in cost.
Get a throwaway email & phone (like Google Voice) if you are going to hunt for yourself. 

Some insurers are non-profits (no stockholders, no ""corporate overlords"") like NJ CURE and NJ Manufacturers.  They are a little better on rates, and they usually give rebates at the end of the year.  But they aren't cheap.  Often, they won't let you buy ""state minimum"" insurance, either.  

Make sure you are doing all you can.  Clean record, no moving violations, no accidents, decent credit, your carfax is accurate with damage/repair history,  good grades if still in school & under 25; no other drivers without insurance in your household;  you don't drive gig jobs; you check for discounts like taking the driver safety courses online; if you only drive 5-10 miles to work, then you may only be driving 7000 miles per year- so you make sure you aren't paying for 15,000 miles. 
If your health insurance allows it, get proof from them that they'll cover your medical bills in a car accident. This may save you money on your auto insurance, too. 
Take advantage of married discount, bundling discount with home / renter/ business / umbrella policies, too.
I had geico increasing me by $50/mo.
Switched to progressive to be $100 cheaper only to climb just as high after 6 months, clean record.
I can‚Äôt remember anymore how much it was, I‚Äôve since moved to North Carolina and bundled with State Farm since they are the ONLY ones who will insure our home

We had to transfer our calls to a closer who always messed up our deals My sister and I worked there two days out of training Our second day. We went to lunch and when we came back, they had other agents in our seats, and there was literally nowhere to sit.  So we left and never came back.
Bottom feeders of society. I have more respect for people gaming unemployment, than those at call centers spamming unsolicited phone calls.

‚ÄúAlways hiring‚Äù is code for ‚Äúhigh turnover and crappy pay‚Äù
Probably related to the call centers in that HBO documentary from last year or the year before. I forgot where they guys were from, maybe near New Brunswick. But it was a similar solicitation.
Lol there‚Äôs a whole documentary on HBO (now MAX) about this. It takes place in NJ too!
Was it above Tiny Tots?  I think Made in America was two or three doors to the left.  Trying to remember what was there.
Circus for kids
I‚Äôve never seen a worse job ad‚Ä¶
Always Hiring doesn't mean that people leave because they have now made too much money and can now retire.
Looks like they're starting the 1-900-HOT-DUCK hotline again. ü§£
""Always hiring!!!!11"" is not a flex
I sold papers over the phone. which consisted of really me doing word searches my entire shift. 50% of the calls were fax machines or modems. the other half was split between angry people and senior citizens or people who couldn't read but wanted a newspaper (to each their own lol). 

we somehow got bonuses for the amount of sales per paper and the papers would switch every 2 hours just about. it wasn't scammy though. if you ordered, you received, bc people would call if they didn't. I did that for about a year or so before it got old. talk about a stress free job lol. 

""oh you don't want the paper? I don't blame ya - have a great evening"" üòÇ
Was that Knowledge Networks?
Is this one of those scam PBA/Superior Officers/Police Athletic League donation companies? They get businesses to donate tons of money, meanwhile the call company keeps like 90% of the money. They‚Äôre very big in NJ for some reason.
Sounds like the place when Michael Scott worked a 2nd late night job at the call center
I worked a few days at a telemarketing call center in New Brunswick. It was awful. Managers just yelled at everyone.
I worked in these places eons ago. Maybe i had a knack for it. I was making like $450 a week in the late 80s. I sold kids books over the phone while the LA riots were going on outside the ladies house. Crazy stuff man. I gotta do the 12 CDs for a penny!! It was easy money if you could do it.
This is in my town, I knew a couple college kids that worked here but I think they may have changed the name? If it‚Äôs the same spot, it‚Äôs pretty brutal in terms of pay/hours, but a good way to get paid quick if you want something short term for a couple months

I was wondering the same. I mean you either qualify or you don‚Äôt and they don‚Äôt pay much so I can‚Äôt think of a way.
Back in the old days, Obama extended unemployment to 100 weeks.  

After a certain amount of weeks, the state will ask you to fill out a journal as to where you applied for work each week to keep getting checks.  While most will send out resumes and attend interviews, some people would do things like go to stores that have kiosks you can apply for employment at, and ""bomb"" by making your application unhirable, e.g. go to Home Depot and apply for a cashier job and ask for $70,000 starting salary.
To stay on unemployment you have to do so many ""job actions"" per week. things like interview and apply for jobs and show proof that you did those things. 

People will game the system by putting together a bare minimum resume, apply for bare minimum jobs, doing poorly at interviews on purpose, etc. so they can stay on unemployment when they likely could get a job if they actually tried to.

They may also be working under the table while also getting unemployment. This is the basic premise at least, people might go even further with fake companies, fake interviews, etc.
One more exclamation and you could help the deaf hear. üëç
That‚Äôs Mr.Richard Demon to you!
Depends which end your on.
you can follow him on Instagram!
Pushing through a legitimate claim is a pain in the ass enough. For the amount of effort it would take to commit unemployment fraud, you might as well get a real job lol
very naive of you
100 weeks? üßê
Vandelay Industries, latex and latex related products.
Unemployment also runs out after a maximum of 26 weeks, and there's a maximum payout of $875/wk. The payout is calculated at 60% of your weekly income.

So you're talking about a maximum of $22750 if you already worked 26 weeks and were making $75833/yr.
Unemployment insurance is just something you pay into and claim when you're laid off. You can't just endlessly collect it with it by applying for jobs, it runs out after 6 months. There's really no incentive for one person to go through all that for just enough money to survive lol

I'm sure there's a ring out there forging fake pay stubs from shell companies, etc but even with a lot of people it's a low-paying crime.
There it is folks... You've cured the deaf. Pat yourselves on the back and submit an application to this Godsend of an establishment.
True, but either would still be preferable to working in a call center.
Well, 99, but close enough:

So what is the alternative?
Not only people keep buying but they are waiving appraisal and other contingency. That means they have to show availability of funds to cover the gap
It's also common to split the loan to get under the limit, the first one is a conforming loan and the second one is a heloc or other floating rate loan.

It has been. I work in the industry. However we have added into the recipe the 100s of thousands of jobs being cut. The federal government is the largest employer in the US. With all the job cuts or the fact that most of these people will have to go to the private sector to work for less is going to have an impact somewhere. Maybe not as big as 2008 maybe bigger we don‚Äôt know.
If you are looking anywhere in any of the popular neighborhoods, these are the prices buyers are seeing for anything that isn‚Äôt a small unrenovated shack. It‚Äôs mind blowing
I guess Somerville's a shithole and all the houses are shacks.  Good luck in your housing search!

Landlord selling 2 family home -is my lease protected?,"My landlord is selling the 2 family home I live in. My lease ends March 2026. Is it possible that if an owner wants to move in, they can force me out legally before end of lease (buy out aside)?

Thank you in advance!",0.64,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jdbpo5/landlord_selling_2_family_home_is_my_lease/,36,1jdbpo5,2025-03-17 12:42,"The first step is to tell your landlord to make it clear to the buyer that the rental agreement is secured for its length.

The next step is to find out if the buyer will continue renting the unit.
Your lease is valid regardless of ownership. It will transfer over to the new owner. So, you're good until the end of the lease.

At the end if the lease, without knowing what's specifically in your lease, in NJ, they usually then convert to a month-to-month basis unless a new lease is signed or a notice of some sort is given by either side. 

Your rent can be raised at that point (with notice) or the intention of the owner to take back the space for thror own use.

You won't know the new owner's true intentions until they actually own it. That said, most 2-family owners buy with the intention of being able to collect rent. It's part of the attraction of such properties and it helps them attain better terms on their mortgages because the bank knows there is money flowing in to help pay the mortgage and upkeep.

All this is the general way for it to go.  Now is a good time  to re-read your lease and any addendums thoroughly. Be a model tenant according to the lease agreement. Don't give them any reason to look for a way to get you out. If they really want you out, there's always a way.

edit:typos
The lease carries over to the new owner although that doesn't mean the new owner has any obligation to renew the lease once it's up (whether that means 11 months from now or next month if you're month-to-month)
The courts in NJ will honor an existing lease when there is a sale of the property.  The new owners may offer you cash to terminate the lease if they plan to move in, but may just leave you alone because your payments are income for them until the end of the lease
NJ landlord here. You are safe until the end of your lease. That's usually the condition of the sale and has to be disclosed in the listing. 

If the buyers are not buying for investment and/or income purposes, they will probably offer you a cash for keys plan. You do not have to accept the cash for keys offer. I know this from experience. You can negotiate this. 

Also, you can give them a set time for showings. You don't have to be available for showings at all times.
The new owner will inherit your lease. They cannot force you out before your lease expires. They (or the seller) can buy it out but it is up to you. I would double check your lease to make sure there are no clauses in there that make you leave in the event of a sale. Most of the time, the seller makes potential buyers aware that there is a tenant already living there and lets them know the duration of the lease. So if they were to try to make you leave, it would be done prior to sale. Just be prepare to be asked to vacate when your lease ends.
The comments are correct within one exception. The new owners may ask you to vacate to accommodate owner or owners *family* to live in the unit. They would have to give you notice to do this, but they are entirely within their rights. Say they move into unit 1. They could ask you to vacate unit 2 as their son and his new wife have a baby on the way and plan on living there.

I have heard of cases where the owner lied, updated the unit, and then put it on the market for a high price. I would think this is rare.
They will probably work out how much time is left vs their own interests on whether to boot you.
What does it say in your lease?
I just recently sold a rental.   Buyers, requested copies of the leases.  They told us via the realtors, "" oh, we are moving into the vacant unit and want to keep the existing tenants ""  They bought the property, all tenant leases were not renewed.  I mean it's there property now,  but why lie about it during the sale process?  I just feel bad for the existing tenants that had been there for over 10 years, they were good tenants too.  No issues with them.
In your online search did you find that nj law stipulates change in use of the property is grounds for evictions?  So if they want to move in, ie no longer use it the unit as a rental, that would be considered a change in use of the property. 

Granted, if they wanted to move in not sure why they would have you there when there purchased it.

That‚Äôs just my understanding.   Never had to deal with this.  Consult with a qualified professional. Good luck
My info can be dated, but I thought that if the Owner was intending to move their family into the occupied units there could be like a 90 day notice... but I am going back 30 years.
Two & three family owner-occupied buildings are NOT covered under the anti-eviction act.  They are exempt.   FYI, the security deposit act excludes owner occupied two and three family buildings.  It's not automatic.  You personally have the right to invoke the Security Deposit Act in writing and the landlord has 30 days to comply. 

You now have a term lease in an owner occupied two family during which time you can only be evicted for cause (non-payment, etc).  When your lease ends (or at any time after that), with notice you can be evicted under NJSA 2A:18-53, which allows the landlord to terminate your tenancy, period, as you are a month to month tenant and live in an owner occupied two or three family. 

They could also opt for NJSA 2A:18-61.11(3) which is the owner wants to occupy your unit.  They can't just say that, they have to actually do it so most landlords will go with the first option.

If you lived in a condo or co-op, it is very possible that your lease could be terminated under the condo clause but that doesn't apply to you.

Your lease and rent history (are you current, etc) would have already been given to the buyer and their attorney during attorney review.  They also would have been told what your security deposit is because it would be transferred to them at closing.  At closing the buyer is given an assignment of leases and rents and an attornment letter, which will also be sent to you.  It's signed by the seller (your landlord) and usually their attorney.  Basically it tells you that your security deposit has been delivered to the buyer, their contact info, where your future rent payment should be sent, etc.  This letter is standard.  

You are getting stirred up over nothing.  You have a lease that ends in a year and the potential buyer knows that.  If you've been paying on time, they are probably happy that they will have the steady income.   

Unless you have some really special circumstances that you haven't shared, dreaming of a buyout is not very realistic.  Do you have a sweetheart rent deal that would make it not practical to sell the property with you in it?  If your landlord hasn't approached you about this, don't bring it up.
Yes, they stayed through their lease.

I just feel bad, since I told them, that the buyers were going to renew their leases.
I‚Äôm a licensed NJ realtor and multi family investor. Yes the new owner has to honor your lease but they are under no obligation to renew it. They have to give you 60 days notice before the last day of the lease that they will not renew, they will asleep receive your security deposit from the previous owner so make sure you get that back as well and don‚Äôt listen to any bullshit they might tell you about.
1. Read your current lease. It is possible it has overriding language in it should such a circumstance arise. How legal it is depends how well written it is.

2. GENERALLY the new owner inherits all existing leases, and the duty to renew them that occurs with that, and the usual exceptions for not renewing a lease.

Most people in situations like that want the place delivered ""unencumbered"", meaning, without any existing tenants or leases in place. It simplifies closing, it lets the new owners do whatever they want when they take ownership, etc. of course there are exceptions, but i'd say generally that is the case in the current market.

What this usually results for is a ""cash for keys"" situation, where the owner pays the tenant a little bit of cash to end their lease early, prior to closing, to facilitate the sale.
You are fine. Houses don‚Äôt sell overnight anyway, takes months.
Thanks, my landlord has said to me after inquiry I am protected/good through the end of my lease next year. My lease term is included in the listing. So I think it would depend on the actions of the new landlord or if the now owner feels forced to do something to get the building sold. They also said they had no intention of selling for many years when I moved in just recently.
Your lease is protected - however any renewal clause is not.  

They are not obligated to renew even if your lease has terms that set an agreement or limits on the renewal . So make sure you work out those details with the new owner well in advance so your not caught off guard.
This, and make sure that the security deposit is transferred and well documented.  I see this as the most common issue.  You may also want to make sure that your move in condition was documented properly to ensure that the new owner will have that.  

But yes, your rental agreement should be protected and both sides have the obligation to hold up their respective ends of the contract.
this is the correct advice.

It really depends on the plans of the new owner as well if they do indeed buy the place with your current lease intact. Yes, you are good for the term of it still, but they can then non-renew if they wish to move in or change the use of the space. They can also price you out.
Thanks! Yes, the showings are a pain even in the limited times. I appreciate your feedback
Ok and in your experience, this overrides any fixed term lease in place? I understand that is good cause in NJ for non-renewal of fixed term lease or eviction on a month to month lease but unclear if it can null and void your lease in place. It seems this needs to happen after a fixed term lease ends.
[deleted]
There is nothing in my lease on potential sale of the building or transfer of lease. There is just provisions on lease renewal or that the lease can be terminated if lease terms are violated or non-payment. So believe it would go back to NJ law on this matter. It‚Äôs a multi family owned by one company not a condo building.
Thank you for first hand insight, they let the tenants stay through their lease term though?
Thanks for your feedback and assurance! it‚Äôs a 2 family but it‚Äôs not owner occupied. I live in an area with extremely high rents and have a sweetheart deal in an old building so that it would not make economic sense for any new buyer to continue to rent at this price. Not looking to get bought out but know I will be up against a big financial shift to move and want to get a sense when I should start planning for that is all. Is my lease protected until next year or if it‚Äôs sold by this Spring/Summer am I out then if the owner wants to move in. It‚Äôs hard to see it being much of an investment property given high taxes and rent prices for just 2 older units without big renovations. I believe more so one family might convert into single family. I know I‚Äôm most likely out but want to see what timing. I appreciate your insights!
Things change, just make sure the buyer knows and then get confirmation on their intent to rent or not.
Did you try to get any advice from the legal sub?
Good call on the security deposit.
Thanks this is what I believed and was okay with but wanted to get confirmation.
I did mentioned that.
I understand it to be an option for the landlord upon buying. I could be wrong, laws could be updated, but yes they can break the lease. I only know because my mom is the landlord, but we've never had to exercise the right. 

Technically I could soon, as I'll be in need, but the current tenants are fine and I'd feel bad about doing that. They are young and don't make a lot to start with.
In most states including ours the buyer needs to honor the lease. It doesn't matter if the new owner intends to rent or not, at least until the lease is up.
I should also have mentioned that in the state of NJ, there are requirements to hold the security deposit in a separate, interest bearing account.  I find that many do not follow this and co-mingle the funds.  Usually this doesn‚Äôt matter but in this scenario, it is important to make sure that it is accounted for.  LL‚Äôs are required to give the bank and account information of where the security deposit is being held.
There are the rules and there are things that people do. Not always the same. Especially when one side has the means to outspend the other.

There is no harm in confirming what should be done.
I thought it was just an interest bearing account .  That‚Äôs all"

I will add, anywhere that is a decent commute to NYC will GENERALLY be a similiar cost to living in NYC. It's just a trade off of ameneties.
we're full
Define reasonable commute. There are a lot of parameters here and people‚Äôs expectations can be quite different. For example do you want nice bars and restaurants nearby or do you want to live in a walkable town? I personally like Rutherford and neighboring towns a lot for being quiet etc and NYC commute isn‚Äôt too bad.
A few New Yorkers once told me that NJ stinks. So maybe consider something else.
r/movingtonewjersey
NJ is only mildly cheaper than NY, you‚Äôll still need a high income to afford to live in. Jersey city, Hoboken, weehawken are all decent areas, but either you make money or you‚Äôll still need roommates.
If you are already living in Rockland, Westchester, Putnam, Orange, or Dutchess counties you won‚Äôt find anything cheaper by moving to New Jersey. It‚Äôs more crowded here than in most of those counties, and the prices are comparable if not more. The only way this possibly works out is if you‚Äôre living in New York City or out on Long Island.
Newark
Agree win people comments.  Need income and/or budget, things you must have, ex good school system, things you'd like to have, ex. walkability.

In addition, where in NYS do you live now?  That will help us see your reference point.
NJ can be expensive so I'm not sure what kind of budget you are working with but that's going to be the most important. Next, what's your tolerance for the commute? (total time, amount of transfers, etc).

Anyway, once you got that... the answer is towns along the NJTransit lines or have bus routes. If I had a pretty good salary (some are comparable to NYC prices btw), the towns I'd be looking at would be Maplewood, Cranford, Westfield, Morristown, Metuchen...
Hi I have lived the very scenario you are seeking. My wife & I bought our home in West Milford and I was commuting to Herald sq in Manhattan. I lived 3 miles off the highway, would drive down rt 23 to Wayne Transit center and then take the bus into Port Authority, from there would walk a mile to my office. Door to Door it averaged around 2 to 2.5 hours EACH way. This was pre-pandemic. Even post pandemic the commute was still around 1.75 to 2 hrs each way. I haven't done it in over a year now but it was creeping back up before I stopped making the commute.

  
Homes currently in West Milford for a 3br 1-2 bath is running around 400K+ to give you perspective. Sussex county is going to be less expensive but will most likely be a longer commute than mine was.
Chatham and Madison are nice, very suburban and the schools are good. Ditto for Millburn and Shorthills. Maplewood is a very cool town, a bit hipper vibe than the previous ones but I'm not as familiar with the schools there.

 I lived in Bergen County pre kids (Hackensack) and that was a decent area but I do prefer living here in Morris county.

Eta, Morristown is really nice too, it's a bigger town with lots to do and a good night life for younger people.

Yep! Agreed.

I mean, I don't even think one can answer this with just commute time since he could live in down town Paterson for cheap and have a fairly easy commute but then get murdered his first day out, hah.

I don't know why people ask these questions in such a vague manner with no income, no pricing requirements, etc. NJ is such a varied, fun, cool state that we kinda need to know a bit about what an OP wants.
I would want to live in a town that has stores, restaurants, parks etc. that are within walking distance, and a train station that is less than a 30 minute drive from residential areas to go into NYC
Irvington is pretty affordable as well.
Because people are dumb and don‚Äôt do their own research. They think that just because it‚Äôs not NYC that NJ is cheap and an easy place to just willy nilly find a place to live and go on with their lives."
Turnpike,"So every Monday I drive from 80/95 by Teaneck, (5am-630am) south towards exit 9 on turnpike for New Brunswick, how is it that 95% of the overhead lamps do not work on the Turnpike. Besides pouring rain, and dealing with fast moving trucks, you have to deal with no lamps. The DOT wonders why there are so many accidents and traffic issues, why not get the lamps on? Can‚Äôt blame it on daylight savings time, because you spring forward for more darkness. I guess I‚Äôm just ranting but how do we go about getting these fixed?",0.67,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jd9ovz/turnpike/,2,1jd9ovz,2025-03-17 10:44,"NJTA is responsible for the maintenance of the New Jersey Turnpike, including its lighting systems.

Point Pleasant Beach Arcades,"I was recently going through some old boxes and found some ticket vouchers for the arcades at the boardwalks on the Point Pleasant and Seaside Beaches. These are the vouchers that look like checks and they used one of those press machines to imprint the number of tickets you got, if anyone still remembers those. They‚Äôre had a handwritten master ledger to keep a record of them. 

They‚Äôre all about 20-25 years old and was wondering if anyone in a similar situation has had any luck redeeming them? I last redeemed one around 12 years ago and they accepted it for redemption for the historical novelty of it. The cashier had to get a manager because she had never seen them before haha. This was also before arcades in general started going all digital so they might not even have paper tickets anymore?

On a side note, do these arcades still have the slot machines and video poker machines? My grandpa and I used to play those a lot. Would be nice to experience playing those again for some good memories‚Ä¶ ",1.0,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jd6eoa/point_pleasant_beach_arcades/,4,1jd6eoa,2025-03-17 06:35,"Jenks Pavillion arcade still uses paper vouchers

Why are there so many condemned buildings/storefronts in Washington (Warren Co)?,Was driving from NY to PA yesterday and drove through Washington's business district. I noticed quite a few buildings and storefronts with X or \ placards on them. It just struck me as a disproportionate amount of structural issues in one area. Was there a natural disaster or other issue that caused this? No luck Googling.,0.94,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jd4vah/why_are_there_so_many_condemned/,10,1jd4vah,2025-03-17 04:48,"The downtown area was mostly destroyed by a fire in 1962. 

Similar situation to what happened to Newark after the riots in 1967. After the infrastructure that supports the economic vitality of an area is compromised, it's often abandoned because there's no money to rebuild.
I have friends that live there and it has been like that for the last 20 years.   With 31 being build-up over the years, no business really could sustain itself.   I remember around 2007-2008 there were many foreclosures in the area.
small town in the middle of no where means very limited commercial interest and basically no chain places outside of fast food, dunkin, etc. 

it's tough running a small business anywhere, but places like that don't get enough traffic to support most businesses

The plight of many rural towns where the citizens themselves would rather go to Walmart or order on Amazon instead of going to a local store or business.
Look up the tax rates in the borough as well. Insane.
but what is weird are condemned buildings for lease

[https://imgur.com/a/ZMxYkwT](https://imgur.com/a/ZMxYkwT)
That big red and white X in the third picture doesn't mean it's condemned it means that it's vacant. It's supposed to be a big, easy to see, visual indicator that the entire building is empty so if there's a fire or some other disaster rescue workers know what they're doing with the risk/reward ratio.
This was exactly the one that made me scratch my head.

Often for me. It‚Äôs also my comfort background noise show.
The Sopranos is something I watch every few years along with Frasier and TNG. it holds up pretty well honestly
Rewatched it during Covid lockdown. It's a sharp as ever.
i've been meaning to rewatch it now that i live in the area where a lot of it was filmed
In the present day, North Jersey itself is more diverse and a lot less uniformly Italian than it is portrayed as in the show. It's a good show but it's not a 100% accurate representation of North Jersey.
Watching for the first time now. It absolutely holds up.
The Mafia is basically all gone and dead, and the towns themselves don‚Äôt look much similar anymore, but it nails the culture of the state and ‚Äúvibe‚Äù of the people.
I think the main thing that made the show stand out culturally is long dead; we now take for granted that there could be good character development for villains.

The angles it has on sex, race, and mental health were avant-guarde in its day but are now completely outdated decades later.

I think the show is borderline irrelevant and unwatchable from an entertainment perspective. But the show will always mean something to New Jerseyans cuz of all the memes and nostalgia."

I don't think they will give you any special treatment compared to anyone else that is being let go.

They do this to try to avoid getting sued for age discrimination.

Their entire existence revolves around winning the election. Anything after is irrelevant. Trump could kill off their workplace, get their unemployment denied, cut their social security, literally spit in their face, and they'd still just be like ""Haha, liberals. Trump won! You lost!"" outside of the foodbank that just lost funding.
Because it's a cult.
This right here is the derangement syndrome they love to cite.

They don‚Äôt understand why people dislike their opinion, because he won, they thought that meant we had to like him now? We‚Äôre convinced right?

They like making someone they find inferior to them mad. They take it personally when people disagree with them because their lives are simplified down to like 3 or 4 colors. There are many facts they don‚Äôt know or care to understand.

They know they are seen when they leave these signs out. Otherwise, they feel no validation because nothing is at stake in their life. 

Petty, gross, and stupid.
I see them as being defensive. They are feeling the pressure, which is great since you're talking the backwoods of NJ--Sussex County.  Look at the sign that says ""I support Trump and *I will not apologize for it.*"" That is defensive.

Just the fact that they're out there at all shows they feel the need to show support. Now why would that be?  Hmmmm.
These people wake up thinking about trump, and they go to bed thinking about trump.
Cuz they barely got through highschool and never left their hometowns
It's 100% a cult, I pass one particular house on my commute on rt 23(also in Sussex County) that has a giant banner on their fence that says ""Thank you President Trump for making America great!!!"" Do they think Trump is personally going to pay them a visit? He literally has no reason to come to a blue state like New Jersey.
I couldn't tell you, I've voted for a lot of presidents and have yet to do so much as put a bumper sticker on my car.

I remember from 2000-2016 all the Bush and Obama flags and signs people posted on their lawns with slogans or whatever supporting their beloved president.

Because they have brain damage.  And they're in a cult.  That doesn't go away just because he won.
Because they are assholes and like to act like assholes.
Sussex County bred, born and raised and would love to counter protest at Rosa's Corner.
Brain worms.
Won? Try stolen. Elon rigged.
Because they're mentally unstable and it's a cult
Because it‚Äôs a cult and people up here in Sussex are some of the most uneducated, and most racist in the state.
They have to constantly convince themselves they made the right choice.
they are TFG...Too Far Gone, deep deep in the cult and can't/won't get out now because it would make them question their whole identity and belief system. Most people do not want to look deep within themselves and question why...it's just easier to follow along.

They‚Äôre trying to save face for how Trump is literally undeniably destroying the country in front of their eyes. Admitting they were wrong is not an option (especially since to vote Democrat they‚Äôd have to tolerate others ü§¢) so they have to heave support even harder than usual

We need to be very worried about the messianic way people see him in about three years and nine months. If he won't go quietly, there are an alarming number of people who will excuse that, too.
I really don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trying to convince people to support him. I think they‚Äôre just congratulating themselves on supporting him. 

They have developed a parasocial relationship with the version of him that they believe exists. Supporting Trump is their entire community.
Because it's a cult. I'm in Sussex Co too and some idiots have lawn signs from 2016 (they just scratched ""Pence"" off of it). It's pathetic and weird.
Its a cult
Ever seen the 2006 documentary Jesus Camp? It's about an evangelical summer camp for children. At one point the adults bring out a life-sized cut out of George W Bush onto the stage, call him a ""godly man"" and invite the children to pray on him to end abortion. Like he was some sort of prophet, lol. This is like that, but instead of the goal being to end abortion it's to own the libz.

I grew up in sussex county. It's definitely if ""own the libs"" was a place. It's terrible out there. Politics in general is just ""my identity is to be as close minded as I can"".¬†
They voted to fuck everything up and get pleasure by rubbing it in our faces. They're pathetic. History will not be kind to them.
I have a local guy near me in Parsippany who has this sign outside his out at Christmas that read, ""SANTA EVICITION PLEASE HELP""

Now after Trump was sworn in it says, ""TRUMP EVICITION PLEASE HELP!""

Does this idiot really think his stupid small sign on the side of a road will catch trumps attention to save his small house? It's their whole identity. They can't pick up their own bootstraps to prevent eviction, but Trump will somehow magically swoop in with money and rescue them personally. the delusion is outstanding
It filled a void in their empty lives.
Because It's Sussex county...There ain't much else to do..
Is a cult! I have a neighbor 5 houses from me down scale like this and he is a Veteran.. Deep in the Kool-aid
Because it‚Äôs a cult. They accuse those who disagree as brainwashed. Just like a cult.
It's a cult.
‚ÄúStick it to the libs‚Äù became their only political goal.
Cause they are lost people hoping that they will be noticed by someone who couldn't care any less if they existed. It's their whole identity and it won't go away. 

I dont mind people showing support to a candidate they like, but this worship is just sad (it would be sad no matter whom they supported).
Rubbing it in people's faces. Sad.
Pretty soon, they're going to get stuff thrown at them from cars
Some homes decked out in literally every county ü§Æ
It‚Äôs a Children of the corn,kinda place üôÅ
Insecurity
Because people want attention, thats it.
Cultists coping with their bad decision.
Cult. That‚Äôs why.
Brian Johnstown, Hale Bop, Manson Family, Pol Pot, QAnon, Branch Davidions,  Scientology, the Third Reich... list goes on.
Because they're such losers, they don't know what it's like to win.
It's all they got. Their lives are so miserable, this is the highlight and sole thing remaining for them.
Cultists are gonna cult.
Losers with no life.
Spent most of my life in NJ, but I'm really disappointed in  those lost souls...
This is what tru.o derangement syndrome looks like
Loneliness and some mental illness.
Because they are big mad at all the protests.
It's their reason for existing. To bring 'pain' to liberals. They think his face hurts us.
besides the point but why do all of these without fail look like shit. it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs an executive order around tackiness.
They will do it until he cuts their SSI payments.
It‚Äôs their whole life. They had nothing interesting going on before they were dragged out of the woods
They are trying to tough it out‚Ä¶.knowing that they voted for an idiot.
Because they're in a cult.
Daddy issues.
Undiagnosed mental illness be like that
It‚Äôs all they‚Äôve got.
Are they going to be waving Trump flags after Trump kicks the bucket? I wouldn't be surprised.
Ask any one of them which red state is better, that they‚Äôd‚Äô rather live in
*This* is Trump Derangement Syndrome, if you ask me. Participation in a cult
Cult
It's a cult
Losers don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to win. They‚Äôve probably never had a personal victory.
It‚Äôs a cult. They are in a cult.
It's a personality cult.   Some of them still talk like he's an underdog or that the system is working against him.

I drive by a house that just put their Trump/ Pence banner back up.  I think they're now signaling to each other that they're in the group because they see the leader is really targeting other groups, which is kind of scary.
Because they've turned politics into a sporting event. There is no grey in their thinking; it's simply black and white, and they won. 

It's like the high school wrestler in South Jersey who, with his dad, took part in a brawl at a match. He was disqualified from competing in the championship, but the [parents sued and won](https://www.nj.com/highschoolsports/2025/03/wrestling-champ-repeatedly-punched-a-minor-during-ugly-brawl-police-say.html), so the kid who has a college wrasslin' scholarship was allowed to compete in the championship. There were lots of comments supporting what he and his dad did because 'they won'.
Trying to recycle the eyesore, sodden remains of their egregious tent store. This is truly the face of mental illness. Oh, for a flamethrower.
Trying to convince themselves that they didn‚Äôt screw up.
Because it‚Äôs Sussex county
Trust me, no one is trying to convince anyone to support Trump & Co. This is all a game called, ***""Owning the libs"".***
Because cultists gotta cult
For some people, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to admit being wrong. The shame is unbearable.
Sore winners. Always the victim.
because it‚Äôs sussex county
I thought those fucking chodes were DONE with their WAWA Propaganda....until I saw them out again this Saturday. I think it's time we had some COUNTER Stumpers out there! Get a few folks to go out there with sign and bull horns...giant pictures of Trump with Epstein, signs that say Elon and Starlink stole the election, but provide NO evidence of it...just SAY we do and ""Trust Us"". Maybe some ANTIFA Flags, ""Have you had an Abortion Today?"" Flags....the whole Shebang! I would LOVE to see that shit go down but I'm also scared that some POS in a Cyber Truck or F-150 might get so butt-hurt that they'd try to mow us down! I think I'd risk it though.....although my wife would blow a gasket if she found out I went out there looking for trouble...she's scary!! LOL
Because people who live in Sussex county either moved there from somewhere out in east jersey due to lower property tax, or they have lived there their whole lives and know absolutely nothing outside of sussex county. They think theyre Pennsylvanians. The people who think its weird and obnoxious are the normal people who just wanted to buy a house for a good rate. I have friends who live there that have been telling me theres more liberal communities forming because of that. But there's still those weirdos who haven't had something this exciting happen to them in their whole lives- They're racist or they think stereotypically and have no idea how to handle themselves now that our president aligns with that. Just my take ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
They aren‚Äôt smart enough to realize the election happened. South jersey might as well be in the deep south.
Fox News has brainwashed his cult into thinking immigrants are taking everything from them. That‚Äôs why they love him but meanwhile HE is the one stripping everything from them. Their integrity compassion empathy human decency and now their jobs their livelihood their grocery money healthcare etc.

![gif](giphy|l0IxYWDltdHEqujnO)
I live in Ocean County... It's the same thing here! They definitely are not the silent majority, they are the loud obnoxious minority.
I prefer it actually so I know exactly where they are.
'Cause *it's a f'n cult*.
Seeing the same clowns occasionally in Somerset county as well.
Mentally Ill
It's a cult
Mental illness
Gotta praise the Great Leader.  Freaking cult
Because it‚Äôs a cult and he is their lord n savior for some reason‚Ä¶
Because he is a cult and I see this crap everywhere. I'm in Central Florida and it's everywhere. I've seen it in parts of New England, outside of Buffalo and Long Island recently. It's everywhere. It's all over Ocean County too. I see it too as far down as just outside Wildwood near the Wildwood airport.

I swear I see more Trump and MAGA stuff now than I did in circa 2016-2020.
Because it‚Äôs a cult
Cut that shit down and burn it
Everyone there are inbreds and dont know their asses from their elbows. Their opinions will never matter ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Trumplikkkans think their sports team won the election.
If it‚Äôs on public property just cut them down and throw em away. If it‚Äôs on someone‚Äôs property don‚Äôt.
They took a loan out to buy those signs, and they're fixin to get as much use outta em as possible
Because they‚Äôre fascists.¬†
Well, I can tell you it's not because they're in a personality cult.
Cultists doing cult things
There are people that are planning on how to have him back for a third term.
![gif](giphy|3oz8xTl6sGKbuRPDDW|downsized)
Their idea of a victory lap I guess
Sorry to use a 30 year reference,  but they think they're Burt Reynolds in Boogie Nights, but they don't realize they're William H Macy and his wife, and the driveway crowd are the billionaires.
Because it's a cult.
Sussex county shouldn‚Äôt even be part of Jersey‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs children of the corn land over there.
Because, because, because all those lefties are mean to him and we must show him that us conservabalism alpha here‚Äôs must cum to his rescue and, and, and show him how much we honor him and how much merch we are happy to buy in his honor and once fixes inflation and food prices we will be able to buy eggs again and drink them every morning like ROCKY did to get big and strong and make Sussex.. not that pansy one in England but the‚Ä¶. Strong Sussex in Jersey.. not the island Jersey in pansy England either.    But the Jersey Strong Jersey right here in ‚Äòmerica‚Ä¶ YES!!  Jersey Strong Sussex because WE KNOW that our fearless leader will show us the way‚Ä¶ but ONLY IF WE BUY MORE FLAGS AND SIGNS!
The campaign never ends in cult land.
It‚Äôs their entire personality now
Insecurity.
Cause they know they are outnumbered... Compensating for a perceived weakness. Also the actual do nothing attitude from Democrat party leadership in general doesn't help.
![gif](giphy|3ohs80EuzI2k3jFX6o|downsized)
It's a cult dude. How many cult related activities really make sense if you examine them from a neutral and logic based perspective?
because it‚Äôs a cult
If I may quote some Star Trek, as it is pretty relevant...

""A true victory is to make your enemy see they were wrong to oppose you in the first place. To force them to acknowledge your greatness.""  --- Gul Dukat (perhaps one of the most relatable, but horrible villains in Star Trek)
Weren't they just in the papers for being klan members
They have a car show there every weekend.  Well not really a car show.  Everyone in the area that has a classic car or just a car they‚Äôre working on drive it to that Wawa, pops open their hood, then just wander around for a few hours.  It‚Äôs rednecks with nothing better to do.
Incredibly sore winners
At this point, it is a cult.
It‚Äôs a cult.
These people are truly lost.
Because they are stupid & have no life outside of blindly supporting their leader
They are in a cult
Because they‚Äôre morons.
Someone I know calls him daddy. Like wtf!!!!!
Because it's a cult.
Because it‚Äôs a cult.
It's a cult and in typical cult fashion, they're doubling down.
This isn't a political campaign, this is a mental illness and they crave your attention. Just ignore them.
Because we're surrounded by a moronic cult
They have no personality and believe this Is a Valid personality
TRUMP BACKS the BLUE (except capitol police)
I'm genuinely curious of what happens to maga when trump leaves.. I doubt anyone can fill those shoes
To own the libs! Ugghhhh I hope these cult members wake up before they die and realize the idiots they were‚Ä¶
CAUSE THEY ARE IN A CULT!!!
Wait there is a Wawa in Sussex county!!??

The election was the peak of his term, its been downhill since.
Cults love to cult
Cause they‚Äôre losers.
it's not just sussex county btw. it's everywhere. there are several houses here in somerset county with somewhat elaborate trump signs. i can immediately think of the one on lamington rd in branchburg (coming around the curve just before the back entrance to rvcc). there are a lot of them in hillsborough. i'm just saying there are a lot of people who are fully brainwashed into trump's cult of personality to the point that there may be no return.
It's like in Cuba. The ""Revolution"" never ends, even after victory. Or, the ""victory"" is always in the future, hence, ""Hasta La Victoria, siempre"", as Che used to say.
It's their entire identity at this point. My dad and his wife have Trump flags INSIDE their house. It's all they talk about; winning the election, how the previous election was stolen, and how stupid libs are. They don't talk about anything related to policy, the economy, or world happenings. Just their lord and savior Donald Trump.
Cult
Remember, these people only exist for seeking attention by engagement. Ignore, ignore, ignore, and eventually, they will become irrelevant.
It's a fucking cult, enough said.
Why? The hardcore are members of a cult.
Bc it's a cult
It‚Äôs a freaking cult. Country is already in tatters after not even two months. What are they trying to prove? That they worship a deranged dictator wannabe who has yanked the economy, caused inflation; ruined the markets, attempted to circumvent the constitution, and harmed us Americans. I‚Äôd say throw eggs at it.
Yeah, I always thought that‚Äôs freaking weird. In the past, you might have a sign in the yard‚Ä¶ A bumper sticker on the car‚Ä¶ But once the election is done regardless of who won‚Ä¶ Those things go bye-bye. But no, people have to treat politics on the right like rooting for their favorite sports team.
I actually drove by a ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Go Brandon‚Äù sign this weekend. Folks need to catch up with the times!
Because they are uneducated losers who have this one ‚Äúwin‚Äù and they are going to ride it as long as possible. Most people just laugh at them when they drive by because it is obvious that they have nothing better to do than put their signs ip and hope for a reaction from someone. Most people have actual lives to lead so they just ignore them.
Cult behavior
b/c its a cult
Because they are a cult and they know ppl are upset with him.  Hope they are happy.  Goes to show the low intelligence level they have.
Ignorance is bliss and loves the poorly educated. The cult is real
They‚Äôre doing it all around Warren County too.
For all their foaming at the mouth about ""Trump Derangement Syndrome,"" we all know who the truly deranged are.
Anything to trigger the libs. They stand for nothing outside of reactionary pearl clutching, pretend oppression, and cynical pandering. If they weren‚Äôt such ugly crybabies about everything I‚Äôd almost feel bad for them.
Because it‚Äôs a cult.
Because they need a distraction
I mean... i remember seeing biden signs in 2022, but yes i think either way its pointless to keep em up
Cult of traitors going to do cukt of traitors thing's
They don‚Äôt have jobs
It‚Äôs a cult.
because this isn't the end
Because they are pathetic.
Room temperature IQs
Simps
Attention seekers.
They‚Äôre a cult and have no other personality.
77 million people voted for him and I'm sure there are millions that didn't vote but still support him as well. Whether we like it or not he has a lot of support. I'm still going to keep voting Democratic like I always do, but there's no denying 77 million people voting for him is a lot.

It's sad to think about because I feel like people from other countries assume most of us support him because he won the popular vote, but I was one of the 75 million Americans that voted for Kamala Harris. I just can't believe or understand how he went from 62 million votes in 2016 to 77 million in 2024.

Edit: Thanks for the down votes everyone!. I guess it isn't just people on the right that live in an alternate reality and hate facts. I wish the election had gone differently and I did my part and voted for Kamala, but there is no denying 77 million is a lot of people and those are just the ones that voted. Ignoring reality is why this happened in 2016 and again 2024. We can't lie to ourselves and pretend this is a small minority of people or we are doomed to having this cycle keep repeating.
I saw them on Ross Corner the Saturday after Trump won. There was a sign that they were selling flags so I figured they were trying to sell off the merch. I hadn't seen them since then. I hope today was an exception, or maybe they're out again now that it's not as cold out. I wonder if they'll still be out there after Trump tanks the economy and grocery prices keep going up.
Ehhh, in all fairness there were Biden signs in my town until 2023 lol
Because they're mentally ill
I feel like I've been actively seeing less of them as the term has continued. 

Granted I think their are as many doubling down as I see coming down
Well no one there. They hung a clothesline and scrammed.
I‚Äôm still waiting for them to come out saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt think he would do all this,‚Äù and even though I‚Äôm screwed, there will be a tiny bit of satisfaction.
Because they are trash.
Because they still aren't happy and can't figure out why
Some people are cultish.
It‚Äôs not just Sussex. I see it everywhere. Not in this volume, tho.
They have nothing else in their lives to celebrate
They don't have jobs
Because it's all they have.
It's a cult. Symbolism has to be preserved to prevent emotional breakdowns.
Its a cult , it is their identity now
It‚Äôs a cult.
They are committed to stupid. It‚Äôs a cult.
The crass behavior is what brings them all together, because that‚Äôs who they are.
News travels slowly up there.
""Won""
It‚Äôs pride.
They're fascists who enjoy rubbing it in others faces.
By the WAWA right? Saw them too. They're so aggressive
Seconding what a lot of folks are saying here which is it‚Äôs a cult following and very much a part of these folks‚Äôs identities lol. But if anyone reads this and is a resident of Somerset, how come the huge Trump flag that the construction business had flying on the corner of New Brunswick Rd and Cedar Grove was taken down? It was up way after the election. And it was massive. Then one week I visited my parents and it was gone. I‚Äôm only asking here since someone was able to give me intel about the guy who has the most hateful shit on his lawn on Demott.
Because it‚Äôs a cult.

![gif](giphy|3o6Yg95cjpPMOiqgG4|downsized)
They‚Äôre in a cult.
MAGA would happily shit in their own pants just to have you smell it.

It‚Äôs stupid my neighbor had one up till a week ago, finally enough neighbors got thru to him
because it‚Äôs a cult.
It‚Äôs hard to believe but some Trump supporters are dumber than others. Did you see a short bus in the parking lot?
They‚Äôre saying ‚Äúfuck you‚Äú. Over and over. That‚Äôs the extent of their intellect. 
‚ÄúFuck you‚Äú
Go ask them?
I‚Äôm old enough to remember the ‚Äúsilent majority patriots‚Äù demonstrating their support for Richard Nixon during the Watergate investigation leading up to his resignation.  Maybe they worry Trump‚Äôs work may be undone or is unfairly mischaracterized so far?  I heard that 42 percent of Republicans approve of his job in a recent poll.  And some people think with their heart, not their head.
Because their lives suck and blame democrats. It is sad that a persons identity is tied to someone who can care less about them.
It‚Äôs a cult, populated by (mostly) folks with some variety of personality disorder. Also I recommend reading the studies conducted on liberal vs conservative minded individuals. The preponderance of evidence shows that the amygdala in liberal-minded people processes new information through a lens of logic and reason.
The amygdala in conservative-minded people processes the same information strictly through a lens of fear and passion.
Its a cult that's why
Burn them
It's like the overplayed trope of veganism, or crossfitting.  Its their whole identity.  And I saying that as someone who voted for him Theee times.
They‚Äôre rubbing it in.  It‚Äôs indicative of the type of people who support Trump.
Trump won Jersey? Huh.
because war is a force that gives people meaning
Cults enjoy the camaraderie
Because it‚Äôs a cult. They are in a cult.
It‚Äôs a cult
That's just a form of mental illness - these obsessed people will simp for him for the rest of their miserable lives, regardless of who would currently be in power or what things he will inevitably do that will personally affect their lives in a negative way.

Reminds me of the Stalin era in USSR, where people continued to adore the Stalin and kept his portraits all over their miserable apartments even after their own family members were sent to GULAGs for being ""enemy of the people"".
Because it's a cult and cinnamon Hitler is their god.
Remember how Al Queda/ISIS folks drive around with flags and masks?

Yeah this is the white person version of that.
I see more trump signs in Wayne NJ than in Sussex county
They, quite literally, have no identity outside of this cult. They are zeros, probably from a long line of zeros and have zeros for children. This gives the ignoramus' a voice.
There's a total of about 12 teeth in that entire county. Not surprised by this at all.
Fragile ego‚Äôs!
Reminds me of a neighbor who had George Wallace signs on his lawn 6 months after the election was over üòÜ
Cult.
Those fucking crazies are out there every Saturday.
Because it's a cult
Simple, they are spiking the ball in the end zone over and over.
I don‚Äôt have any answer as to why, but these people are nuts! They‚Äôll walk into the middle of the road sometimes and you have to dodge them while you‚Äôre driving.
Why are you mad though?
W ppl tbh
Because he‚Äôs a symbol of the people‚Äôs defiance now.
To just further show their 'brain don't work good'.
üôÑ
It‚Äôs not the brightest county and town. Trust me
Forgot to ‚Äúreload‚Äù the clothesline? Maybe they need to unplug it and plug it back in again?
They have always felt threatened by the liberal educated class and have always been easily persuaded to vote against their own selves,believing their problems stem from minorities, gays, trans and educated liberal people instead of from the billionaire club that owns the GOP. Trump has taken that and amplified it and has created a cult in the process. For once in their lives they feel they are the elite.
Gloating and have nothing else going on in their lives
Still see these pop ups in Morris, Warren, Monmouth and many other counties
Brainwashed by thier god
Where'd they park their Rascal Scooters?
Starts with a C, rhymes with 'insult'
Saw them every weekend and wondered why Wawa never had a problem with it
It's a cult
I can‚Äôt imagine being cucked by a half dead bloated liar covered in orange make up, slithering around in its own shit.
When I was a teacher some students were what I call hard learners.  This had nothing to do with their academic ability. It had to do with how many times can you have bad results and continue doing it over and over again.  These people are clearly hard learners.
They don‚Äôt have access to the internet and can‚Äôt read?
There were people doing this on rt. 35 during his first term too.   They make it their personality.  

Like, go hard on something, sure, but not when it's a fascist douchebag who actively ruins the lives of people.
I really want to sympathize with trump supporters, like they are so desperate for a win, a ray of hope, anything to make them feel better about their own lives and they've latched on to the most ignorant, harmful team they could. To them I think this is no different than being vehemently supportive of their arbitrarily chosen favorite sports team - they just want to win at something because they lose at everything else. I want to sympathize, but the damage their tragically misdirected feelings is causing makes that impossible for me. Fuck them.
They want to rub it in our faces, and also change the dominant culture of our country.  In the past conservatives have not felt free to express many of their views openly, particularly those rooted in bigotry.  They've always considered themselves to be the silent majority, now they feel more comfortable being open (and loud) with their views.

I'll tell you, they aren't sending their best... graphic designers.  The left got all of the artistic talent and creativity.
Cultists gonna cult.
why do we care about signs..
cult
They are sore losers with victim mentality
This is what got weird. To make any political candidate your whole thing is weird
Because it‚Äôs a cult.
A lot of Trumps supporters have trouble understanding the concept of democracy. He woke these people up from their coma of misery/despair and now think wearing their heart on their sleeve is their moment of a collective duty. It‚Äôs trivial at best
I literally cannot believe at this point people are still openly supporting him.
Yeah my no brained neighbor in somerdale still has his dumb fuck sign on his front porch.  Waiting for it to lose the attracting when he is affected by the ill will that is running this shit.
It's Sussex !
For the same damn reason they‚Äôre still doing it along rt 9 in tuckerton and new Gretna
It‚Äôs not a political base - it‚Äôs a delusional fan base. How
I see hypocrisy is still alive and well after sifting through these comments!
Some of us enjoy collecting liberal tears. It's a fine hobby.
Lol it‚Äôs really creepy at this point. It‚Äôs idolatry and obsessive worshipping and of trump of all people. Imagine going back to like 2005 and telling people this is what the future is like.
‚ú®Mental Illness‚ú®
They're in a cult
It‚Äôs fascism
They are not watching the news. Only israeli propaganda
they‚Äôll have to sell those flags soon as shop rags to afford everything that the orange people fu*ker did to us
It's a cult.
At least stupid is easy to identify now
It's a cult!
i‚Äôm sadly in sussex county now and this is because the school systems here suck and everyone is uneducated. so they like a dumbass
Sussex County is so beautiful it‚Äôs a shame these Trump Cults ruin it.
It‚Äôs a cult‚Ä¶ ‚ò†Ô∏è
County has oath keepers and white Supremacists in all levels of local government.  Bunch of hillbillies out there.
Yes, it‚Äôs a cult but you know what? By being visible, Trump voters were able to normalize the brand and sell it to regular people. Guess what? It works.

We the people who don‚Äôt want to be steamrolled by stupid and malicious broligarchs need to be out there on the street corners.  Especially in red districts like Tom Kean‚Äôs (NJ 7).  Make the GOP own this shit show and make the brand so toxic that they can never win an election again. Tesla protests are a good start for ex.
Because they have nothing else. Donald Trump is their entire life and personality, it‚Äôs absolutely pathetic
I think the the best term I've found so far is 'extinction burst'
Same reason either side hangs signs, because they‚Äôre stupid
Everyone else can put anti trump stickers, signs, and flags up, so why can't they? Freedom of speech for both parties if I'm not mistaken
His core demographic is struggling economically, seething with resentment when they look around and see diversity (the racial composition of America changing) and they are spending too much time online, targeted by algorithms that serve them up material set to upset them to foster  additional engagement. They like the fact that trump is unpolished, brash and obnoxious. They are aware of the backlash against him and want to show their support for him as he upsets the world with his disruption and incompetence. They believe that he‚Äôs tearing down the fabric of society to make it a better place for them - not realizing that ultimately it‚Äôs trumps actions that will further erode their quality of life and that they‚Äôre being duped.
The same reason they do it at the corner of 206s and Lamington.
Why not?
Because it‚Äôs a cult
Passaic county and Morris county as well.
Guess what NJ has highest cost of living we need to be republican wake up. It has nothing to do with who you like. Vote for your paycheck.
cult
because it‚Äôs sussex county.
They had a rally in Bedminster on Saturday. I thought they‚Äôd be finished with them after he won.
Because it‚Äôs a cult
It‚Äôs the rules of the cult! They are slave to their ‚Äúking‚Äù. Must not question. Must obey. Must send money. Must not think for themselves. On and on - right off the cliff, each and everyone of them!
NJ is as racist as anywhere else in the US. And those northwest nj areas were, if not still, heavy with the klan.
I think they're doing it because he's getting stopped by judges at every point. The deportations, defunding a lot of agencies, etc. They have nothing better to do outside of this. They're trying to prove that he's doing better when he really isn't. Not that the other party of the two party system would have been better.
It's how they identify!
Trump gives a voice to his base‚Äôs anger.
If you know anyone there, you'd understand lol
yea there's a small group of Trumpers that come out every Saturday morning in Bedminster just to stand there with signs... idk why üôÑ
So i just visited the Poconos this weekend and I was shocked by the lack of trump signs and flags. I counted maybe 10? From stroudsburg, to driving down 611. Real rural areas and the farmers he's fucking over

Tons of Ukraine flags! You had to actively look for MAGA shit. I stopped in the Walmart on a crowded Saturday. Not a single maga customer, no hats, no shirts. 

Homeless people at intersections begging for money. I gave a dollar to one, the line of cars behind me, then each gave a dollar. We started a chain. Guy used it to buy a pizza for him and his gf that are homeless

My point being those who suffer most from his policies, there towns are clear of maga shit cause they know.

Folks in NJ are sadly too rich and to out of touch to have any concept of politics affecting them negatively. All these EOs are hurting minorities, not white people.

Sussex is just affluent white people...so it makes sense they stay loud. Toms river is a bunch of middle class white people about to get the ladder kicked out from under them. When the middle class ends (soon) the maga shit will come down in Tom's
River. 

Egg prices and insulting Ukraine have already started to make flags come down.
Because people are still not waking up to the reason why he won the popular vote.
This is your whole personality per typical democrat behavior. Get over it and trump has done more than Obama and biden combined oh and the coup of kamala lol. You people are deranged at this point.
Because people have freedom of speech and can do what they want, some of you seem to have forgotten that or are too scared to actually use your FOS, same goes for the left they can continue to bash trump and say this and that about conservative ideas and people. Doesn‚Äôt bother me none just like it didn‚Äôt when dems won 4 years ago and did the same thing, threw it in our faces the first 6 months after the election. Some of you really got a hard on for the orange dude, I don‚Äôt agree with everything but you all need to mind your own business and do something with your lives üòÇ
Because the Karens won't STFU that it should have been Madame ""Word Salad"" Kamala, that should be president. There are 4 years of retribution to be had.

They are in denial.¬† They see the chaos and refuse to accept that they didn't vote for all this bullshit.¬† Trump never said anything about Greenland, Canada, or almost anything he is actually doing.¬† And the stuff he promised to do?¬† He's made the economy worse.¬† ¬†Some people who voted for him can't admit they screwed up, so instead they double down, like a gambler at a casino who just lost his house.

The same reason people protest? People go out and advertise and show support for their parties/causes
It's a cult.
Because they are evil. Just like all the populations in history who loved and supported the worst authoritarian regimes. They are simply goners. Know the enemy.
um to be objective, it's to counter all the anti trump / anti musk / anti everything else that is also ramping up in volume lately. i see also people on bridges / overpasses holding all these signs like ""stop fascism"" etc.
Why the protests at Tesla? Same cult mentality
they are psychos
Probably the same reason people are trying to convince us to not support him. Nothing better to do ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Everybody needs to wake up all politicians are in it for them selves Dems and Rep fighting all about their parties not the people they represent. Tell me how you make 174,000 a year in congress and you are a multimillionaire.
Both sides hate you.  And they are all friends.  The Ants need to wake up already.  üòì
The election is over, lets move on.
There not many rural counties in NJ in the north. People here already feel a sense of pride being one of the rural counties of NJ. Now add a guy who claims he is ""the spokesperson of these people"" and is good at making these people feel wanted and heard leads to a cult.
Preparing for 2028 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
They‚Äôre cult followers. Like religion
Because that's what they've tied their identity to. Some people still have ones up from the previous election as well.
Attention. Period.
Because it's Sussex County.
Just to be clear, I see houses in Sussex County who do the same on the left. I have one house I pass during my commute everyday with rainbow flags, BLM banners, and Kamala/Walz banners all over their porch and front yard. During the peak of the election it was even more cluttered and looked just as ugly as the massive hordes of Trump signs that are admittedly more common in the area, but finding left-leaning nut jobs is not impossible. In Sussex County you're more likely to see left-leaning garbage on cars with bumper stickers as opposed to on their home property. 

Just remember both sides are a plague, and both are just as brainwashed as the other. Sussex County is just a rural county which leans right, and if you went elsewhere you could find the same neurotic obsession but with left-leaning content.
Because believe it or not it‚Äôs fun to piss other people off without having to pay any consequences.
Imagine what it must be like in bumblefuck alabama
TDS
Because they‚Äôve made it their personality.
Because‚Ä¶cult
Loser behavior
Because we love and support him. We are Americans for America.
I still have lots of flags up!

They are flags. Leave the jerks alone. They may have made a poor decision but it is what it is.
They fly the Trump flag like it's their entire culture and at this point it seems like it may be. Only ever seen the Puerto Rican flag flown as much as they throw a flag on everything.
Yep. And it makes them feel tough or better than someone else.
When you vote against your own interests solely to ‚Äúown the Libs‚Äú it‚Äôs pretty much over for you.
Seriously, nobody does this for any other politician. None. It's one thing in election season but it's been like this day in and day out since 2015.
mhm. and doubling down on it bc they can't admit they're hurt and dumb. big yikes.
Came here to say exactly this
It's the new-age confederate flag, except every idiot from everywhere, not just the south, can be proud to display ""their heritage"" with it.
Man, that come down is going to be rough.
and then they say it‚Äôs not a cult ü•∏
Bingo. We had a gaggle of loons protesting the mask mandates for covid etc LAST YEAR in my town. 

Perpetual victimhood and always needing a boogeyman. 

These people are 100% projection and are as soft as tissue paper otherwise
They have nothing else.
They're like fangirls for heaven's sake. It's weird.
Yup. It‚Äôs a cult
Cult of Personality
https://youtu.be/7xxgRUyzgs0?si=dcmb6dmpBz6mu98r
This is why it‚Äôs often described as a cult and trump as a cult of personality. It‚Äôs not about ideas it‚Äôs about the tasty coolaid
Exactly this.
Sounds like a cult
""Could?""
Not just winning the election, but ""owning the libs"".  The post election dopamine hit they got is wearing off so they need to go out and rub in more people's faces to make them feel better about themselves
I've said it before but I think it's more true than ever. The average MAGA would defend Trump if their child was raped by him. If their child came to them with incontrovertible proof they would blame their child rather than accept Trump's guilt.
Well to be fair, both sides entire existence is about winning. Hence why it's become a joke now.
Wow still don't get it, impressive.

My in-laws neighbor has a 9ft tall inflatable trump lawn decoration. It‚Äôs on every night.
It really is. I hav3 a coworker who every time she sees him stops and says, "" That's my president."" The first time I heard her say this, I said, ""But he's a criminal and sexually assaults women."" She said with a smile, ""So, everyone has their faults, that was in the past.""

What was weird about what she said is that one of her biggest fears is men assaulting her. She felt uncomfortable when a tech made a compliment about her eyes.
Last month, she reported a male coworker for what she took as flirting with her and now will no longer work with him.
But anything this president does, she puts on the biggest smile like she enamored.

It really is cult like.
Yep, was about to comment exactly this.
Yes.  It is really a cult.  I hope daily that the cool-aid mix can solve this pandemic...
Exactly.
This is my response every single time
It's a fascist cult, let's not forget.
75plus million votes isn't a cult sweetie
And they think Trump has a mandate. No one told them (at least no one they'd listen to) that less people voted for Trump than people who either didn't vote or voted for Harris.
Their whole thing about derangement syndrome is so idiotic since it ignores their responsibility in the insurrection. Which you could argue is one of many reasons why so many democrats are now ""deranged"" and legal gun owners, so good luck  ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚úåüèΩ
100% true. 

It's like those ""Let's Go Brandon"" stores. There's a reason they thrived mostly in the red areas of blue states (the chain got its start in Rhode Island). It was all about triggering the libs. 

This display is all, ""I see the protests and the news and they make me uncomfortable"".
Hey, I live in Sussex County and I think you‚Äôre giving these people way too much credit.  They‚Äôre all barely literate alcoholics.  Seriously, Sussex County is like a parallel universe.  The average age of a Sussex County resident is like 50 years old.  They all hangout at that Wawa to do the same thing they do every day.  Gawk at engines and try to inhale as many fumes as possible.
Good point
So do I but mine is more in the sense of fear and loathing
There's an animal sanctuary up in Sussex county called Skylands animal sanctuary in wantage. They are 100% Trump cult deranged lunatics. The owner's girlfriend drives around the property with Trump gear giving Biden the middle finger, cackling and posting about it. They're fucking sick clowns. Sussex is unhinged.
It‚Äôs like a daily nightly wet dream üõå for these folks!
They think about Trump during ‚Äúspecial potty playtime‚Äù as well
They get off injecting politics into every situation. Especially online.
Flies in and out to his Bedminster club to golf. He‚Äôs certainly not visiting the poors in Sussex.
There used to be a crazy lady in Fairfield near the Wawa whose yard was increasingly decked out in Trump batshittery until she got indicted for participating in the Jan 6 insurrection. Then, it all vanished and got replaced with a 'no trespassing' sign.
It‚Äôs insane.  There‚Äôs a house near me that has had Trump banners plastered on the front, top and bottom for years.  They put up fresh ones every few months.  It‚Äôs very North Korea-ish.
I know exactly which one you‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs so over the top.
I know that sign an hate it. i have a neighbor who had a bunch of trump signs and he took it down thank god
I mean he owns his golf course here. But I get what you‚Äôre trying to say that if they don‚Äôt pay the high cost of joining said golf course they wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near his presence.
I pass that house everyday lol. The house is falling apart but have money to put up those stupid signs.
I pass that one all the time and just shake my head
I know the sign you‚Äôre referring to. Funnily enough, just before the election, one of their neighbors had a sign in the yard that said ‚Äúcountry over party.‚Äù I have to imagine the two of them don‚Äôt like each other much.
I know this may sound crazy to you, but hear me out‚Ä¶ Trump‚Äôs got a golf course in New Jersey
I pass that one too, I think their neighbor had some anti Trump stuff up before the election. I feel bad for the neighbors.
Pass by that stupid banner every single day
Haha I pass this house every day on my way to work!! 

I hope the people who live there aren‚Äôt government workers‚Ä¶. ü§£
I pass that fucking dump every time I go to my dispensary
i see this sign everyday‚Ä¶ i live on 23 about 3 minutes south from that house üòï
Lol he is often in nj. His golf course is 15 mins from my home
Because they are stupid and have the brains of an illiterate.
I DO remember going to gun shows in PA and seeing targets with Obama on them for sale. A lot of them even had Hitler mustaches on his face. This inbred fuckery has been around for a while. They didn't have their own social media echo chambers at the time to send them into the mainstream, though.
They know doing this shit pisses off people who don't support Trump, and *that's why they do it*.  Because they are small, ignorant, unsuccessful people.
Elon is only smart enough to tell Trump he rigged it for him so Trump now thinks he owes him one. Elon is just a fucking dumb as Trump is.
I think the word you‚Äôre looking for is bought.
We got those types down here in Hunterdon County too!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòè
The lack of critical thinking up here is mind boggling. It‚Äôs only getting worse.
Are you forgetting about Warren County? lol
idk man I live here and I've traveled to some placers where I felt things might actually be worse. Or maybe this is just the devil I know.
Sussex County and Warren County are literally a part of Appalachia. Like the trail runs through there and everything. It's no surprise to me that it's culturally more like West Virginia up there.
This is a big one. It‚Äôll be a cold day in hell before my parents ever admit they were wrong about something so they‚Äôll just keep doubling down.
This
I even saw one in Montclair.  Mont. Clair.
üòÜüòèü§£
Sussex Countian here, kindly fuck off with your ignorance thank you.
Holy Shit. WTF is wrong with these assholes?!? Do they not have ONE other thing to do with their spare time????
They‚Äôre probably counter-protesting all the Qrump/Elmo protests.
Wait - is that the guy with the sign that said ‚Äúreport all illegals even at school, church‚Ä¶‚Äù with the Daddy‚Äôs Home and other nauseating signs?
That guy is insane!! I went to petsmart and saw the signs and gagged. 3 hours later, they changed the signs. It seems they rotate them everyday. üò≠üòÇ
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the people that live in that house that hold those ‚Äúrallies‚Äù at Ross‚Äôs corner.
Oh yeah! He has those plastic letter signs (that girls would put in their rooms). F, J and B. he has them lit up in his windows. House looks like it's falling apart but he has money for plastic light up letter and tons of signs - plus the ""smile! you're on camera!"" sign.

I usually flip it off as I drive by - hopefully the camera picks that up.
Ooh, I‚Äôll have to take that way home after my Dr appointment on Wednesday!
i almost broke my tv watching that, the entire thing was beyond enraging.  the level of deception inflicted upon those poor children is nothing less than insidious.
There's a guy in Sparta, on Stanhope Rd.,  who proudly flew his ""I'm voting for the Felon"" flag as close too the road as humanly possible....then switched it out to a new flag the day after the election.

I guess egg prices aren't a concern for him with all his 'flag money'.
I‚Äôm up in Sussex county too . It‚Äôs worse now than ever.
I‚Äôm here now. Can confirm, it‚Äôs still terrible
Same and I still live here. So disappointing seeing people you went to hs with supporting this type of cult shit. Not suprised tho. I hate saying I‚Äôm from here so I like to add a sly little ‚ÄúSussex county, unfortunately‚Äù when talking to people.
When he starts getting his benefits cut maybe he‚Äôll feel like a jerk. Probably wouldn‚Äôt admit to anyone and suffer in silence so he can still drink the koolade.
But shouldn‚Äôt they be tired of winning by now?
I count Sussex as part of Pennsylvania.
This!
Honestly I think about doing this every time I see them. I would absolutely be willing to do this. If we get enough people to show up let‚Äôs do it!!! The more people we have the safer everyone will feel. We could even do a protest the following day on Sunday when they aren‚Äôt there just to take their spot.
For real please
No! Not everyone!
Not everyone.
Just to clarify there were people currently there holding signs and flags. They put these flags up all over and on their cars too.
[removed]
This is the first time I‚Äôve considered the cult description possibly accurate.
Ross's Corner Rt. 15 / 206 / 565.
They are not in Wawa. They are in a park and ride. What's said is seeing them indoctrinate their kids into the cult.
Accurate
They don‚Äôt like Nazis?
Hahahahahaha. Guess we know what signs you have in your yard.
Why do Republicans suddenly love electric vehicles?
Well, that 2 term thing is only a part of The Constitution and Trump and every one of his minions uses that for toilet paper.
Wait, so when Trump supporters were ‚Äúrallying‚Äù for the past 4 years at parking lots selling flags and hats carrying signs, putting FJB and Joe and the Hoe stickers all over their cars, flying flags off their shitty pickup trucks, rolling coal on teslas and iceing out electrics at charging stations‚Äî- alll that wasn‚Äôt outright protesting??? Are you serious.. I‚Äôm not making any of that up, I watched incidents over and over for the past 4 years‚Ä¶ so democrats organize a few protests and y‚Äôall are quaking so hard that ya need to call them crazy or deranged and start flying your banners again‚Ä¶ wow
Do you think worshipping an elected official and protesting are different sides of the same coin? Oh boy. I‚Äôm beginning to think that Trump derangement syndrome has a second meaning‚Ä¶

Forming a cult around an elected official is amongst the least American things I can think of while protesting is absolutely in the birth pains of this country.
If you think it‚Äôs fun to strip the rights and civil liberties of minorities there might be something seriously wrong with your sense of empathy.
Except he's literally selling what it means to be American. It's now something you can just simply buy instead of becoming one. Kinda cheapens it.
That sounds like something a cultist would say.
You sound like the kind of American that gave diseased blankets to the Native Americans and rationalized the Tuskegee Experiment. We are not the same.
Hows those grocery prices doin? And the stock market? And the 401K?

Hows building resorts on Gaza making America great again? Who pays for the tariffs? How are other countries boycotting American products because of tariffs helping America? How does a peaceful president all sudden threaten to annex Canada and Greenland? 

How is tax cuts for corporations and billionaires making America great again?

How is lowering funding on Medicare and Medicaid and trying to cut down Social Security help people? How is there nothing for no taxes on overtime or tips on the bill they passed but also increase government spending by 2 trillion help people?

But your Fox News tell you otherwise and you believe everything they tell you.
Puerto Ricans on the island don't do this, btw. It's just the ones here in the continental US who've probably never stepped foot on the island, let alone a plane. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Yea, it‚Äôs ridiculous. You don‚Äôt see people building their identity around hating Trump.
Actually, people from Maryland put their flag on EVERYTHING. But TBH, it is kind of cool üòÇ
Nothing says tough better than having a meltdown over hearing the word trans or Julianne Moore writing a children‚Äôs book about having red hair and loving yourself for it.

Couldn‚Äôt that be said for the opposite group as well? Two sides to the same coin
He‚Äôs everything to them. Imagine being that full of moral squalor?
It‚Äôs honestly so crazy to me. I don‚Äôt care about anyone this much, not least of all a politician. I just can‚Äôt fathom being such a cuck for someone I‚Äôve never even met and who has no idea who I even am.
It‚Äôs a cult‚Ä¶ same as Hitler early in the ‚Äò30‚Äôs, calling the media illegal and criminal bc they tell the truth, spell out facts, or generally disagree with his rhetoric.
Surely you've never seen my Walter Mondale collection
Pretty sure there‚Äôs a fair share of Putin propaganda in Russia üòÇ

Rough like that massive heart attack these fat old fucks will get
Business Insider today put out an article about the whiny Trump voters who lost their federal jobs. ""This isn't what I voted for!!"" Ummm yes, you did, he made very clear what DOGE was going to do months before the election, and you still voted for him. Dummies.

Exactly!
I was thinking the same thing‚Ä¶ Shit is already happening.
It's more like

- republicans actively making everything worse just to get a ""win"" over the democrats

- democrats doing nothing other than being ""not republicans"" and shutting down any attempts at actual change from the left

It's no wonder Trump dominated 2024.
Nobody regretted it lol‚Ä¶ he WAS the better option, even if he was a mediocre president.

It‚Äôs like choosing between a stale peanut butter sandwich and a heaping pile of shit.  You can tell me how gross the sandwich is all day - but given the option, it‚Äôs better than the heaping pile of shit.
One, I didn't regret it. Politics always has ups and downs.

Two, I did not see this much ""support"" and unending jeering when Biden was elected. I know you will counter that with something childish, but the actual difference is whatever people disliked or regretted about Biden they were willing to ADMIT it. 

I don't think anybody said Biden was the perfect option, I certainly didn't. What actually mattered was that it was Biden or Trump after a while. And when Biden won, I didn't stand outside and yell about how Conservatives needed to cry and how they were fucking babies and deserved to be kicked out.

Can you at least understand that?
>Biden

>the left

lol
God I hope it rains thumb tacks tomorrow.
I wish I could post a pic of the neighbor around the block from me who had a giant inflatable Santa trump. It was disturbing looking
Oh my, I'd be tempted to get some darts or a BB gun or scissors late at night...
I wonder what would happen if a random pin just happened to pop it
LMAO please provide a picture, I need to see it
I'd have nightmares.
Cult and delusional people who think that if something isn‚Äôt happening to them personally it isn‚Äôt happening
It‚Äôs called being ignorant, racist and moronic.
Anything she complains about, say it was the past. Grab her ass and say, ""it's just a fault of mine and it's in the past"" woops.

You‚Äôre right, they admitted to lying so the number was a bit smaller. The ones who voted are still in a cult tho
Why? Is there a cap on the amount of members a cult can have?
What's the upper limit on cult?
Both Trump and Kamala got more than 75 million votes.
Not everyone who voted for Trump carries around signs with his name on them like these cultists do. These freaks make up a tiny percentage of the people who voted for him.
Someone in the local Nextdoor group claimed that ‚Äúa majority of the country‚Äù voted for the orange asshat.  I was going to ask her to show her work , like in math class, but knowing it would be pointless, I just hid her posts instead.
While that statistic sounds really cool at first, it turns out to be the case with like every other presidential election for more than 30+ years, so it's not something I'd really brag about. Matter of fact you don't even have to consider the votes for the main opponent. Non voters always exceed winning party voters. Cool idea though, and it gave me something interesting to investigate. Bottom line is that it's shameful how few eligible voters actually participate.
I live in Warren county and the similarities oh I can‚Äôt breathe. üò©ü§£
The ""cruisers"" in the Newton Mall parking lot crack me up! They have these blinged out muscle cars of yesteryear, which are quite honestly beautiful cars, but then you see them get out of their car with a walker with tennis balls on the legs, just to sit in their folding chairs, trying not to die.....and NOBODY is there to look at their cars...it's just them, sitting next to their own cars with the hoods up drinking Metamucil out of their Yetis!!! HAHAHAHA! I'm like, nah bro, I'm just trying to get shit-bags for my dog at PetCo, I don't care about your General Lee replica with a V8 that gets 2 miles a gallon that you can no longer hear because you're fucking deaf now!
Fear and Loathing in DC
At first I thought you were referring to Space Farms but using the wrong name. The description of the owners sounds similar.
Yeah and they jerk off to it.
The worst is when it‚Äôs not the poors. I can‚Äôt imagine paying a million+ for a house and decorating it in Trump shit.
Nor is he making their lives fucking great.  Are their grocery prices down ? Do any of them take Medicaid or SSI?  It‚Äôs insane.
Good-I hope the orange felon stays away from Sussex.
My neighbor still displays his pro-drumpf election sign, but now he has added no trespassing signs and ‚Äúyou are being watched‚Äù camera signs. Hah hah.
The ""no trespassing"" sign is hilarious.
It's ridiculous! I'm willing to bet money whoever lives there bitches and moans about the cost of living in New Jersey; but was willing to cough up potentially hundreds of dollars for their orange lord and savior.
That's because they buy the signs from China. Probably AliExpress. Get'em real cheap. Well not for long thankfully. üòÇ
I'm ngl I completely forgot about his golf course when I made that comment. However it still doesn't change the fact that he's not going to visit Sussex County
My point is he's never going to visit Sussex Countu specifically.
It doesn‚Äôt piss me off. It give me second hand embarrassment
I don‚Äôt think Elon is dumb. He got the president ( in his 3rd country) to hand him the keys. Yes, Trump IS that dumb I agree. Elon is evil and wants this all to himself. He looks dumb for sure, but Doge didn‚Äôt just fall in his lap‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a sick mofo

How is Hunterdon on the Trump loving scale? I have a friend who says that Hunterdon has gotten less conservative since I moved out in the late 2000s. But they voted for Trump, so I suspect our perception on this could differ.
Nope, that‚Äôs why I said some of and not just the most lol
Same and same lol
Yes the 500k+ plus home paying 12-15k in taxes in Knowlton/Blairstown is way more like West Virginia than anything in NJ. ¬†They even shoot squirrel, wash their clothes in the Delaware River, and play the banjos on their front porch! ¬†Give me a break. ¬†I‚Äôm all for hyperbole when used in humor this is just ludicrous. ¬†
Saw a Montclair for Trump sign in front of a huge mansion which at least makes sense as he helps the rich get richer. No idea why working and lower class people think he is helping them
I feel like because that area is very affluent you will see Trump signs, though not as many as in places like Sussex County. I live in Union County and I see those signs in Berkley Heights, Summit, Scotch Plains, and Cranford.
there's a bunch in chester as well.
Was in ShopRite of Nutley yesterday. Older gentlemen with a MAGA hat and a youngish woman with a Trump t-shirt.
I was raised there for most of my life i know not everyone is terrible there but man there are some stinkers
yep. apparently trump replaced santa last year too.
yeah been like that since 2016...always rotating through the propaganda of the day.
I flip off every house with the Drumpf decor when I go by.  It‚Äôs exhausting some days.
Yea I live in the poconos now, so it's not much better here. I went to lenape valley highschool though, so not even the worst of Sussex county, but still enough of my old friends have gone to the dark side.


I remove them from social media now.¬†
Why don't you move to beautiful Newark or Patterson so you can live with all the wonderful people ,there all the blue voters. You should get out of Sussex County. It's so terrible to live here. Camden might also be a nice place for you.
I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm applying it to their love of not a party or an ideology, but of one man and his dogma.¬†
Lmao that's not the own you think it is and you're literally proving everybody's point that trumpies are a cult
I live in West Milford which has voted roughly 70/30 for Trump in the past 3 elections.  While not every Trump voter falls into the cult category, I'd say close to half of them do.  I've seen the change in the past 10 years in some of my own friends and family.  In 2016, it was ""we're tired of politicians and want something different.""  I watched these people begin defending Trump's words and actions that they previously would have considered reprehensible.  Fast forward to 2024, many of these people have Trump flags hanging on their homes year-round.  They post exclusively about Trump to the point they alienate their loved ones.  They change their profile pictures to Trump himself.

Now, when they are confronted with examples of him lying, or evidence that his plans are going to harm them personally, to admit that is to admit that they were duped.  So instead they have to dig in deeper, going even further down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories or pretending he has some grand vision that we're all just too dumb to understand.  Classic cult stuff.
Ok? I‚Äôm not debating any politics, just stating why people put signs up to answer OPs question. There seemed to be some confusion that only one side can put signs up
i'm not saying that nobody should be protesting for what they believe in, but saying if one group does, why not the other? I think this whole post is weird in the first place. My comment was basically a ""well if you call that out, here call this out too"". Love the downvotes, i guess this sub isn't a location specific one but a left safe space :P
How many fences like this have you seen covered in ""I hate Trump"" flag??
Red hair AND FRECKLES! üò±

Wait, they freaked out over this kind of children's book?!?
DoD is censoring 'Enola Gay' because word. How snowflakey is *that*??
Imagine using NJ Trans...it.
Literally no. Find me a single human being still repping Kamala. Go ahead.
Imagine being that *empty* that this appeals to you.
thats their daddy as they say
It‚Äôs worse. It‚Äôs an inability to see through his con and lies.
No politician in my lifetime or my parents' lifetimes have generated this kind of 24/7 365 excitement in this country or many others. Because this isn't normal human behavior. And don't dare say he isn't normal, he's just another crook businessman entering politics for personal gain. People like him are a dime a dozen, he just doesn't pretend to be respectable. Whereas some other crook politician might apologize for bragging about being a sexual predator he doubles down on it. That's all. Nothing special. You can find one of those guys every Friday night at a shitty comedy club or dive bar.
As we say in our house, ‚ÄúHave the day you voted for‚Äù.

You should look into the ""Rain"" comic by Joe Hill! That's kind of the premise.
I mean Trump isn‚Äôt an attractive man to begin with.  He‚Äôs like anti-charismatic.
I must have missed the rallies and the lawn decor. 

Being proud of having a black president with this countries history is much different than what op is describing
Example?
Wow news to me! I thought that they didn‚Äôt need a limit! /s if it wasn‚Äôt obvious lol.
It ain't that damn Tiny. No president in my lifetime has had so much merch...not even close.
Disagree. I don't know many people who voted for him - but the ones that did will find \*any\* way to bring his name up. No matter the conversation, they gotta get their king's name out of their mouth. 

That's a cult.
[deleted]
I do that too now, I realized it's not worth arguing with them and it's not worth having them know my name or the neighborhood where I live. I had my Harris/Walz sign stolen off my lawn last October.

 We can also report people on Nextdoor it if we want, there isn't supposed to be national politics on the website.
Because of the exhaust fumes?
lol but they have all these trump, arms paintings inside the hoods.. such a waste of talent. Also fuck that whole parking lot. Whoever designed it should have to drive around it all day long every day.
There is an age where doing tough guy stuff just stops looking cool and these guys have hit it.  I got stuck behind one of those old people biker gangs on 519 the other day and there was an ambulance following at the very end and I just have to assume it was there to scoop up all the old bikers that have heart attacks or complications from diabetes.
""We can't stop here... This is Trump country""
They're all the same Maga dirtbags in the end.
Near me, it tends to be the largest, nicest houses that are all tricked out in the Drumpf crap.
A Trump bible for every room in the house!

I think the problem is that on the surface many conservatives act as though what democrats do is new. I spend a lot of time reading r/conservative and see SO many posts saying ‚Äúlibs are doing x, WE would never do such a thing, would we?‚Äù When I have seen real life examples on my own street of conservatives doing that very thing. Everyone blew up when Al Green got kicked out of Trump‚Äôs speech as democrats were acting so disgracefully. When the republicans did it in Biden‚Äôs speeches - just watch Marjorie Taylor Green boo him‚Ä¶ and his first state of the union. Y‚Äôall act like your shit doesn‚Äôt stink and you claim we have Trump derangement syndrome or trump Elon derangement syndrome but in your own echo chambers the derangement is worse.

It was, like every modern presidential election, decided by a few thousand votes in swing states.

The fact is the corporate-sponsored parties and their co-conspirators in the media choose who gets to be considered a Serious Candidate, and what the very narrow range of acceptable-to-have political opinions are, and then voters choose from that menu. Many people find that horribly uninspiring and don't see a point in it, and so they stay home. ""Record turnout"" in this country is ~60% of eligible voters bothering to participate.
I ran into him at a Knicks game when I was 10.... that guy creeped me out even back then. The whole vibe around him is off.
It was everywhere back then.  People wore it on their faces and clothing.  You just don't remember.  We have a 2 party system in the country.  It's to hedge extremism on both sides, and extremism on both sides exists.  At some point, the tides will shift again left and back right and so on and why tyranny never gains traction here
Sure, if you were being honest about their behavior. But you're not. The behavior that we're talking about right now does actually make them freaks.
It's more like masterbation. As the definition says, ""Masturbation is a normal and healthy sexual activity. However, excessive masturbation can lead to certain health and psychological issues. ""

So, liking someone is fine, every once in a while, like batin. Liking someone 24/7 where it's affecting your daily life, activities, and productivity is too much, ALSO Like masterbation! See the connection?

They might not be satisfied with your answer or mine due to typical cult following behavior:

Dehumanizing Rhetoric: Referred to immigrants as ""animals,"" ""savages,"" and ""predators""; compared opponents to ""vermin.""

Suppression of Dissent: Detained activists like Mahmoud Khalil for political speech.

Attacks on Media: Defunded and shut down Voice of America (VOA) to silence unfavorable coverage.

Defiance of Judicial Orders: Continued deportation flights despite court rulings against them.

Use of Political Violence: Encouraged supporters to attack opponents and downplayed violent actions.

Undermining Democracy: Attempted to overturn election results and spread disinformation.

Expert Warnings: Figures like John Kelly and Kamala Harris described Trump as fascist or authoritarian.

07 Ford Focus Drivers Door Handle Broken - Where in NNJ/CNJ can I get this fixed?,"I've owned this car since Nov '22 and so far its been pretty reliable. The door handle has always been a little stiff though - sometimes it took more than one pull to open. 



One day back in november 2024 I pulled the door handle a little too hard and something inside audibly snapped. I bought what I thought to be an acceptable replacement from [carparts.com](http://carparts.com) and brought to a shop to fix. 



I first called a caliber collision near me but they said they wouldn't work with on a vehicle with a part they didnt purchase themselves. I was recommended by them to another shop down the street.



This shop was able to take the door apart and add the new handle, but there was some piece missing (guy described as a grommet). Guy said he would order the part and get back to me only to let me know it was unavailable wherever he had searched.

So as of right now, though the handle pulls, the car door still cannot open. 07 focuses arent remote operated and the only key entry is the drivers side door. I either have to keep my passenger door open at all times or crawl through my trunk to get inside.

  
Is there any shop in northern or central nj (preferably nnj) that could assist with fixing my door? any recommendations would be very much appreciated ",0.4,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jd0f7e/07_ford_focus_drivers_door_handle_broken_where_in/,1,1jd0f7e,2025-03-17 00:43,"Not that hard to do yourself I would think.

You will pass at DMV provided you haven't screwed with anything emissions related on your car and it isn't throwing codes\check engine light.

A cop can still write you a ticket for the bad windshield though.
You should pass, they only check the check engine light codes plus sometimes the emissions gear.

"$822 for a tow from accident, not even held overnight. Legal?","Father in law was in an accident Sunday morning, was taken to hospital. Not his fault. Police contracts with private tow companies to clear road. Private tow hooked the car, which was not drivable anyway. I don‚Äôt know how damaged the car was but I don‚Äôt think it was extensive, but can‚Äôt be sure if special equipment needed. Not a huge heavy car, it‚Äôs a dodge caravan. 

It‚Äôs been 12 hours, finally get them to tell me they have the car. Can‚Äôt pick up on Sunday anyway. Current charges are $821.95, goes up $43/day (which seems relatively modest). 

I‚Äôm from nyc where there are lower limits on tow fees. And obviously tow companies are not exactly angels. 

Is this typical/legal?",0.89,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jczyy4/822_for_a_tow_from_accident_not_even_held/,47,1jczyy4,2025-03-17 00:21,"His insurance company should pay for it
That‚Äôs insanely high. I didn‚Äôt even pay half that when my car was towed during a state of emergency for a snow storm. I hate the predatory companies these police departments use.
Here is a good resource. https://www.njta.com/media/7366/tpk-towing-rates_03-20-2023.pdf

$43 is the negotiated rate for Turnpike so comparatively this isn‚Äôt high.

Depends on the wrecker they sent out. Sounds like Class II which is probably $250-$300. Probably charging $5-$6 a mile. $200-$300 for storage. If any fluid leak they will charge a hazmat cleanup. 

$812 sounds on par
Seems a little higher side but the tow company sets the fees. Insurance should pay for it though. Call your insurance company. They‚Äôll straighten it out.
Tow companies who tow for police are covered by township ordinances sometimes.  The prices are usually set by ordinance.  See if you can find it.
Insurance will handle it if car is totaled anyway
Seems really high, but if it happened on the turnpike or parkway, only certain wreckers are permitted to operate. They could be much more expensive, plus perhaps Sunday rates. 

Either way, insurance should cover it.
What's the towing company called
Yeah they did this to me. I was rear ended, my car was not drivable due to the safety fuse blowing which cuts the fuel pump in an accident. I went to have my car towed to BMW the following morning to get the repairs started and was hit with a $900 bill. They were even trying to get me to leave the car there so that the insurance could pay an even higher price‚Ä¶.tow companies can be extremely predatory.
Insurance should be paying it without a doubt.
Get AAA.

My cars battery died last summer. AAA was taking too long so the cop called his guy to take it a half mile. Charged my like $175, the tow guy said AAA will cover it. They sent me a check in like 2 weeks.
Name of towing company?
Every municipality outlines how much tow companies can charge if operating in their district. You can find this info on the ordinances (which are publicly available) on the municipality‚Äôs website. You can compare this against your bill and use it to argue it down.

If you already paid it‚Äôs too late for that - can‚Äôt get any money back.
Wow! That price is outrageous. What kind of vehicle was it? You should definitely ask for a breakdown of the costs and have the insurance reimburse you for this. Also, check if these prices are common practice; if they're not, you can report this to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the Attorney General's office. They are required by law to provide a price sheet and rate information.
Similar thing happened to me last Sunday of the year. I got stuck on a small boulder leaving a parking lot and was in the middle of calling a tow, when the Chatham police told me they couldn‚Äôt wait for the tow I was getting to come because I was partially blocking traffic (I wasn‚Äôt) so I had to use *their* tow from in town. So their tow comes, guy says it‚Äôs 400 cash only, plus holding charges if I can‚Äôt take it home before they close. (Of course I didn‚Äôt have it on me but at least they drove me to an ATM so there‚Äôs that.) My own tow would‚Äôve been free and there in not quite an hour. Police made me feel like I had no choice but to get ripped off.
100% this.
Exactly why its so high - you can literally call them and be like look , im paying for repairs out of pocket and not doing insurance and they will drop it to like $300
You must be insanely high too. I bet your car had 4 wheels and didn‚Äôt need to be dragged by chains up a flatbed either.
This is accurate. I would also suggest contacting your insurance and making them aware of the cost. They will attempt to recover it from the at fault party‚Äôs insurance company. Sadly, you‚Äôll more than likely need to pay out of pocket for immediate recovery :/
Incredible racket. Wow.
And it was on route 1-9 in north Bergen / Secaucus area.
Thats not true, the municipality that the towing company is working for sets the rates.
This is correct. And some of those same tow companies work for aaa and get the same calls in. Guess which one pays 3x
‚ÄúMain Towing Company‚Äù
The father in law was being taken to the hospital.. can't really call AAA from a hospital bed. Also if the accident was on a highway you pretty much get whoever gets there first.
John‚Äôs Main Auto
Which is why it's so high. Insurance pays the full amount and the towing company makes out like bandits. Even if they pay half, that's still stupid money for ~15 minutes' work.
Some cars can only be towed on flatbeds, regardless of damage.
Do‚Ä¶do you have a car with less than 4 wheels?
You‚Äôre getting someone on call to respond to an emergency scene on a highway and clear the roadway as fast as possible. It‚Äôs a dangerous job.
Seems about right for a legit insured licensed company to have someone on call to respond to your accident at a moment's notice Tell your car and clean the highway while performing a job that is considered one of the most dangerous jobs in America. But yeah the $800 is too much maybe you should tell your relative to not get an accidents
Whatever you think. But fees are set by the private tow company for accidents and cannot exceed amounts as specified by the state.
John‚Äôs Main auto? Around Union city?
lol. If it rolls, it ain‚Äôt that expensive‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs the point,
I had a car with three wheels after an accident once. That needed a flatbed lol
22 people missed the part where wheels get get torn off or bent in accidents.

Things get bent, mangled, smashed, destroyed. 

So judging based off the price of the tow, explanation from op, and general common sense of the way the world works.‚Ä¶ op‚Äôs vehicle probably had damage that warranted ‚Äúspecial equipment‚Äù which describes ANYTHING that isn‚Äôt a regular hook and tow. 
Also, a flatbed isn‚Äôt REQUIRED for an awd vehicle.
It‚Äôs RECOMMENDED. 

You can very well use a wrecker with wheel Dollie‚Äôs. 

I forgot everyone in NJ knows EVERYTHING.

A little bit of common sense and humility goes a long way.
I have a tow truck.
I‚Äôm not saying a man can‚Äôt get paid. 

But they hold your property hostage and have you by the balls at a time when folks might be hospitalized, disabled, unable to work. The nature of the thing invites predatory behavior.

Edit: I‚Äôll add that the accident wasn‚Äôt FIL‚Äôs fault, some dude drove the wrong way through a one-way and tboned him.
Come on .. you know it's a racket. I bet if you were the one being hit with $900 fee that you'd be singing a different tune..

Unless you work in towing then you'll get the friends and family discount, right? Hah.
We got Downvoted because the people in this sub are on meth. 
Apparently using your brain is a thing of the past in NJ. 

Everything you said is accurate and makes sense to the people who actually understand the way of the world. 

800$ is CHEAP for an emergency police tow. 

Imagine finding out a tow down the street when the car rolls, goes into gear and has 0 damage is 240-350$! 

Heads may roll!
I worked for a towing company for 8 years and we did police towing. The town sets the rates for the hook, storage, clean ups, admin fee - everything. So that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs really funny when people complain about the towing company being predatory or whatever, go talk to your town board cause they‚Äôre the ones setting the rates.
I believe so
You're the only one acting like you know everything, dude.
Nobody is holding your property hostage. 

If you did not have a place for them to transport and store the vehicle on your own, yard, driveway, collision center, etc.., then you need a place to drop it and store it until it goes to said collision center, driveway, etc‚Ä¶

If you don‚Äôt have one then it gets brought to the impound lot. Stored at a fixed rate that is regulated by the state. And charged for the milage and equipment used for the tow. 

So yeah, you don‚Äôt get access to it until you pay. 

What does the towing company get if you decide you don‚Äôt wanna pay and they let you take your car? 

Holding your car is security for services rendered.
If you do not pay or pickup your vehicle, a title is requested from the dmv by the towing company.. You no longer own your vehicle and it‚Äôs about to get sold for way more than whatever the price of the tow was.
Nobody asked if we had a place to store it (we do), nobody gave us the option to call our own tow (we have AAA). 

I understand that there isn‚Äôt time to mess around and ya gotta get the road clear because we supposedly still live in a society where at least the average folks have regard for their fellow citizens and ppl need to get on with their day. 

But don‚Äôt tell me they aren‚Äôt holding this man‚Äôs property hostage. Oh wait, you actually agree with me when you say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt get access to your car until you pay‚Äù [for the services you didn‚Äôt contract for].
I should have been on the phone with who? My FIL was alone, unconscious, at the scene. EMS called my wife after the fact so we could get to the hospital. 

I guess you enjoy lecturing folks about stuff like this when they are at their lowest. Instead of the mindset of ‚ÄúI suffered through it, so should the next guy, it builds character‚Äù, maybe we should figure out a better way that doesn‚Äôt put the victim in a hole even deeper than the one they already find themself. 

Im not disagreeing over the importance to get the scene cleared efficiently (see earlier reply). I am simply remarking that this system is:

(1) putting the entire financial burden on the victim, 

(2) a transaction that wasn‚Äôt negotiated other than perhaps between tow lobbyists and politicians setting the statutory rates, and

(3) ripe for predatory behavior. 

It‚Äôs a social and political choice being made, just interesting to me how those moments where society says ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs a tough break, but you gotta take one for the team‚Äù usually falls hardest on the average joe.
And that‚Äôs the thing right‚Ä¶..

As you‚Äôve noticed, not everyone comprehends the things they read or listen to properly. The same goes for people listening and comprehending the police. 

It is not the police or tow operators responsibility to inform you of these things. It is their duty to manage, mitigate, and resolve the incident at hand. Efficiently. 
You are not going to be waited on to have the vehicle removed from the road and cleaned up. 

The person driving/owner of said vehicle is responsible for making on scene officials aware of their requests. They are not going to take the time to ask you what your preferred towing company is. 

You should have been on the phone with them before the police arrived. 

Stopping to have a conversation about the options you aren‚Äôt aware of in the middle of a highway is not one of them and never will be. 

I know it sounds like I‚Äôm being a dick but this is reality.

Use this as a lesson to have a plan in place god forbid another mva happens. 

I‚Äôve had my fair share of being smacked into because some kid is on vacation having a blast at 50mph in the right turn lane with a packed car. 


I‚Äôve always had my vehicle towed with and to the company and location of my choosing, so long as said business is open or has given consent for the vehicle to be delivered/stored. 

Yes using your own tow will lower cost (sometimes depending on circumstances of accident) 
Yes, you can have it shoved in your back yard if you so please (so long as local ordinance does not prohibit vehicles being stored)

Out of town guests- restaurant reqs,"I just moved to Jersey and my sister and her kids will be up here next week for a track meet. 

They‚Äôll be staying in Bayonne, I‚Äôm in Somerville. She put me in charge of finding a good restaurant but my idea of ‚Äúgood restaurant‚Äù as a single woman with no kids and hers- where we have to make sure the kids will actually eat something and she does let have to pay $50 for them to only take 3 bites is different. 

Im thinking something in Jersey city/Hoboken with good views but the few places that look great to me are less than appealing to her kiddos. 

Any ideas?

If they want to try a classic diner then go to Broadway Diner or The Lighthouse Diner.
Look for a diner with good reviews or just ask what kind of food they eat, specifically the kids. Ask where do they normally eat out at?
Take them to Harold  NY deli in Edison the kids will get a kick out of the size of the food.
What area? Around Bayonne? Or somewhere in between
Theres little in JC / Hoboken will have a good view and be reasonably priced and kid friendly. The only place I can think of would be Surf City if the weathers nice since it‚Äôs mostly outdoors. It‚Äôs very kid friendly with nice views but I‚Äôd check the menu to make sure there‚Äôs something for everyone. And it has easy parking. Otherwise heres a few reasonably priced and kid friendly spots in Jersey City with good food. I‚Äôd recommend El Ranchero for Mexican. Rumba Cubana for Cuban. White Star bar (both locations) for basic bar food - my cousins 6 yr old was happy here. Stadium pizza is imo the best pizzeria in JC and has great cheesesteaks too. The beer garden is super kid friendly but the food is mid.

Sounds like the inspector didn't go on the roof? It's there in front but the only real way to determine if it's also on the sides, is to look under the gap of the siding, which should also be trimmed a little bit better than it currently. It's probably there.
Should step flashing be marked NSFW?
There probably is none. We are currently dealing with a roof that is newish and leaking because there was no flashing installed when the previous owner refused(and signed off) flashing. Multiple roofers are saying it's common that the houses don't have it in that location. We are about to pay $11,500 for a new roof to do it right.

NJM insurance increase following traffic ticket,"I got my first traffic ticket for unsafe vehicle operation (45 in a 30), pled to a lesser offense and paid the fees. Got a letter in the mail from NJM yesterday saying my premium is increasing by $140. Genuine question, what is the logic in I thought I would‚Äôve escaped the premium increase.

Any thoughts/advice welcome.",0.47,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jcxqit/njm_insurance_increase_following_traffic_ticket/,23,1jcxqit,2025-03-16 22:35,"insurance companies treat all violations as a premium increase, including no point ones.
because your insurance doesn't care about points. They care about the fact that you committed a moving violation. That (likely) increases your risk when they run you through their models, which in turn increases what premiums you need to pay so you now find a place in them.

That is, on the most fundamental level, how insurance works.
You escape the motor vehicle points, but not the insurance points.
In 2025, my NJM premium went up $296, or 13.6% versus 2024. No change in car, no change in policy coverage, and no incidents whatsoever. 

So, it might not only be your claim.
It's just corporate greed. Any excuse to raise rates
My NJM insurance premium is almost double within two years. Added home insurance last week which game me $200.00 relief.
My husband didn't avoid the points and ours went up by about $500, so could have been worse.
Insurance carriers are *not supposed* to raise rates for 'non moving' violations, since they carry 0 points.   
  
This is seldom followed though, any guilty plea for a title 39 offense will show up on your abstract, and virtually anything that shows up on your abstract will affect your premium.
Who ever convinced you to plead to unsafe did you a disservice. 
Your first 2 point speeding ticket is waived from assessment by insurance carriers in the state of NJ.
Some insurance companies look more favorable to first time offender than others. I would ship around with the help of a broker.  They can shop around multiple quotes with different companies.
Remember you have NJM so rate is less than other companies. Imagine if that was State Farm üôÑ
Ugh that‚Äôs frustrating, do you think it‚Äôs worth even making an effort to talk to them about lowering it or is it a lost cause
Got it. Thanks for the insight- I knew about the potential of it increasing, I guess I thought first offense wouldn‚Äôt be that pricey. Do you think it‚Äôs worth making a move to even discuss the increase with them or is it not worth it at all
Ugh, what a bummer. I guess I should‚Äôve known. Insurance shows no mercy
Was going to say this. Everyone‚Äôs insurance seems to be going wild and I read that‚Äîdue to the tarriffs‚Äô impact on replacement parts‚Äîwe can expect it to get worse
Carriers in NJ were granted approval for 2 rate increases in 2024, one carrier got an approval for a 19% increase followed some months later by another approval for a 34% increase. 

I'm sure NJM was right around those figures as well. 

All increases are governed by the state, just like our 20%  electricity rate increase coming up in July.
My insurance goes up because of ""inflation"" even with 0 violations. I try to switch every time my insurance is about to expire, but it's getting ridiculous.   
I suppose part of the problem is how bad our drivers are and the fact everyone is driving $50k+ cars now.
You can't talk to a computer.  All of this shit is based off metrics, there's no beating it.
The lowering the ticket to a no points violation is towns taking advantage of people's gullability to grab court fees on top of the violation.

The only way it makes sense is if you already have so many points you are in danger of suspension.

As others have said insurance sees a violation either way.
Depends on who your insurance company is, what kind of policy you have with them, what other business you do with them, how long you have been with them, etc.  

Only your agent can know. You aren't going to get them to ""lower"" your insurance, because it isn't them spitballing a price. Its an insanely complex algorithm looking at countless things and combinations of them, and spitting out an ever changing number of saying ""this dude needs to pay X for the numbers we need to make our business to function"". 

Your agent MAY be able to offer you other options, ways of adjusting your policy, or perceived risk profile, review other discounts that may apply to you again (they should be doing this every year for you regardless), etc. How good your answers are to all the things above is the likelyhood of how good your options will be. 

If you bought your policy on, ""what was the cheapest policy i could find on a web search"" the answer is, your insurance company won't do anything for you, and honestly, don't poke the bear. you get what you pay for. That just might be your normal increase and they haven't noticed the ticket yet because they suck that much.

Ultimately the only way you really can lower your risk is with time and being a safe driver. Even then, that doesn't mean insurance goes down, as the costs to insure you don't drop in turn.

The same answer applies to shopping around as well. Ultimately that hurts your rates, especially if you are doing it every year. But there are cases where shopping around does make sense. Everyone is different (in regulated, legal non-discriminatory ways when it comes to insurance).

Edit: Insurance should never be what is cheapest. Its whatever you can balance in cost and coverage that best closes your risk to a level you are comfortable with. If it isn't doing that, what you have isn't really insurance, its a piece of paper that tells the state that you did the bare minimum and at least people will get something upfront while they sue you to death.

Edit: also no harm in shopping around constantly (i don't THINK the credit pull many do impacts credit scores). Its CHANGING carriers constantly that gets you.
This is why it's sometimes beneficial to get a traffic lawyer to help you get it to a non moving violation. If a lawyer charges a flat fee of $500 or so, but can get you to a non moving violation, then even with the fee you'll pay to the court on top of the lawyer fee is often less than just one year of the premium increase from insurance.
I figured inflation played a part too. It is getting very ridiculous, it‚Äôs a shame. What other insurances did you have in mind
I believe all moving violations are points. I think insurance is wise to these general compromise violations being speeding tickets with no points but more revenue to the town

It‚Äôs all a racket on all sides. I think it‚Äôs only worth it if you are such a shit driver you are in danger of suspension."
Med Spa in NJ Scam?,"Med Spa shady booking policies

Question 

Is it fair to not allow your customers to reschedule or rebook 72 hours in advance or even cancel their appointment without getting penalized?  

There‚Äôs this one MedSpa where I made an appointment but I have changed my mind and I do not want to have this appointment in regardless they took a $200 deposit and then another $200 deposit and according to their policy, you are not allowed to cancel or reschedule without forfeiting everything that you paid, including the entire amount of the procedure so basically I am locked in in somehow getting the procedure or different procedure in which I‚Äôm paying and egregious amount of money. 

It seems really unfair and unreasonable to not allow your customers to cancel an appointment 72 hours in advance and get their deposit back instead they keep your deposit and they charge you for the entire procedure despite not even getting it. How is this legal? This business is a New Jersey 

Edit:

The more I think about it, this is straight up theft. 

I should note a reason I want to cancel is because the med spa has sanitation complaints and I realized this after the fact smh ü§¶ ",0.42,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jcxotf/med_spa_in_nj_scam/,60,1jcxotf,2025-03-16 22:33,"Did they make you aware of this policy when you gave the deposit?
What does your contract say?

I had an incident where I made an appointment for a service (prepaid) that had a strict cancellation policy and I agreed. My appointment was for 1:00 pm on a Saturday.  I showed up at 12:45 for my 1:00 pm appointment and was told that they called that morning to reschedule for 10:00 am and that I forfeited my payment by not showing up at 10:00 am.  I had no access to a phone that morning and did not get the message, and even if I had, I was working.  That's why I made a 1:00 pm appointment.

I files in small claims and got my money back. I showed up. They moved the appointment, not me. 

Look at your contract or agreement.
[deleted]
I mean for anyone taking that kind of deposit, i would have read the cancellation policy very carefully. 

Because deposit structures like that imply that either:

1. The place is incurring financial risk should you cancel your appointment, by reserving time and cost they will not recoup should you cancel, which is perfectly reasonable for some things, and considering the cost, i need to make sure i understand their policies.

Or

2. (2) The place is scammy and has shady billing practices

Edit: Not intending to imply they are the same, just the reddit editor insists on trying to make it look like that. There are plenty of reasons why a place may have valid reasons to have a limited cancellation policy, and we deal with them every single day. I would have been SURPRISED and in fact, a little concerned, if a place giving a medical procedure didn't have a strict cancellation policy.
Not a lawyer, but I assume it would depend on whether or not they informed you about this policy before you gave them the deposit.

If you agreed to the conditions and gave them the deposit after having been informed of the conditions, I don't think that that could really be considered a scam and I'm not sure you have much recourse.
Contact the NJ Department of Consumer Affairs. Let them look at it. If they see something, they‚Äôll investigate it.
It‚Äôs not an appropriate policy to have in the first place and NO. 

If a consumer books an appointment and maybe a day later changed their mind 72+ hours prior to their appointment they shouldn‚Äôt be penalized $1000
Oh I wanted to cancel 4 days before my appointment and they said they will penalize me for $1000
It was for like Botox
Yupppp
But doesn‚Äôt this violate consumer protection? Why don‚Äôt a customer able to cancel their appointment? The owner is under a sexual harassment lawsuit and there are sanitation complaints. I learned this unfortunately after the fact and I wanted to cancel my appointment but I can‚Äôt bc I‚Äôm going to be penalized for $1000
Okay I will
> Did they make you aware of this policy when you gave the deposit?

> It‚Äôs not an appropriate policy to have in the first place and NO. 

Understood.  

I'm not a lawyer, but I'm sure some lawyers would say it's not an enforceable contract, and others would say it is.  I'd probably say it is.  Airlines have been doing it forever, book a flight, realize you made a mistake 25 hours later, you are shit out of luck.  

Gotta do the old ""I'm not canceling, I'm rescheduling.""  And if you're legit concerned, the DCA in NJ is a void to scream into.
What does your contract say?

Let me guess, this is for laser hair removal, right?

Go to Downtown MedSpa in Jersey City.  They have good rates and do a good job.  They also won't screw you over.
Go to a plastic surgeon or dermatologist going forward. You get what you pay for.
It's on you to check out a place before you sign a contract and give them money. 

Anyone can accuse anyone else of anything.
Again, I am not a lawyer, but I would assume that it would not.

It doesn't really matter what kind of lawsuits the owner of a business has against them. Lawsuits are civil matters, firstly, not legal matters. Secondly, if it's a lawsuit against himself as an individual and not against his business then I think a court would say you don't have a leg to stand on regarding this matter between yourself and the business.

Regarfless, if you *had* been made plainly aware of the full policy and what you were agreeing to, and you still agreed to the guidelines of said policy as they were laid out to you (even though a reasonable person might find the guidelines you had agreed to to be unfair) then you likely have no real way to fight this. 

You would probably have to prove that you were never informed about these conditions and that anything you might have signed or paid for was signed or paid for *without* you having a reasonable understanding of what conditions you were agreeing to. If you were informed that these were the policies and you agreed to them, then those were the policies you agreed to.
It‚Äôs free. All they can say is that they can‚Äôt help you
Yup it‚Äôs like an airline
No it‚Äôs for like Botox and threads ‚Ä¶ the MedSpa gave me the contract after I booked my appointment
Oh I‚Äôve learned my lesson. Only legit places like chains.
Yeah, I know I‚Äôm just venting about how it‚Äôs not fair to allow consumer to cancel an appointment 3, 4, 5 days in advance because they change their mind it should be allowed. It should be OK without getting egregiously penalized for up to $500-$1000.
I booked the appointment then they made me sign these papers so it‚Äôs a scam.
The contract says you do a $200 deposit and if you cancel or reschedule you forfeit the deposit then they did another $200 deposit randomly
Chains aren't totally legit either. Can have just as many issues with them too. 

You want a medical doctor.
clearly you haven't.
That doesn't necessarily make it a scam, either.

Did you fully read the documents they asked you to sign before you signed them? What did they say regarding their policies around cancelations or about what you would owe them in the event of a cancelation?
Yes, chains are the places you usually have problems with.
[deleted]
Huh
It‚Äôs unfair to the consumer to not allow you to cancel an appointment four days beforehand or a week beforehand. A consumer is able to. They might have an emergency or they might change their mind. It‚Äôs absolutely not fair to do that to a consumer.
Not everyone goes because others don't like the way they look. They do it for themselves.
You aren't actually answering any of the questions I've asked you. Could you please respond to what I've said? 

I gave you my time and my respect, and I would appreciate you doing the same in kind by answering the questions I asked. Thank you.
[deleted]
OK, so when I asked about canceling my appointment about four days in advance, they said that I would lose the $400 and then I would also lose the cost of the procedure so it would be like a total of $1000 therefore I‚Äôm not able to cancel reschedule or do anything with my appointment and I would get penalized so now I‚Äôm forced to do this appointment that I don‚Äôt want to do
So someone who has severe acne that can be fixed with a good skincare routine should instead just go to therapy? Or melasma that is hard to get rid of? Or maybe it's scars from a car accident. Do you know how much therapy costs these days and how long you wind up going for? Easily $150 a pop over months and months to come to terms with something that can be fixed medically in a visit or two?

Don't you do anything for yourself? Color your hair? Shave? Get hair cuts? Shower? Eat well? Exercise? Are you saying accepting yourself extends to all of that and people should just ignore taking care of themselves and go to therapy instead?
Thank you, but that also isn't really a response to what I asked you. I have been reading your thread and already understand this information.

I'll ask again:

>Did you fully read the documents they asked you to sign before you signed them? 

>What did they (the documents) say regarding their policies around cancelations or about what you would owe them in the event of a cancelation?

A non-refundable deposit required for all appointments, deposit will be applied to the cost of your procedure as long as the original appointment is keptWe require a minimum of 72 hours notice to cancel or reschedule any procedure appointments.In the event of a cancellation without rescheduling, the  deposit will be forfeited, and any future appointments will require a new deposit.Cancellations or rescheduling with less than 72 hours notice will result in the forfeiture of your  deposit AND you will be charged the full price of the procedure you were booked for. If you book an appointment for a procedure and come in for your appointment but decide not to proceed with the procedure, you will still be charged the full price of the procedure. To be fair to all patients, this policy is strictly enforced regardless of the circumstances. ¬†
Best,



*** note they took a 400 deposit
Alright, understood. I guess my other question would be:

Was this appointment for this coming Monday or Tuesday, and is this place closed on weekends? Because if so, they likely consider 72 hours notice to be before Thursday or Friday. Like 72 hours of business.

If they charged you twice for your deposit, you should probably be able to contest the second charge with your cardholder.
They are open Saturdays and that‚Äôs when I was going to cancel
What day was the appointment originally scheduled for?
Tuesday
Canceling *on* Saturday for a Tuesday appointment isn't 72 hours of notice even if they were open on Sunday.
It‚Äôs literally 4 days in advance and they take calls all weekend. You‚Äôre really her defending a shady Botox injector
If your appointment was for this coming Tuesday and you called after they had already opened on Saturday, then that's not four days in Advance. Amd it's not 72 hours advance, either.

Saturday (called)

Sunday

Monday

Tuesday (day of appointment)

You called *on* Saturday, and you also don't count the Tuesday/appointment day itself *in* the 72 hours. You actually only gave them 48 hours notice, even if we counted Sunday.

EDIT: Also, was it the clinic itself taking your call? Or was it an answering service? An answering service passes the message on for the next business day.
The clinic took my call they take calls on weekends
It‚Äôs 72 hours in advance LOL 

Most places have automated booking where you can modify your changes regardless of open or close hours. 

Are you going to also count the hours we sleep as not in the 72 hours? 

Lol
Do you know for a fact that the person you spoke to was a receptionist in the office and not a person working for an answering service on behalf of the clinic? 

You still didn't give 72 hours advance even if they operate and take their own calls all weekend, regardless. Calling on Saturday is not giving them 72 hours advance notice to cancel an appointment scheduled on Tuesday.
I'm not the one that determines how they count it. I don't work there. But I've had to have enough specialist appointments, and have had to give 72 hours advance on calling for controlled prescriptions in my life, that I know how this generally works.

You gave them Sunday and Monday, and that's only if Sunday is an office day for them. That isn't 72 hours of notice. And you said they answer phones all weekend, but are you sure that it's actual staff at this clinic answering or is it an answering service that doesn't deliver the messages until Monday morning?

You should talk to a lawyer about this,if I'm being honest. But there's a good chance they're probably going to take your money just to tell you the same thing.
Yes LOL
You‚Äôre ridiculous. 72 hours notice is 72 hours it‚Äôs not discrete work hours that‚Äôs absurd.
Regardless of the 72 hours. Even if it‚Äôs 200 hours before you‚Äôre shit out of luck and they take $1000
What even makes you say that? They laid out the policy for you and you didn't stick to it.
Because that is their policy once you make an appointment you‚Äôre in $200 forfeited yes or no you go you don‚Äôt go. You will have to pay that $200 just to book and you don‚Äôt get it back if you cancel it or reschedule it 100 hours before 200 hours before.
Yes, that's how non-refundable deposits always work. Were you informed that the deposit was non-refundable at the time you paid the deposit?
NOPE
The document you signed didn't include anything about the deposit being non-refundable, or saying that there were conditions under which it would not be refunded to you?
I booked an appointment. I put my deposit. Then 1 day later I made to sign all this paper work and they take another $200
So wait, you actually paid them twice? Like, they didn't *charge* you twice for one deposit that you agreed to pay, but rather instead you agreed twice to give them a $200 deposit?
Paid just a $200 deposit then they took another $200
Yes I understand that.

What I'm asking you is, did you hand them your card on two separate occassions and on each occassion get charged $200? Or did you hand them your card one time with an agreement to pay $200 but they charged you the $200 twice?
Nope just 1x
Yeah, you should contact your bank/CC company and dispute it."

Do you happen to have your Google/ apple location data? If so, you can submit an appeal online with screenshots and a brief explanation and get it dropped. Or at least that's what I was able to do. I would try some legal advice subs or better yet, call an actual lawyer if that doesn't work out. Best of luck!
Check your ticket to see if it actually matches the car. My ticket did not match the color of my car and I wasn't the there.
Ran into this over a year ago started getting parking tickets and red light camera violations from NYC.    When I saw the pic of the car you could see not my car but yes my plates.  Or to be more accurate my plate numbers.     Had to go to DMV to surrender the plates and get new ones and don‚Äôt forget to make sure to check your ez pass account to make sure pay by mail isn‚Äôt  running on your account 

2 years later still fighting NYC on a few tickets that are not mine 


Common scam since NJ plates are not that hard to print out fakes
Fight it . More than likely it was an input error. You should be able to provide a copy of your registration that shows the plate, make and model and they will see that even if the plate number is the same the color , make and model will likely be different enough that they will realize the error 

Something similar happened to me years ago .  I think it said I was parked in Jersey City at 2am. I never went to that part of the state in the evening, let alone late night so I knew it was a mistake.  They had my plate number but the color and make weren‚Äôt even close . You don‚Äôt need a lawyer
This happened to me in NyC. Parking in a bus stop, over $150 ticket. My car was red and it was a blue car!! (And my car was in Never in NYC)

I submitted my registration showing the color of my car and the court said they wouldn‚Äôt accept it because I could have painted the car.

Thats when I found out, with parking tickets you are guilty until proven innocent.

I ended up paying it
I got a court notice for a delinquent parking violation in New Hope  PA. I was not there that day and I live in Union County nj. The license plate was mine but the car description was a totally different make and model. I sent a letter with a copy of my registration and explaining I was at work that day and my boss would confirm. It got dismissed. Could they have written down the wrong plate number? No lawyer needed.
This happen to me in Jersey City. I have video from my Ring of my car in my driveway. Took 15 months but fought it. They didn‚Äôt even look at the video and asked me to swear if I am telling the truth. They then dismissed the case
This happened to my husband last year. The ticket was for a vehicle we don't own. I sent proof that the license plate belonged to his truck and not the car on the ticket.
IDK if it still happens but back in the day if you pissed a JC cop off in another city or town you would get a ‚Äúphantom‚Äù ticket in JC.
Go into court and let‚Äôm know what happened‚Ä¶I also was ticketed without cause, and the judge dismissed it once I explained‚Ä¶
 I had this happen with the city I'd never been to at a time I couldn't have been there. I had to go to njm direct.com - if it's a different authority, look up their info on Google to be sure - I'm telling you to look it up just in case it's a scam because if you follow the information on the ticket itself that might be what they want you to do. I called someone and then they worked with me through email to fill out a form to get it taken care of. Somewhere else on Reddit when it happened to me, it was explained that they use an electronic system and whoever made the ticket likely just did a typo with whatever info, maybe license plate too close to yours. 

It wasn't a huge hassle just medium annoying and relatively straightforward but I got to deal with a real person which made it easier. Good luck
Find all the discrepancies on the tix; color, make, model of car.
I got one of these for Sea Girt last year. Not my car, not my plate.  I filed the appeal online and have yet to hear another word.

EDIT: for the heck of it I checked njcourts again and it now says ‚Äúresolved‚Äù and the actual ticket is gone so I guess they believed me.
I think you need to have one of those insurance company trackers installed in car to show location, your phone won't do, it's not attached to your car. Might be easier to pay $45, at least there are no points.
This has happened to my family four times. Once of the four, said I was in Philly but I was in high school and terrified of the highway. 

Recently, my dad got his with a $3k bill for his car being towed from Philly, he lives in Jersey. 


Turns out someone had the car but a fake plate (paper print out) and I had to mail in paperwork to dispute it. Finally everything got sorted but it took months. The kicker was he sold this car like 10 years ago.
Same happened to me. Plead not guilty online and said car wasn‚Äôt mine and I wasn‚Äôt in reward. Case was dismissed
That also happened to me. The officer read the license tag incorrectly. I wrote a letter to the agency stating I could prove I was at work in South Jersey during the time of the ticket.
This happened to me like 13 years ago! I ended up paying because my car registration was suspended over it. It wasn‚Äôt just Newark either, I think it was also another urban city are where I had never been, maybe JC? It was like 2-3 tickets over a period of a few months issues to a black Lexus which I have never owned or driven in my life. I was convinced someone had spoofed my license plate.
You don‚Äôt need an attorney to talk to the DA office.  Just call and see if they made a mistake.
How were you notified? Did you get a letter?
You don't need a lawyer!! Go to court state your case!!
Happened to me once, Newark as well. I had to call the town a few times and they realized it was the wrong make, model, and color. They threw the ticket out for me.
Happened to me twice, both times in Jersey City. Except it was on my work vehicle, that never leaves Mercer County. I called the number on the ticket, told them the car was not in Jersey City that Friday night at 9pm because it was parked in Trenton and I could send them the Ezpass receipts to prove had not been on the Turnpike that day. I also offered to show them the camera footage of the car parked in our lot at the time it was allegedly in JC.

This happened TWICE, exact same scenario, like a year apart. First time, I think they were able to cancel it over the phone, second time I had to write a letter.  Both times were during COVID (2020, 2021). I don‚Äôt know what type of scam they‚Äôre running up north, but fight that ticket.
Call the town and confirm. I kind of remember someone else having a similar issue. Also check if your license plates are duplicated.
Happened to me almost 25y ago

They sent me a picture of my car illegally parked....clearly wasnt my vehicle and they entered the plate number wrong, called and they said i had to come to court. (It may have been Jersey City not Newark, it was so long ago but it was one or the other)

Sat there ALL FUCKING DAY and never was called, they told me to come back the next day, i paid the ticket and left

I suggest you do the same because you either A- need to hire a lawyer to go there in your stead or B- go there yourself, and either option will cost more money than just paying the fine, either in real dollars or in wages/time lost and fuel, tolls and parking costs

Its just not worth it

Which is fucking absolutely garbage and feels torally wrong but thats life...it shouldnt be, but it is

E- apparently you can do it online now, which is fantastic, just do that!
Pay it. They‚Äôll suspend your license and it‚Äôll cost more than $45
Great to hear you can appeal online. ¬†Last time this happened to me, I spent half the day in Jersey City waiting to tell a judge that their system sent me a ticket for someone else‚Äôs car.
This is the best answer. I had to do zoom court but it was quick with screenshots of my Google location (somehow my being a million months pregnant and the ticket being issued in the middle of a snowstorm in a town about 40 minutes away wasn't enough).
Also the lawyer I called was kind enough to just give me these tips without charging.. Hopefully u can find someone like that too.
I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do but I hate the options of ‚Äúpay a fine or give the courts your location data‚Äù
Google/app location really doesn‚Äôt matter. Someone else could have been driving your car and parking tickets go to the registered owner unless you have someone else say they were the driver that parked the car at court. Unless of course you have a prosecutor that‚Äôs lenient and takes your word for it.
Echoing this as a former court employee 

If they put in the tag number wrong, it‚Äôll auto-populate your information. If they run the registration through the DMV system, they‚Äôd ideally see it doesn‚Äôt match the information for the vehicle written on the ticket and move to dismiss it. 

Some courts may give you shit and just tell you to plead not guilty and attend court, though.
Yeah I got a notice in the mail from some court saying I didnt pay the initial fine but I have no clue when I got the initial fine
How many scams do you pay
Same. I sat there all fucking day 25y ago, never got seen and was told to come back tomorrow....i paid the 150 bucks and left
""some court""?¬† If it wasn't the City of Newark it's a scam.¬†
I just checked I got the letter from City of Newark Newark Municipal Court

Motorcycle permit/license question,"I‚Äôm getting my first motorcycle in New Jersey. I picked up a motorcycle this weekend.

I guess my question is which DMV do I need to go to to get permit do I need an appointment?

How salvage titles work in NJ,"If a salvage title car that had the little S status on the title goes through the necessary repairs and inspection, then becomes a rebuilt title, will the title still have the little S on it or will it change to something else like R or something???",1.0,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jcvvbl/how_salvage_titles_work_in_nj/,2,1jcvvbl,2025-03-16 21:11,"The little s never goes away.

Ohh okay. I'm asking because I bought a car last year from NY that had a title that seemed clean but the DMV clerk told me that it was salvage title, and I can register it just find and drive it but it will just have the little S on it.

Handling Repeat Dog Poop Offenders,"How do people deal with dog owners who curb their dog in front of your home and don't clean it up? It's hilarious because they let the dog poop right under the no dog waste sign repeatedly. I've got an image of the person but haven't seen them in person on the block yet. 

Is it smart to just look out for them and confront them (sensibly) about cleaning up after their dog? Do I just report them (how)? I was also thinking of printing their incriminating photo and hanging it on the pole? Is that too much?

I can't just ignore it.

I just happened to look out my front porch window and there's a lady walking her dog. They stop right in front of my house. The dog poops. The lady starts to walk away. I yelled out the window for her to pick it up. She was startled and said she was sorry and proceeded to pick it up. Never saw her walk her don by my house again.

Like WTH? She had a poop bag with her but was just going to leave it there and walk away. Gross.

When I walk my dogs, if I see that someone didn't pick up their dog's poop, I break out a piece of sidewalk chalk and write ""Bad Human! Pick it up!"" on the street by the poop.
Just follow them one day and drop the poop on their yard.

We have a neighborhood FB group. Anyone gets called out pretty quick and enough cameras in the neighborhood, for someone to catch the person.
Lived with a guy like this. I would take the dog out occasionally if he was stuck at work. One day I was walking him and picked up his poop and a guy came out of the door yelling at me about how much this dog loves shitting on his lawn until he saw me with the bag and was so flabbergasted he just walked back inside.

Some people just don't care...
Yesterday I was in Englewood with my two dogs walking around downtown Palisades Ave.  I could not believe how many piles of poop I had to avoid.  The most shocking interaction I had was when I bent over to pick up my dog‚Äôs excrement a passerby said ‚Äúwhat are you doing nobody cares‚Äù
If you can figure out their usual walk you can follow them off and drop off the bags off on their porch. My neighbor hated that lol
Well positioned motion activated sprinklers and cameras.

Edit:  Ha!  Dogshitters downvoting?  Did you come too close to my property lately?  

 I think the sprinklers are better than when I'd pick it up and throw it at them....
Contact your county health department with any information you have. They will follow up with the owners if you know who they are
I live on a pretty busy road in terms of foot traffic and car traffic. We have a little box below our mailbox that says ‚Äòplease clean up after pets‚Äô with a roll of poop bags inside. Believe it or not‚Äî it has completely solved our problem. 

I think that sometimes people just forget to take a bag with them! I‚Äôve done this before (but I‚Äôm also the crazy person who will drive back to the spot of the poop and pick it up after my walk).
No dog poop. this means you. (picture underneath)
The best is when they leave the poop bag in the road with the poop in it. I see it all  the time. Why do that???
Had to do the same thing. Our house had been vacant for a few weeks before we moved in and one of the dog owners decided vacant house = no clean-up.

I didn't have to yell. As soon as the guy realized I was going to give him a hard time, he cleaned up and didn't come back.
This is the way
Also on the neighborhood groups
This was my solution.  Big dog, really big poops.  No consideration.  
I would scoop it up and leave it on their stoop.  Didn‚Äôt take too many times for them to get the message. 
I stopped short of putting it in a bag and lighting it on fire - but believe me - I was tempted.
Nice.
That's part of the problem. Don't know who they are or if they even live on my street. I'll give the department a call anyway this week and hear what they have to say. Thanks.

Got a ticket for open container in Hoboken at pier A (offense 68-13),"I need some advice on a situation that happened recently. I was with friends celebrating a birthday in Hoboken, NJ.

Likely when you go to court they‚Äôll give you the option of pleading guilty, talking to arrange a plea, or pleading not guilty and having a trial. Your best bet is probably the middle one. 

If the law is written that having the container is what‚Äôs illegal, then it doesn‚Äôt matter if you were drinking. The law probably doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúopen container is illegal only if you are drinking it.‚Äù

Lots of lawyers do free consultations. Try giving one or two a call just to get an idea.
I'm not a lawyer, but I'd fight it.

The law 68-13 says: 
>
The drinking of alcoholic beverages on the public streets of Hoboken and the common areas of the Hoboken Housing Authority is hereby prohibited. No person shall serve, sell, dispense, drink or consume any alcoholic beverage on a public street, highway, avenue, alley or road of the municipality, or upon any public grounds, parks, sidewalks, marine basins or in any automobile, vehicle or in any other means of transportation on said public street, highway, alley, avenue, sidewalk, park or marine basin, or the common areas of the Housing Authority, in said municipality.

In order to find you guilty, the police have to provide evidence that you did one of the illegal acts.  From what you say, you were in possession of an open container.  You did not serve, sell, dispense, drink or consume it. There is no evidence of you doing it. 
Call the court and tell them you want to plead not guilty. Ask for discovery - especially, but not limited to any body cam footage of the responding officers and any footage from other area cameras controlled by the city.  If you plan to use statements of any of the people in your group, then get their statements and be ready to provide that info in discovery if the prosecution asks. 

However, I'd be careful of other things that might come up. If anyone in the party was under 21 and they were consuming alcohol - and you were in possession of the bottle, then you might wind up in line for other charges as that evidence is uncovered in court.
This doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Ä¶you picked it up because you were going to throw it away but later you said they made you dump it out. Were you going to throw away a full bottle of champagne? I wouldn‚Äôt go with this version of the story when talking to the judge or prosecutor.
lawyer up with someone local to your jurisdiction - post this in r/hoboken and ask for recommendations. they will sort it with the prosecutor so you just pay court costs and a fine and don‚Äôt catch a charge on your record.
The citation for possession of an opened container is 145-23. They cited you for consumption. What you do with that info is up to you but how would they know if you drank it or not? DO NOT admit to having the container. You are not obligated to confess to a crime but they will try to get you to admit it. They have to prove it. It's probably just a fine and unlikely to affect your driving at all.

Get ready for your insurance to go really high, happened to a friend years ago.
Does that mean that anyone who happens to pick up trash around town and happens to pickup a half empty beer bottle can be charged with having an open container?
I would not recommend talking to a prosecutor. Anything you say to them will be used against you. Talk to a lawyer.
My guy the ticket isn‚Äôt for public consumption, it‚Äôs a ticket for an open container. This doesn‚Äôt apply. Not only that, he wasn‚Äôt at the housing projects he was at the pier. 


Did you rush in with the first thing found that mentioned ‚Äúdrinking‚Äù and ‚ÄúHoboken‚Äù?
Which insurance? He wasn‚Äôt driving.
I didn‚Äôt mention that because I thought it was obvious but you‚Äôre absolutely correct and it‚Äôs an important point to consider.
This comment and OP reference 68-13 which is consumption, open container is 145-23 per another commenter, so it looks like the ticket is for public consumption.
OP specifically said 68-13.  Did you bother to read OP's question?

It's cool that you want to pursue something better for you and your family. I've found that county vocational programs have the cheapest and easiest access to career training, electrician education and apprenticeships are accessible through a few sources. It's not a quick or simple path but it's a way to ensure stability in the long term and having a hard skill is always beneficial. The state of the economy doesn't make it easy but there are state and county programs that will help in ways not available to other fields of study.

This is not the answer you want but there used to be some weird backdoor to becoming an electrician for IT server people with a certain level of experience.     That may or not be the easiest for you but it sure would be for me
IBEW for sure. P sure they have paid training
Get a job.¬†
IBEW electrician here. Highly recommend joining the union and getting into the apprenticeship program. Seriously it was such a life changer for me, and the union is why I have a viable job with good pay, healthcare, and a retirement plan set up for when I retire in 30+ years. 

Oh, and it‚Äôs a job that can‚Äôt be replaced by AI. Everyone will always need electricians.
You have to live in their district. It‚Äôs weird.
Do you still recommend this as someone who has 0 experience? I‚Äôm in the military and my job doesn‚Äôt have much hands on stuff for electrical work but interested in this line of work but have no idea on how I would even get started when I transition out of the military in a few years if I pursue this route.
What‚Äôs the work life balance like? 9 hour shifts?
I need an electrician lol
>You have to live in their district. It‚Äôs weird.

Its not weird...its a *LOCAL* union.

The idea was to have a local skilled workforce.

In 1901, NJs 1st IBEW local was formed -  #164 based in Hudson County. At that time, not everyone had a car. Getting to work could be more difficult to accomplish than the actual work.

Times have changed...NJ used to have many IBEW local unions...the International Organization decided it would be better to have less locals. Thier goal was to have 2 - a northern and a southern local. As it stands now, there are 6.

Some locals enforce the requirement a member live within territory - some do not.
Certainly. The point of an apprenticeship is to teach you; you earn while you learn. Some people start off the apprenticeship with some electrical experience. Perhaps they worked in a non-union shop or did side work with their dad or whoever. Many come in with zero experience. 

Just show up to work every day, be willing to learn and practice your skills on the job, and go to the classes when you‚Äôre required to. That‚Äôs 80% of the work right there.

As an apprentice, you‚Äôll be paired up with a journeyman or a crew and just be honest with them. Tell them you‚Äôre a first year/new to the business and don‚Äôt know much but you want to learn. A good journeyman will make sure you learn the skills you need to be an electrician. Take the initiative and be willing to learn and try new tasks. If you don‚Äôt understand something, don‚Äôt be scared to ask for help. 

I‚Äôm a journeyman now, and whenever I get apprentices to work with and train, I always try to explain the task at hand, and why it‚Äôs being done. My job is to train you so that one day you‚Äôll be a successful electrician, and your job is to give a fuck about the job and be willing to learn and work with us.

Standard is 8 hour shifts. Though certain projects may have overtime hours due to the needs of the contractor or the project. 

It varies greatly. But standard 8 hour days are the vast majority of jobs anyway.
That sounds awesome! Thank you for your response! You sound like you would‚Äôve been a great NCO if you were in the military haha. My follow up question to you would be if I were to get out of the military and do my training in Texas where I‚Äôm currently projected to be stationed at for the next 4 years and then move back to New Jersey but got my formal education in Texas would that cause any issues? My wife and I love Texas but all of our family lives in central jersey still so we would love to come home one day.
Great answer. It‚Äôs nice to see people give a shit amor their job because they want to. Not because they have to.
Thank you! Wow I can even use my GI bill that would be awesome
Is overtime mandatory cause i had family obligations that wouldn‚Äôt let me do OT lol but if not i‚Äôll start applying tonight lol
That‚Äôs a little more nuanced, so I can‚Äôt honestly give you a correct answer for that. 

You could look up Helmets to Hard Hats. It‚Äôs a program designed to get veterans into the trades/apprenticeship programs. The IBEW is a huge supporter of H2H and I know of several people that got into the apprenticeship through H2H. 

Could you start the apprenticeship in TX and transfer to a NJ local? Maybe. It‚Äôll be kind of difficult because of the different rules and bylaws that the IBEW has, and the rules for a local unions apprenticeship program may differ. Some local unions do not allow transfers. You‚Äôll have to call the local union in TX and the one in NJ that you‚Äôre thinking of joining and explain your situation.
The IBEW locals will not touch your GI Bill.

Either way...options are available
Again, highly depends on the job and contractor. 

I‚Äôll say this though. Jobs where OT is mandatory, you will have to take it. No exceptions. But more than likely you‚Äôll find out ahead of time whether that job is OT mandatory or not, or what their hours are. 

On jobs where OT is optional, you can take it as you please. But that being said, people that don‚Äôt take up OT offers or turn down OT when it‚Äôs presented to them are usually one of the first people on the chopping block if layoffs come up. They‚Äôll whack the guys that turn down OT the most. But in my personal experience, you don‚Äôt want to be on those jobs anyway. Always taking up OT because you‚Äôre scared of your job or want to please the boss man.

Nonetheless, if you have anymore questions, feel free to PM me at any time!
That is a great place to start thank you! I still have a few years until I transition out as I have some goals left to hit in my army career but I will be saving this all and researching the helmets to hard hats now and see what that is! Any advice on stuff I can do in the meantime to help make myself more competitive or learning I can do in the mean time? My current job doesn‚Äôt have me around electrical work all to much mainly heavy tracked vehicles, explosives, and lots of admin paper work but any sort of formal online education you can think of that would be relevant that I could get the army to pay for?
Not really much I can think of. Maybe you can watch YouTube tutorials on electrical theory or how-to videos. Like how to install your own outlets or different light switches/switch circuitry. 

But IMO the best way to learn is hands on. Maybe a local community college has electrical classes, but that‚Äôs usually for full time students. Wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to look into though."

You bought a house down the street from a food manufacturer

This is like buying property in Elizabeth and complaining about the noise from EWR and the port lol¬†
If the local authorities and njdep won't or can't help, try the courts.  I'm sure there would be plenty of attorneys who specialize in environmental or similar issues that would jump on board.  If the smell is as pervasive as described, which I have no reason to doubt, it should be fairly easy through monitoring and air sampling to prove what it is and where it's coming from.
Respectfully, didn‚Äôt you choose to move next to Johanna? They were there first?
These are the makers of Ssips juice boxes right? I am not surprised to hear they pollute our air. Weird tasting ice tea.
Based on the new direction of the federal EPA, you‚Äôre smelling freedom.
I was thinking the same thing.
Nope I agree, but I knew about them before and it was NEVER this bad. But now, it's unbearable.
That kinda is a bad take. That's essentially saying you can be a bad neighbor or a polluter, as long as you are the oldest one there and outlast everyone. While people should be aware of the norms and conditions of the neighborhood they are moving into, for sure, people/businesses should also be mindful of the neighbors they have and the evolution of the culture and character of the neighborhood.

You can reasonably expect only so much research done on the neighbors anyways. Like researching annual wind patterns to see if your house is located downwind if something you don't like? The pollution emissions of any given company in the area? Edit: and like OP suggested, they may have changed their output and it might be worse than it was in the past.

Besides, the kids didn't choose to live there, they were literally born into the situation/forced into it by their parents. So even if you want to use the fact that it's a choice to absolve responsibility, it's not a choice for everyone. Some people are born into the situation, the kids may very well have lived there their whole lives.
Not even close. I am not unreasonable, but when I step outside and I get a headache and feel nausea from the amount of the stench coming from that facility, and they have already admitted to having a problem that needs to be fixed, that is not okay.
My family and I were hoping it wouldn't come to that, but at this point I think that is our only option because at the rate everyone is moving this won't be resolved for another 10 years.
They have been there for a while, but it's never been this bad. So while I agree I'll never move near any facilities again, it needs to be fixed ASAP.
You're right. They make a lot of juice and yogurt items. They used to serve them at my school. Not very good. I always see posts about mold in their food. No surprise!
Fair enough. If they aren‚Äôt holding up there end I‚Äôm on board.
Nah. 100% unreasonable¬†
I'm sorry you and your neighbors are dealing with this.  Sometimes, civil action is the only way.  Remember, this isn't necessarily about recovering monies for direct damages.  While you do have damages, I think it's more about your right to quiet enjoyment of your property and the protection of your assets.  This is why I think a good attorney would want to jump in.  Let them recover a fair fee, and let them force the offender into compliance.   Money talks, and all this food producer cares about is the bottom line...put pressure on their profits and they will make changes.  One would think the NJDEP or the local code enforcement would want to force action, but it may be the pollution type from the plant is not covered under their authority.

I truly hope it works out for you and your neighbors
So are you suggesting there should be no pollution regulations or standards? as long as they are the oldest landowner in the area?"
Needs yall opinion,"So Ive been considering the move to NYC end of this year for a very long time. For context, I‚Äôve lived in suburbs my whole life and was a dream to live in a city like NYC. But now I have a friend living in NJ so my options are NYC & living with random people vs living with him in NJ and making the commute to NYC (I work fully remote but I loved going to coffee shops in NYC when I visited a couple months ago). 

So I‚Äôve been looking at Hoboken, Jersey city, the rent is cheaper but my bigger pro is that I‚Äôll be able to live w one of my closest friends and hopefully be close to NYC. What‚Äôs yalls opinion on this? Should I do it? ",0.32,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jcoe6s/needs_yall_opinion/,19,1jcoe6s,2025-03-16 15:47,"It‚Äôs pretty common for people to work and spend their free time in NYC while still living in nj. Also Jersey city isn‚Äôt just a city in name. It‚Äôs a real city. So you‚Äôll be out of the suburbs for sure
If you have the urge to set up a life in NYC, you should totally do it. I loved living in NYC there is so much you can do there to make new friends. I have friends in NYC with good experiences finding roommates online, but that‚Äôs always hit or miss. If you want to feel secure with your friend, stay in NJ since the commute isn‚Äôt bad. But I think you should give NYC a shot for a year and figure it out from there.
Hoboken is a great little city.  It‚Äôs got a lot of young professionals that commute to the city.  Having said that I lived in the city for four years after I graduated and they were the very best years of my life.  Yes, NY is very expensive, but it‚Äôs worth it to have everything right at your fingertips.  It‚Äôs so nice deciding you want to go to a concert at 7pm, hoping on the subway and getting there by 730.  When you live right there you can just do things that you would need to plan and organize for if you live in the burbs.
My opinion is we don't say ""y'all"" in New Jersey.
Yes. They are both very nice cities, safe for the most part, and very close to NY. Rent is expensive, but not as much as NYC. Also, stop saying y'all. It's illegal here. We say ""you guys"" or ""you guys-es"" in the place of yall's. New Jersey is a safe and wonderful place to live, but you will never be accepted talking like that (s). Obviously, I'm half joking, we will, in fact, begrudgingly accept you. Good luck! It sounds like a great opportunity.
Needs a lot more context. Are you picking between Manhattan and JC/Hoboken or like a far out area of NYC? Hoboken and Jersey City are very close to the city and it‚Äôs easier to get to downtown from there than it is from a lot of other areas, but getting to Brooklyn from NJ is harder. 

You probably need to visit and figure out what things truly matter to you and what areas you want to spend a lot of time in.
Every single person I know who has moved to NYC has come to hate it and is actively looking for ways to get out
Candidly, I think you'll get a strong ""stay in NJ"" bias in this sub, just like you'd get the reverse bias if you asked it in NYC. It's going to be hard for you to find the ""right"" answer; it's really up to you.

But from a rational, dollars-and-cents standpoint, living in Jersey City or Hoboken is far, far more cost effective. Besides rent, you must factor in NYC income tax. If your job is staying the same but your tax jurisdiction is switching from Anywhere, NJ to New York City, you will be making less money, bar none.

As others have pointed out, living in Hoboken and Jersey City gives you incredibly easy access to the city, while avoiding some of the negatives. Honestly the one real downside of JC/HBKN versus NYC in my experience is if you're out real late, it's way more expensive to just take a cab/uber home versus anywhere in NYC. But unless you are regularly gonna be out to 2am, idk that this is much of a factor (even if it is, you just learn to plan around PATH schedules).

Anyways, I lived in JC for 5 years while working in the city. I loved it and occasionally miss it.
You didn't mention your age... I think that plays a role. It might not be a bad idea to try it for a few years. I used to live in the village back in the 90's - and it was okay. I just realized as I got older - I wanted serenity and land. I'm okay with the ""inconveniences."" Because my daily comfort is worth it. Also if things go south with society - the last place I'd want to be is in mob-like environment like NYC.  The pros and cons are entirely up to the individual - and where you are in life. If you're young then it's a good place to earn some strips and get a few notches in your belt.
I see, I‚Äôve been looking at pictures and JC definitely gives me city vibes forsure!
Oh most definitely. A lot of my friends who used to live in NYC moved out though back home‚Ä¶that‚Äôs my biggest worry versus living with my friend because I only know one other person who lives in Brooklyn but I‚Äôm not too close with him either so I‚Äôm worried itll be hard to find meaningful relationships there
That does sound nice! Would love to live in soho but I really enjoyed the vibe around gramercy place‚Ä¶was one of my favorite morning walks when I was visiting recently
Sorry bout that didn‚Äôt know
Oops, sorry didn‚Äôt realize people in NJ didn‚Äôt say that!
Yes pretty much. One of my requirements if I lived in JC would be to live very close to a path station. I would not want to live in JC being very far from a station because I know that‚Äôll just make me go to NYC less and thats not something I want forsure. 

Regarding Manhattan‚Ä¶ideally lower Manhattan forsure.
I‚Äôm assuming PATH schedules aren‚Äôt too slow right? Hoping that if I miss a train it wouldn‚Äôt take too long for another to come
So I just turned 25, making it a goal to live in NYC before I‚Äôm 30 and I figured this would be the best time while my job is fully remote (located east coast actually so I‚Äôm currently working EST hours from the west coast)

I think I understand your perspective as well. One of the biggest reasons why I want to move now is because I know once I‚Äôm older and I want to settle down, it‚Äôll be much harder for me to pick up my things and move especially to a place like New York‚Ä¶would rather do it now when I still don‚Äôt have those responsibilities like taking care of a family and whatnot
Personally I'd rather live with a friend over strangers, but your want to be in the city may out weigh that.
During the weekday daytimes, very regular service. Weekends can be like every 20 minutes during daytime and up to 40 minutes during nighttime. So really you just wanna be strategic, otherwise you‚Äôre gonna be waiting in the station awhile or will have to pony up for an expensive uber home."

It's one of the safest places in the state, don't worry. My partner and I are both women and we've never had any issues walking around that area at night, even when we're alone. You're more likely to have an issue with a drunk person at the Wellmont than you are running into trouble on the walk. Parking is mostly okay because there's a few garages around if you want to drive in, but the walk is perfectly safe.
It's a safe town. The entire downtown area is well-patrolled by cops, and the police station is not that far away. There are several parking decks that are walking distance to the Wellmont to choose from, all of which are safe.

School Board Budget Shenanigans,"With the State Aid numbers recently coming out for school districts, it‚Äôs time to pay close attention to what school districts are approving prior to proposing their 2025-2026 budgets. Why? Because whatever Boards of education are specifically looking to approve BEFORE their budgets are presented will indicate what piece of pie is already being reserved, and what cuts will eventually have to be made.¬†

For example, Middlesex County M@g@ stronghold Monroe Township is again betraying their constituents and taxpayers when it comes to the budget of the Board of Education. Along with controversial Superintendent Chari Chanley, the Board has publicly posted their agenda for March 17, 2025.¬†

On this agenda¬† BEFORE the budget has been finalized, this Board is planning to approve over seven million dollars in administrative and central office salaries, ultimately binding the district before the actual numbers have been reviewed?¬†¬†

¬†It is SUSPECT for such positions and substantial contracts to be approved so early, separate, apart, and in priority over the rest of the faculty and staff of the Monroe Township School District, contracts which probably will not be approved until the May 2025 meeting, well after the budget numbers come out.¬† And it certainly does not promise transparency nor fiscal responsibility.

There are other school districts that are not doing this. East Brunswick and South Brunswick have not approved admin contracts for next year yet. Robbinsville had a budget presentation on March 5- no approval of admin salaries. East Windsor had a meeting on March 10, with their budget presentation on March 13- there was no approval of admin contracts on March 10.

But for Monroe, plus differentials, the total admin salary that will be voted on Monday is $4,314,275.60, and the total central office staff salary is $2,925,881.38. What is the community even getting that is worth this, if the Board thinks it‚Äôs essential to rush these approvals?¬† Since the beginning of the year: no Civics classes, rampant cheating and drug use at the high school, and frankly inappropriate and insufficient responses to parents from the current administration.¬†

In fact, the one thing this agenda promises in the wake of these hasty approvals and anticipated budget cuts is the expendability of teachers and staff, and that the Board will not move an inch in modifying their extraordinarily top-heavy structure, where admin positions are excessive and expensive, and most importantly, LOCKED in. And it‚Äôs only March.¬†

Here are the numbers of what is being approved for admin: Tenured admin: $2,327,761.97 ¬† Non: $1,986,513.63. Again, this is public information, posted by the district themselves.

So before the Board begins awarding these contracts, why not ask them why they won‚Äôt approve all the contracts at the same time so the board has the ability to evaluate ALL the salaries, evaluate administration and staff on their performance, TOGETHER?

Be on the lookout for sneaky tactics like this from your district, because it is a strong indicator of the quality of your programming and what the Board is willing to cut and willing not to cut, in the coming year.¬†

Referendums are popping up all over with the demand to exceed the 2% cap.
I have to look but Im pretty sure all tentative budgets are to be submitted to the state by March as a requirement but doesn't mean they are approved. Although it is more of a formality that the state will approve them. 

There is a state requirement and calculation on admin costs/per pupil tharlt a district must stay underti be compliant although its not a great metric because if enrollment goes up or down substantially it throws the calculation out of whack. 

If you really want to do something you can show up to public meetings with other people and make noise, or even more run for your board in your town.

Whatever a supervisor is‚Ä¶.this district has EIGHT of them
now more than ever it‚Äôs a hollow and insulting request if they won‚Äôt even budge trimming the fat on these exorbitant positions
People should absolutely publicly question their school boards. But I feel many of them don‚Äôt even know that this is something boards try to get away with. I know for a fact that districts do not RUSH their admin contracts like this, separate and apart from the faculty and staff. Doing so before they even hold a hearing on their budget to the public is disingenuous. 

this move to approve hefty admin contracts before budget presentation also then leaves staff vulnerable to substantial cuts in the area to 40-50 positions, when they simply could have better admin staffing choices.
I am guessing: English, Math, Science, Social Studies, Foreign Languages, Arts, Special Education, Gym, ?????
Every district in the state has their salaries for next year figured out by the end of February. Assuming no major changes needed to be made, the admins are probably the easiest to figure out because they‚Äôre just being increased by a %. My district has had this information for weeks now. I‚Äôm not sure why you are assuming it‚Äôs suspicious?
Looking at what i know, at least two of these director positions were formerly supervisory (athletics, guidance), and one director position (Morolda-director of Innovative and Community Programming, Equity, and Careers Technology) did not even exist until two years ago. And the supervisor of Fine & Performing Arts, Health & Physical Education, Snyder, ! Was a middle school music teacher. The guidance director position was also previously a supervisor position, but made a director position this year. Directors make even more $$.
So I looked at my kids school district, and there are now two assistant superintendent positions that last time I looked were director positions. They are the administrator and director of all academics. I have to wonder if everyone in lock step changed the titles of these kinds of jobs. Both of them have been in their positions since my kids were in kindergarten and my oldest is now a senior.¬†"
"Goldbergs in Millburn, massive dip in quality or is it just me?","My wife and I go to Goldbergs every now and then for a quick breakfast, but it seems like over the past few years the quality has dropped significantly and the prices have increased steadily. 

A bacon egg and cheese, even before the egg shortage, was around $9 or $11, and it‚Äôs not even a good bacon egg and cheese. I could‚Äôve sworn that as a kid it was pretty solid, comparable (but not necessarily as good) as Hot Bagels Abroad in SO. Fluffy yellow eggs, decent amount of cheese, nicely cooked bacon, lightly toasted bagel. Today I ordered one for my wife and not only was it $12, but the bagel was over toasted, the eggs were overcooked and sparse, and only half the sandwich actually had cheese on it. 

Was Goldbergs always this bad at breakfast sandwiches? Is my memory deceiving me? The bagels themselves are still pretty good, and the price for a dozen isn‚Äôt horrible, but even these seem to have lost some of their quality, and the breakfast sandwiches have gotten out of control.

I can get a bacon egg and cheese on a roll from Millburn Deli across the street and it‚Äôs still expensive ($8-9 post egg shortage) but they load that bitch up and it‚Äôs very high quality. Really solid sandwich. 

I‚Äôm finding it hard to justify going back but maybe I was wrong the whole time and it was never good. Please let me know what you think!

Edit: and if people have good recommendations for bagel spots in this general area I‚Äôm all ears!

Oscars, right in town. I just had a taylor ham, egg, and cheese on a roll from them the other day and it was phenomenal. 

Bagel spot in union has really good bagels and sandwiches also (have to ask for two eggs though). The place that opened up near St Rose  has good bagels also(blanking on the name), haven't tried a breakfast sandwich though. 

I Honestly haven't been to Goldbergs in a long time, bagels 4 you I find the bagels are a bit dense. Growing up I'd go there all the time (before it was Goldbergs)
maybe all the regular employees quit bc millburn decided the poors shouldn‚Äôt live there
Some businesses continue to innovate and flourish through the years where others just go stagnant. Sounds like management is fine floating by for the years to come. Unfortunate, but can highly recommend some great breakfast spots, there's always a new one popping up! 

Vinny G's Bagels and Deli out in Florence is phenomenal! The owner is a gem of a human being, the food speaks for itself, and it's just a great area to grab a sandwich and walk down to the river for a quiet morning. I'd say any drive less than 2 hours is worth headed down for. No shortage of trails around too for a hiking day.
Is this the same Goldbergs franchise as in Westwood/Park Ridge? Because those are still the best in the area in my opinion.
Try Springfield Bagel or Supreme in Springfield just 5 min away
My experience with Goldbergs is they always charge me a different price every time I go. This inconsistency lost me as a customer.
goldbergs got bought and is quite bad now. they‚Äôre probably dealing with a bunch if road blocks from the changeover. 

5 Minutes from Goldbergs would be Bagel Pantry, Goldbergs, Halo Roasters (Not Bagel), and Oscars.
I like Millburn Deli, I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so pricey for what are pretty much perfectly normal sized sandwiches. 

It is increasingly difficult to find a really good deli sandwich around here for less than like $12 and that makes me sad
you talking about hot bagels abroad in south orange? never had a good sandwich there, definitely not incredible lmao.

Another vote for Kosher Bagels Supreme in Springfield. I‚Äôve never bought an egg breakfast sandwich but I usually get bagels and a serving of cream cheese. I did a bit of research on bagel and burger places when I was pregnant and have not been disappointed once I found that bagel spot.
Millburn deli always had a weird smell. Used to go there a lot at one point but the smell would get me
A little out of the way but New Providence has a great sub shop called Avenue Deli! They have ‚Äòhalf subs which is a full sub and full sandwiches which are just two big ass subs. GREAT prices last time I was there too. Think like $14 for the full. 

Really good subs too.
It's pricey but you'd be amazed at what sandwiches cost outside NJ. I moved to Portland some years ago and Milburn deli is a better value than almost every sandwich shop here.
I love Millburn Deli but their prices are very outrageous. $15 seems like the norm now for a solid sandwich. I miss the days of delis being the affordable option.
Maybe my memory of that spot is also incorrect, but that was me and all my friends preferred breakfast spot back in the mid 2000s. I remember having it again about 10 years ago when I did some work in SO and it was still good!
Nice, I know exactly where that place is. I‚Äôll have to check them out. Thanks for the tip
it might have been good at some point, i believe you. i lived in SOMA for the past 5 years and have never been impressed with it recently. the 3.5 stars on google would probably agree with me lol
Fair. I grew up in SOMA and my parents still live there. I've been eating sandwiches from the spot since they opened. I'm certainly biased.

I would suggest doing it in your home in late October, maybe a 90's adult sleepover theme, with a live band, and fun food, maybe a potluck.

Edit: also a donkey
Don‚Äôt have a live band inside your house. It will be way too loud.

Also is it 90s theme or adult sleepover (kind of weird theme but do you).

If it were me I‚Äôd find a restaurant/venue nearby and do it there, place that can accommodate a live band is a plus.

Otherwise I‚Äôm not sure what your question is because it seems like you know what you want?
At 30 I went to bed at 8:30pm. Start getting used to it.
You‚Äôre going to have a live band inside?
Definitely do a theme party

In my personal experience a donkey always makes the party. No donkey, no party.
>¬†food, game

Not sure what kind of recommendations you expect to get, food or gaming preferences are VERY subjective and no one here can predict what type of food/games you and your friends might enjoy. Just ask the actual people who will be going to your party what they want to do, like if they just wanna play tabletop D&D or go play paintball/lasertag somewhere or do parachute/bungee jumping or maybe do the whole party in some VRChat world where you can invite even more participants that cannot physically visit you and where you can do everything from mini-games to dancing without disturbing neighbors with loud music (if everyone is wearing VR headsets)... or if they want to watch a donkey show (sorry, but your type of question kinda deserves all of the ""donkey"" answers)."
NJ Property Tax Relief Programs,"Just wanted to let people know that NJ has started to sending out the [Property Tax Relief forms](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/relief.shtml).   Deadline to file is Oct 31, 2025.

# Senior/Social Security Disability Recipient (Homeowners, Renters, and Mobile Home Owners)

**New in 2025 ‚Äî Single Combined Application:**¬†We have made it easier for seniors and those receiving Social Security Disability in New Jersey to apply for Property Tax Relief with a new, simplified process. Our goal is to make the filing experience more straightforward and efficient. We have a single combined application for the¬†[Senior Freeze](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/ptr/index.shtml)¬†(Property Tax Reimbursement),¬†[ANCHOR](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/anchor/index.shtml), and¬†[Stay NJ](https://www.nj.gov/treasury/taxation/staynj/index.shtml)¬†programs for residents 65 and over, or those collecting Social Security Disability Benefits. We will determine your eligibility for you and send a letter with the specific benefits you qualify for.

Online filing and printable applications are¬†**now available**.

**Your Blue Book has a New Look:**¬†Mailed application booklets (Form PAS-1) will begin shipping in mid-March ‚Äî please allow until April 15th for delivery. If you have already filed, there is no need to submit another application. We¬†**will not**¬†automatically file the PAS-1 for taxpayers 65 or older, or those receiving Social Security Disability. **You¬†must¬†file the PAS-1 application on your own ‚Äî online or by paper. This includes senior taxpayers who may only qualify for the ANCHOR program.**

**FYI:   Forms for non-seniors will be sent out in the summer.**

***Senior Freeze (PTR) benefits will start being issued in July 2025, ANCHOR benefits will start being issued in October 2025 and STAY NJ benefits will start being issued in 2026***",0.86,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jcl090/nj_property_tax_relief_programs/,17,1jcl090,2025-03-16 13:05,"Have you or anyone you know received the PAS-1 form in postal mail yet?  I also read that NJ had started mailing them out but yet to find anyone I know they mailed the form to.
My mom doesn't want to apply, she finds there to be little relief and simply postpones payments - resulting in more headache and no savings.

I know she would be eligible for something,  retired on disability and so her husband is also retired. Do these programs really save money or just freeze payments every other year?
Hey, thanks for the heads up and info!  I have been wondering about this, and have it as a note/question on my white board to keep a tab on.  Was not sure what the procedure was going to be this year.
In the case of a married couple that owns a home together, do both need to be seniors/disabled to qualify, or does only one need to meet the requirements.  I have been Googling but can not find an answer.
I'm helping my mom fill out hers, since my dad passed away, the new form has it as ""estate of..."" does anyone know what the SSN should be entered as right next to it (the one that is located at the top). I presume it would be the surviving spouse, but there's no information on this, damnit, I think I may need to go back to the office of taxation AGAIN. D:
Yes, and completed on-line this morning.  My 90 year old mom also got hers.
We received one last week for the previous elderly owner of our house.
Hell yes - no headache - 20 mins on line to complete form and my 90 year mom complete forms by hand.

Now with a combine system it is even easier.

Last year, Anchor program gave us a $1500 rebate and now with the combined program, I will get more this year ;)
YES.

If they meet the age/income/residence eligibility, the Senior Freeze freezes their property taxes at whatever they were at age 65.  They will get refunded whatever the annual property tax increase is each year.  In the past 15 years, I have seen my property tax bill steadily climb.  In 2025, I will be paying $4,000 more than in 2010.  If I had turned 65 in 2010, I would still be paying 2010 property taxes.  And if your folks meet the income/residence eligibility, they could get the Anchor benefit alongside the Senior Freeze.

Even if they are not seniors, if they meet the income/residence eligibility, they would get a nice rebate with just Anchor. I don't know about you, but $1,500 is a nice chunk of change, that if offered, I cannot afford to leave that money on the table merely because I don't want to fill out an application.  You can buy dozens of eggs with that kind of money.  Or pay a PSEG bill for February.  Or you can ride the PATH train 500 times.  Or you can go through the Holland Tunnel 93 times (at peak hours; 106 times at non peak hours).  Or you could buy 50, 3-pound bags of Taylor Pork Ham Roll.
Why wouldn't you apply. She should  have been for years. Easy and all on line. It's not  just a freeze but even if it was it's worth it. 
Read the info. It's worth thousands.
I believe you still have to pay your taxes but then you will receive a rebate once a year for senior freeze. Yes it's a big savings. My mother would get a check each year for about $6000.
I believe it is based on how you file your taxes.
You had to use ID-ME for online right while the mailed in form does not require it?
My Mom had been happy with Senior Freeze for years saving her more and more on her Property Taxes. One year her Income was 2x what it normally was due to an annuity maturing and all the interest earned was finally taxed. Of course this put her over the income limit for Senior Freeze and she lost saving around $2.5K/yr on property taxes. When senior freeze first started the income limits were not very high compared to now where they are $150K. The next year she then had to start at ZERO for her Senior Freeze and now is saving around $2K/yr. If not for going over the Senior Freeze limit she would be saving over $4.5K/yr for her taxes.

Political Perspectives,"In my view, most of the political discussion in this subreddit is steeped in hatred. It seems that people think it is virtuous to espouse hatred towards political opponents. However, I believe this behavior is guided by ignorance of three basic ideas: 

1.) Hatred is not a virtue.

2.) It is less likely that the other side is stupid, and more likely that the idea you have of them is a caricature. 

3.) Narratives are opinions based on subsets of facts. You can frame anything as both good or bad by choosing different facts to paint your desired narrative. 

Both sides‚Äô narratives can be applied truthfully and yet neither side‚Äôs narrative is completely true. Both sides are spinning different facts to paint partisan narratives. In politics, people use extreme narratives to move the negotiation closer in their direction. But you should remember that that‚Äôs politics and not reality. The narratives are intentionally extreme and targeted. Whether you agree with them or not, don‚Äôt let the game of political narratives make you waste your wellbeing on hatred. 

Better yet, find a way to see the other side‚Äôs perspective, it will give you a greater overall perspective of the game and free you from political hatred. Obama and Trump both know this, and that‚Äôs why we saw them sitting together, laughing and chatting it up a couple months back. They know how to separate what‚Äôs real from what‚Äôs politics. ",0.27,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jcisz3/political_perspectives/,25,1jcisz3,2025-03-16 10:45,"I was at the Tesla protest yesterday, and while most of the cars passing by on 22 honked at us in approval, one jackass in a big black pickup truck took the time to circle the block 4 times just to pass us and throw trash, let his exhaust go off in protesters‚Äô faces and scream out the window. 4 times. Another woman literally stopped her car on 22 and sat idling, holding down her horn and scream at us as she held up traffic. Note that none of these MAGAts was driving a Tesla.

As far as I‚Äôm concerned, if you voted for Trump, you are no different than the Germans who voted in Hitler in 1933.
Yea‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna stop reading your post and go out on a limb here and say that you very clearly voted for Trump and now you‚Äôre whining about it because you just don‚Äôt understand why nobody likes you‚Ä¶.

we all hate that you voted for such a dumbass person who is literally ruining our country.

This also literally makes you a fucking dumbass. 

Hope that helps!
When one side doesn't believe in basic facts and distrusts common science, it's pretty easy to start resenting them.
Politicians who do hateful things deserve hate and total resistance.  Your false equivalence is an attempt to trivialize the hateful actions coming from Washington.
We see this only from MAGAts.  You‚Äôre not fooling anyone.
Of course there‚Äôs hatred towards people who align with Nazi and fascist ideologies‚Ä¶
Trickle-down economics.

That's all I have to say.
I agree that hatred isn‚Äôt a virtue, but you should tell that to some Republicans who absolutely let hatred guide their political agenda. Some of the attacks we have seen on trans and queer people, immigrants, etc. have definitely been born out of hatred.
*2.) It is less likely that the other side is stupid, and more likely that the idea you have of them is a caricature.*

This is where you lost me.
Right away, when you use the word ""narrative"", I can tell you're a dumb fuck that voted for Trump.

Maybe you don't like the discourse because you're a dumb fuck that voted for a 34 time felon and Russian asset, and you get mad because your brain hurts itself trying to logically understand the politics you believe in.
Counterpoint: shut the fuck up.
Trump signed an executive order on Friday eliminating support for libraries.

If you can tell me why libraries are a problem, we can have a discussion. But you can't. You say others are full of hate, but the only way to support what Trump is doing is to be so full of hate and fear of people you do not know that you're willing to die to spite them.
I believe in judging my neighbors by how they raise their family and how their lawn looks. And if those things are guided by their political beliefs, then it‚Äôs difficult to find common ground.

Ok, Schumer.

Calling them Nazi and actually thinking and believing that they really are Nazis is insanity, likely born of dense exposure to a left wing propaganda echo chamber.
This is the kind of mindset that prevents people from having civilized dialogue and actually understanding one another.
The worse their lawn looks, the more you appreciate that they're helping the bees, right?
How is it possible to have a civil dialogue with people who think the 2020 election was rigged, January 6 was a protest, the pandemic was planned, Fauci belongs in jail and that millions of people were killed by a vaccine that changes your DNA?

Trans people: ‚ÄúLeave me alone, I just want to live my life.‚Äù

MAGA: ‚ÄúFuck you and everyone like you.  We‚Äôre going to ban you from getting accurate passports, kick you out of the military while canceling your benefits you fought for, put you in prisons where you‚Äôre more likely to face extreme violence, make your healthcare inaccessible, and stop you from playing sports with your friends.‚Äù

Debating basic human rights and who should have them is not civilized discourse.
I don't give a shit about having a dialogue with Nazis
Why would I want to understand fascists?
That‚Äôs pretty bold of you to assume for someone who didn‚Äôt even claim any of that in their post, much less say they were even a Republican.

My point isn‚Äôt that you are necessarily wrong it‚Äôs just that instead of listening to understand, we (as humans) tend to just immediately shut off our brain and jump to conclusions the second we hear a red flag or disagree.

You just don‚Äôt win arguments and change people‚Äôs minds by telling them they‚Äôre stupid and that they‚Äôre wrong, what you really end up doing is making them double down on their belief even if they‚Äôre wrong. Need some grace and tact when dealing with anyone.
Firstly, you didn't answer my question. No republican ever does. Secondly, It doesn't matter if op is republican or not. My question still stands. It's been 10 years of dealing with this and I have no hope of trying to reason with people who are willfully ignorant. There's a reason that they ""double down"" on their beliefs and it has nothing to do with me, my arguments, and how stupid I think they are."

Oceans Casino has really nice showers.  I think they're in any room type.  Room rates (excluding weekends) are probably dirt cheap this time of year.  If you're really looking to splurge they have a spa too.
Depends where you are in Jersey, if you find a nice spa usually they have just a day pass and you can use the nice showers, some even offer pregnancy massages and then you can use the nice showers before or after or both! Treat yourself momma, you‚Äôve earned it! 

In northern NJ vernon has elements spa that is nice, their sister spa in Hamburg is Reflections, is even more upscale. They also have an indoor pool called the biodome. You can even get like a spa and room package if you want to stay over.
Day Spa option in Manalapan - Avanti Day Resort.  Try a prenatal massage & enjoy the rain showers for as long as you like.
As another option see if there's a quality gym where  you can get a day pass.
Instead of a hotel, I would go to a day spa! That way you can do other relaxing things. My favorite is sojo spa, I went when I was pregnant. And all outdoor pools are warmed up, not to the point where it‚Äôs dangerous. And they have other things to do as well. And their showers are great too haha.
Crystal Springs in Hamburg.
Check into Island Spa, or any Korean spa. Hot water and baths as far as the eye can see.
Most water heaters have a dial that allows you to increase or decrease the water temperature. If yours isn't on the highest setting, crank it up - you'll use less hot water and more cold because the hot needs more cold to keep it at a comfortable temperature. Therefore, your shower can last longer.
Look for a newly built (or recently renovated rooms) hotels. You might consider an ada accessible room for barrier free entry and possibly a shower bench. Even something like a new Hampton Inn or Loft catering to business travelers around North Brunswick or Princeton area might do. 

Would not recommend spas since water/steam temp run high and not good for pregnant folks at your stage.  You can go in and out of the spa but that‚Äôs going to be too much work for you and you won‚Äôt know when enough is enough.
Extended stay hotels tend to have very nice and spacious showers. I'm not sure if there are any local but Four Seasons hotels are always my favorite when I travel. I still think about the showers in the hotel in Boston.
Anyone been to the Wave Resort in Long Branch?

This shower looks nice! Plus they have a spa. (I have not personally been.) I wonder what the water pressure is like.

Also, there seems to be some nice hotels/spas in Asbury Park.
I don't have an answer, but it sounds like you need a new water heater.

Go ham and go to a fancy spa down there too. Been ages since I‚Äôve gone to ac, but it‚Äôs so worth it¬†
If you don‚Äôt mind going to AC Harrahs has a really nice big shower with a seat built in. They also have a spa and some nice restaurants you can make it a baby moon.
Logan Inn in New Hopa, PA.
Turn up the temperature on your water heater so you'll use less hot water to achieve the shower temp you desire. Most people have it at a low setting to prevent you from being scalded. Be sure to turn it back down to protect the little ones. Install a water saving shower head (all the new ones are lower flow).
Spa Toccare at Borgata has a fantastic treatment of a citrus body scrub, shower, followed by a ‚Äúfloat‚Äù session.  After the full body scrub the service provider leaves and you go into this in-room shower that has about 7 body sprays with water pressure just enough that you feel like it‚Äôs a mini massage.   Once you‚Äôre done in the shower, you lay down in a ‚Äúwaterbed‚Äù bath (you‚Äôre not submerged, it‚Äôs literally like a waterbed), and you get a scalp massage while you float.   Pampered doesn‚Äôt begin to describe it 

I can‚Äôt see them caring if you skip the float and just shower for 30 minutes
Borgata is really nice if you don‚Äôt want to go to AC though. I recently stayed at the Embassy Suites in Warren NJ and they were super nice rooms and showers. We had a larger room since it was our wedding but still the showers were really nice
At one point it was probably the best shower one could have but since the last few years they have greatly reduced the force and it's no longer like the old days. I used to bring back the mini bottles of shampoo & conditioner too because they were legit but that's gone for a long time as well.

It looks to me like it‚Äôs starting a ‚Äúgentrification‚Äù stage. Some new apartments coming up, some infrastructure work to mitigate the floods. As others have mentioned, the train station is convenient. It‚Äôs a nice little town.
It‚Äôs safe. Just keep your car locked. We get the occasional run of unlocked cars getting burglarized.
Definitely safe as others have said. I used to visit there all times of day/night for a few years and never had any issues and never felt unsafe. Also fun fact, the pivotal car crash scene from the movie Whiplash takes place in Dunellen (although wasn't filmed there).
They‚Äôre trying to build it up but reminds me of Rahway. Definitely not unsafe and with it being by a train stop, it can be worth it. You‚Äôll need a car too
I‚Äôve always heard not to mess with girls from Dunellen. Not sure why, never asked but it was a rule
The Bad:  
  
Dunellen is a flood zone. You can lose your car to flash rain/floods. And it will affect some houses.  There's a reason why the train tracks are elevated so high.
Dunellen. Strong Cops. Not ‚Äúghetto‚Äù
Very good Peruvian food.
30 Burgers too.  And Rome Pizza (cash only!)
Also, good competing coffee shop next to it. Jackie's Sweets.  I feel they have the superior espresso.

These 2 are 300 feet apart from each other. So, you are free to make you're own opinion.  
  
Between them, great pizza spot, cash only. 

And of course, a classic arcade! 8 on the Break!
It is a historic institution. At this point, are there any older businesses on Main Street?
It's the North/Central Jersey stigma on dating. It's different.  
  
NJ folks are a bit smarter than the rest, but also a bit more dramatic and untrusting. But if you know how NJ works, you're fine.

Some dude from Kentucky is not gonna have a chance. Unless he's ridiculously attractive.
I think only a few parts are in a flood zone.  Along the Green brook.  Am I wrong?

Also there are many nice homes but yes it is an old town which is only one square mile.  Some new apartments along the main street, Rt 28 or North Ave.
Yeah that place is good too, I favor Dalucas for their lattes though. 10/10 mocha everytime i go there.
The first Quick Check is on this street. Sadly, it's in horrible disrepair. 

It stinks. /serious
Yeah, just forget about it Hillbilly Bob!  Oh wait is that your IROC?
Green Brook, Bound Brook, South Plainfield.  
  
You are right. Only parts where the rivers concentrate.
Ah. I'm a coffee black, no sugar, no cream guy.  Diabetes.

So I can only appreciate how baked the beans are.
Really!? I never heard that. Very cool. The history part, not the stink part.

Tesla Protest - Route 22,"
Just wanted to share my experience at today‚Äôs ‚ÄúTesla Takedown‚Äù protest in front of the Tesla showroom/gallery/dealership on Route 22 in Springfield.


I had some of the same thoughts/questions that I saw in posts & comments on Reddit and elsewhere over the past few days: with Route 22 being such an insanely busy highway, where will we stand, will the cops harass us, etc  - but they turned out to be unfounded.  


Everybody stood on the grass near the curb in front of the Tesla building and extending about 50-60 yards down the road in both directions, which I‚Äôm pretty sure is a legal place to protest (it‚Äôs likely considered a right-of-way or ‚Äúpublic square‚Äù, especially since there‚Äôs a NJ Transit bus stop there; if there was a sidewalk it would unquestionably be legal, so while I‚Äôm not 100% sure of the laws regarding public vs private property if there‚Äôs no sidewalk I‚Äôm fairly confident that the same rules apply).  Nobody was blocking the entrances or exits, standing on or blocking the highway,  interfering with the operation of the business or yelling at/harassing customers or employees, so I don‚Äôt think there was much the cops or the company could do about it.  


Cops were there, but they hung out with the Tesla employees near the front of the building and stayed away from the crowd the whole time, with two exceptions: they pulled someone off to the side to discuss a private matter (we recorded just in case), and they had to tell some idiot to keep driving who *stopped her car in the middle of the highway* to yell out her window and argue with us about whether or not Musk is a Nazi, lol.  


Lots of enthusiasm!  The turnout was EXCELLENT - easily 200 to 300 people, maybe more like 400+ at peak but I didn‚Äôt walk the line and count so I could be off by a bit.  No negativity, no violence, no trouble or disturbances.  I was really happy to see more than a few people brought American Flags, too, since I‚Äôve long been of the opinion that we need to ‚Äútake the flag back‚Äù from those who have co-opted it.  


Feedback from the people driving by was overwhelmingly positive; drivers were constantly honking horns, raising fists, giving thumbs up, yelling ‚ÄúFuck Musk‚Äù/‚ÄúFuck Trump‚Äù/etc.  Very few negative reactions from motorists - there were *maybe* 20 or 25 people that gave the finger or yelled something shitty over the entire course of the afternoon.  One woman hurled insults while her toddler in the back seat flipped the bird, which was unsurprising but pretty funny given the cross and praying hands stickers on her rear window.


Just a very positive afternoon overall.  It was so great to see Americans of all stripes & political affiliations stand together in solidarity against the unpatriotic & un-American bullshit this Administration is trying to shove down our throats.  It wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúangry liberals‚Äù in attendance: I spoke with one person who said they were a lifelong Republican voter who just couldn‚Äôt stomach the things that are being done right now.  


Such an inspiring and uplifting experience.  Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!

Drove past this in my dad‚Äôs Tesla (I know I know) and felt very silly and self conscious when I honked to show support and realized what car I was driving  üò≠ Great turnout
Even cops where supporting the protest, even an UNDERCOVER cop
I saw you guys! I was having a terrible morning & was in a truly foul mood but had to go to the Staples next door to the Tesla dealership. Seeing you all there was a total surprise and absolutely made my day. Turned my whole attitude around. No one was blocking any exits & entrances and you were all super respectful. I honked in support as I left! üíô‚úäüèª
Musk borrowed heavily to finance his purchase of Twitter, using Tesla stock as collateral. If the price of Tesla stock continues to fall‚Äîit is down 46 percent in the last 90 days, it was at $479.86 and now is at $249.98‚Äìit becomes increasingly likely for banks to call him on his loans which may force him to liquidate his Tesla holdings and allow someone else to force him out OR it could just bankrupt him. Not sure which‚Äîtoo many variables here, and some people use owning Tesla stock as a proxy for investing in SpaceX‚Ä¶and we see how that‚Äôs going‚Äîbut these protests could be considered a harbinger of the death of Tesla and the financial ruin of one of the most odious people on the planet.  
  
So good news!
I‚Äôm in Hollywood Beach FL for spring break and we went to the Aventura mall today and there is a Tesla showroom there and it was incredibly disappointing to see how many people were in there looking like they were having a good time checking out the cars. Not a protester in sight.
Yeah I saw that lady get yelled at the cops üòÇ
Was out on the highway today driving for a few hours - the amount of Tesla‚Äôs with i bought this before he went crazy or a crossed out Elon bumper sticker was very noticeable and very funny!
Thank you for the great work today! Ty for telling us all about it. So cool!
Bruh I just picked up my car from their recently those employees already deal with enough crap what's the point of doing this
Can they do one in Paramus Tesla!
I flipped off a Cybertruck in South Brunswick today.

I‚Äôm doing my part!
I totally support the protest however there were bad actors out there today. Unfortunately, I drive a Tesla (bought years ago) and while I was stopped to merge on 22 across from the protest, a person approached my car screaming and acting in a threatening manner. It scared my 5 year old to point he started to cry. That was completely unnecessary.
Springfield (and others) made it to Chris Norlund's video! [youtu.be/9l6FL0IT\_hE?si=iG7cagvQ91Uupnk4&t=263](http://youtu.be/9l6FL0IT_hE?si=iG7cagvQ91Uupnk4&t=263)
Where did you end up parking? Is there street parking on the side street that was available?
I so much agree with taking the flag back. I wish there was something I can do that supports this. Obviously, if I just put a flag up, all the people wearing maga hats smile and wave. Share if you know of anything in progress.
Glad you guys had a good turnout! I do the one on RT 17 in Paramus on Wednesdays. Less people (it is a weekday 4-6) but positive all around. Side of the highway, some üñï but more support ‚úä We had a few people drive speed by real close to us but otherwise a safe and positive experience. The showroom guys offered us water. I saw a cop pull in but we didn't interact at all. We don't boo or call out Teslas driving by (it's Bergen county and THERE'S SO MANY) and I flash ‚úåÔ∏èand a big ol smile to hecklers

Glad to see grass roots resistance. I drive past the Lamington Rd/Rte 206 intersection where there have been a gaggle of Maggots with signs promoting Trump for a third term. FYI Lamington Rd is where Trump's golf course is. It would be interesting to see a gathering of protesters at that intersection.
I was there too and this summary is 100% correct. Looking forward to the next one!

Despite all the protesting against Tesla, still no official statements by Musk or Tesla. Shows how crappy of a car company they are. Do they really care about their customers?!?!?
Will there be one at Eatontown?
Were there many customers?
The logic of these types of protests are unintelligent. There are other ways to be heard. You are just hurting hard working people and people in general.
How was it organised?
Jesus.  People are stupid.
Driving up and down 287 today and it seemed like every car around me was a Tesla. They having a fire sale or something?
Dude! Well, done, my friend.
So I see the need to protest and agree with you about taking back the flag, but is there a specific goal for these protests or is it just about getting voices heard? For example, I would totally support a coordinated campaign to get the other shareholders to vote Elon out as CEO by showing that he is harming the business.
Hell yeah man!
Keep up the great work. Thanks for the update!!!
protesting against $2T deficits i hope
Where did you park?
That's good, but I will say it was a bit depressing seeing 3 cyber trucks today in minority majority towns. One in Union City, and another one or two (maybe it was the same one) in Paterson, Little Palestine.
Musk owns 13 percent of Tesla¬†
. The other 87 percent is owned by individuals and various funds.
¬†I understand people wanting to hurt Musk financially but how many other people are being hurt by this.¬†
If Tesla were to collapse, Musk will still be a billionaire but alot of people will loose their retirement savings and Tesla workers will loose their jobs.¬†
¬†Think about what outcome you are looking for. Do you really think Trump cares what happens to Tesla or Musk.¬†
¬†Just my opinion.¬†
I'm glad you got involved and had a good experience, going to a protest is a good first step into activism.

But... I'm pretty lukewarm about these types of non-disruptive protests. These are very often indistinguishable from what social scientists and professional activists call ""movements."" A lot of noise is made, but it often doesn't change anything because there's no pressure for anyone to change. Easy to ignore.

The preferred method is Direct Action. This is where you identify the people in the current power structure who have the power to give you what you want, then you reach out to them. They may already agree with you or be willing to listen. If they don't or refuse and all polite/formal channels of communication are exhausted, then you go about finding leverage to apply pressure on them. In our system, people at the top get their power by money and influence, whereas we on the bottom have power in numbers. So we use our power to organize against their sources of power, which in the case of a CEO would be their sources of profits, their shareholders, their political allies, etc. Affecting those is the only real way to put pressure on them that they can't ignore. 

What this means in practice will look different depending on the situation, but some examples would be enforced boycotts, worker strikes, forced shutdowns,  etc. It has to be disruptive, it has to affect their bottom line, it has to persuade the people who have their ear to convince them to give in. If your members start getting arrested, then you're probably on the right track. The police protect the profits and property of the rich, so if the police go after you, you're probably putting pressure on the rich.

Long story short, your protest can become effective Direct Action if you block off those driveways; prevent the dealership from operating and making profit if you want results.
And then everyone clapped.
300 people wow! Change is surely coming now thanks to these heroes

Florida
Aventura mall is a luxury mall in south Florida. It‚Äôs trumps core demographic. Plus I‚Äôm not kidding when I say 80% of the condos there are full of Israeli or Russian citizens. So 1000% his core demographic. It‚Äôs always funny to go to trump towers in sunny isles (next door) and 90% of the residents be Russians who paid to play
Sorry if anyone's got relatives in Florida, but when Musk fully dismantles the EPA and the DoE and they no longer have to worry about those pesky environmental regulations, Florida will be underwater sooner than later.
Were they buying? Seems like driving a Tesla (non Cybertruck) still gets you pegged for being a lib. Must is in a bad place, with his customer base now protesting his company. Great business decision making there Elon

She just pulled by the side of the road and just stopped traffic
Nobody bothered the employees - if anything they seemed to enjoy the entertainment on what likely would have been a chilly, boring afternoon.  Shit, they probably enjoyed having a ‚Äúdo-little day‚Äù.  I know I would.

As for the point, I‚Äôm pretty sure you know what‚Äôs being done by Musk.  Giving an unelected billionaire the ability to dismantle important government institutions (that he knows nothing about) and intimidate/fire federal workers without repercussions is the polar opposite of Patriotism.
Protests have been there too but the paramus one is limited by safety. Not a lot of public space in front of that  tesla, so it cant be as large.
I‚Äôm pretty sure they have been. Search the group for Paramus protest.
They are.  A group called The Visibility Brigade organizes it.  I believe they are there every Saturday.

I don‚Äôt by any stretch of the imagination support that sort of treatment of Tesla drivers/owners. 

However, you can easily pick up a [bumper sticker/magnet](https://www.amazon.com/Bought-Before-Bumper-Magnet-CyberTruck/dp/B0DRGMMLPZ) that might save you the trouble of enduring a future altercation.
Sorry for the late reply - I had a crazy busy start to the week, so I pretty much ignored Reddit for the past few days.  Didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up!

Fadem Rd (the road that intersects with 22 where the Tesla building is) had a BUNCH of parking - there are a ton of industrial buildings back there, and ample curb space.  We wound up parking behind the Staples, I think (not in the Staples lot, but on a cross street: we made a right turn off of Fadem at the first intersection and drove about 100 feet in).  Despite there being hundreds of people there were still a lot of easy places to park.

If you decide to come to the next one, put ‚Äú7 Fadem Road Springfield‚Äù into your GPS - that will bring you right to the general area.  Hope to see you there!
‚ÄúThe left‚Äù knew Musk was a tool and a douche bag years ago, what are you talking about
Elon Musk was not ‚Äúcelebrated by the left‚Äù six months ago. He was hated by the left well before he bought Twitter in October of 2022. That‚Äôs why everyone from regular people to journalists to businesses left Twitter. Maybe keep it quiet if you have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about.

I passed by Eatontown around noon today & saw one lone person protesting. I gave them a few honks in support.
There is one next Saturday where people are going to march towards the governors house (I believe the governor)
There was one last weekend for sure. MAGAts were complaining because the protestors should have been working instead (on a Saturday). Go to teslatakedown.com for future events. https://patch.com/new-jersey/longbranch/anti-musk-trump-protest-outside-eatontown-tesla-dealership-saturday
That‚Äôs much more red territory, so it might be harder to get a turnout, but you should take charge organizing one if you are local. People will start to come and it will build organically. Everyone is probably waiting for someone else to start one.
Eatontown is just a service center, they have a show room but nobody actually takes delivery there.

I was surprised not to see a single protester in Lawrenceville today though

Google Tesla Takedown. It should be one of the first results. That‚Äôs where it started.
Right? No idea why even a few are still buying Teslas. Trump could tell them to eat their own shit and they would fight over who got to use a fork
Taxpayer subsidies...for a guy that hates government largesse and immigration...he sure is an ironic character.
It‚Äôs about making Tesla a toxic brand. The more negativity associated with Tesla, the less people will want to give their money to Tesla. The less money Tesla makes, the less Musk is worth. And the less Musk is worth, the less influence he has on what he currently has been influencing. It might get to the point where Tesla‚Äôs board removes him as CEO if the market continues to reject Tesla as it has been over the last month.
All of these events can result in that. The Board and their inaction to remove him are now part of the problem.
If they make fewer people buy a Tesla, that‚Äôs a good thing, taking money and power away from Elon
Let's start here, which has nothing to do with Elon: [US military fails seventh consecutive audit](https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-fails-7th-audit-in-a-row-eyes-passing-grade-by-2028/).

Oh well, better resolve the problem by firing more disabled vets and cutting funding for food banks.
There‚Äôs a staples or something right next to the dealership but there‚Äôs others too
They use the Home Depot lot next door.
\>Do you really think Trump cares what happens to Tesla or Musk.¬†

Yes, yes he does. He cares so much that he wants to designate Tesla protestors as ""domestic terrorists.""
Those other 87% can vote to kick elon out of tesla and stop the bleeding
This reads like a ChatGPT comment. I am on your team. But sorry, telling someone doing the protest that he/she can pull off safely is not fair. Hoping to get arrested is not a good idea for everyone. I do think standing up right out front is still great! More people showing how they feel can result in others gaining confidence to do the same. Gaging how much support drives bye is helpful info and can motivate even a few people to go home and talk at the kitchen table all about Musk being the enemy can move needles. What good would getting rowdy enough to be kicked out or arrested help? And yes I know the power of all that you said. Grassroots rumblings are still very good! This started with 10 people here n there and it‚Äôs now 100‚Äôs? Good job imo!
Dude, just go back to your game.
What do you care how other people want to spend their time? What‚Äôs it to you?

Doesn't musk firing thousands of federal employees also cost American jobs?
You know that they build way more of them in China than they do in the USA, right?
Username checks out.
Fake news
He‚Äôs the one hurting his business, actually.
Isn't that the point? That Musk is unelected, corrupt, and unvetted, and is doing incredible damage to our federal government? Hit 'em where it hurts.
Umm, it is 100% politically motivated, just like Musk is 100% breaking the law by fucking up our government. So ""we"" are protesting what he understands, his bank account. Hopefully he will be bankrupt soon enough and will leave the government. He also has $83B in government contracts, which unsurprisingly, he thinks are perfectly fine since they help his wallet...

P.S. - If you didn't know, Musk is an ""illegal"" immigrant from South America. He lied to get into the US and then never left.
The protest is about (I think) for the most part about how Elon did the n@zi salute and how he is just not a good person and has been butting in the government and just doing illegal and bad things too.
It is 100% motivated by political reasons. Musk runs a shadow government agency that is a massive security risk. In addition he is looking to get more governmental contracts, shut down organizations that are investigating his company.  

Musk, prior to the election was on deep shit. He used 1/3 of his Tesla stock as collateral to buy Twitter. Twitters value has plummeted, and to pay those loans he may be forced to sell his shares (roughly 200M). That will crater the stock even more .

This is why our president became a car salesman. Elon‚Äôs wealth has already taken a $100B+ loss this year. 

A great man named Billy Ray Valentine said *You know, it occurs to me that the best way to hurt rich people is by turning them into poor people.*

Now that is the political reason.


The other reason is fuck him. He is a Nazi and rather than punching him in the face, punch him in the wallet.
Musk is giving news conferences in the Oval Office. Of course it‚Äôs political. Crazy that that happens when a public figure enters politics.
>  The guy is putting it on the line for the country

Lol he's giving his own companies multi-billion dollar no-bid contracts while cutting programs to help food banks
But there are other people who are giving Tesla owners a hard time. Right now, the message of the protests can be interpreted as ""Tesla=bad"" because whatever intentions exist aren't being made clear.
Thank you for this

> The Board and their inaction to remove him ~~are now~~ *has always been* part of the problem.

FTFY.  Musk constructs the board of directors for all his companies with toadies and lackeys that completely support him.  

He does from the outset what trump is doing with the federal government. Everyone wrings their hands about trump making these cuts to fund tax cuts for billionaire buddies.  It is actually much worse.  He is trying to make the rank and file government employees all into his supporters.  Schedule F run rampant.  I do not know why more attention is not being paid to this effect.
methinks that dick cheney guy who endorsed Kamala wouldn‚Äôt approve of that.
I didn't say the protest was useless, all the things you said are true. But none of those things will get results from the people who have the power to give you the results you want. For that, you'd need to put pressure on Musk. 

People often put many types of protest under the same umbrella, from social media movements to demonstrations to direct action. I'm just explaining the differences. Protests (demonstrations, usually by the general public) are good, but targeted, disruptive protests by determined activists (direct action) are better at achieving the goals of the protest. 

This is a call to find and join activist organizations if people want to get more involved. This is also a suggestion that you may have to be ready to put more on the line (like risk arrest) if you're serious about bringing about real change.

I'm trying to encourage people to get more involved, sorry if that didn't come across. I was pretty tired yesterday afternoon.

I think the reason Teslas are being hated on is loud and clear. Any Tesla owner that doesn‚Äôt get it, may not ever, but it‚Äôs worth the fight to drive it home to Trump that even republicans want Musk out.

Of course - and nobody is denying that there‚Äôs fat to be trimmed from the federal budget.  But taking a chainsaw into surgery instead of a scalpel isn‚Äôt just dangerous, it‚Äôs stupid.


There are ways to make government work more efficiently than by closing entire departments that Americans rely on, or by arbitrarily firing random people, or by shutting down our global influence ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù projects (USAID, Voice of America, combatting HIV, Radio Free Europe, etc), or by stripping much-needed funding from scientific research, or by slashing Medicaid funding, or by closing VA offices, or by understaffing/shuttering SSA field offices, or by eliminating radar sites & vital weather prediction offices at NOAA & NWS, or by ‚Ä¶


This entire situation is nothing but a naked power grab.  It‚Äôs a way to make the rich richer, while keeping the poor poor.  Elon Musk and Donald Trump don‚Äôt give a rats ass about helping the common man or about saving the government money.  If they did, the first thing they would have looked at is the billion-dollar subsidies for already-rich oil & pharmaceutical companies, or the insanely bloated military budget.  


Do you know how many aircraft carriers we have in service?  11.  The next closest countries?  TWO each.  Hell, if you add up *all of the aircraft carriers the rest of the world has combined* it comes to a total of TWELVE!  There isn‚Äôt a person on this planet who thinks the next war will be fought with traditional bombers & fighters - but we‚Äôre still spending billions and billions of dollars maintaining these things every year, and buying new ones at $13 billion+ each.  THAT is where the real waste is - not pediatric cancer research or food pantries or combatting homelessness.


This entire ordeal is as corrupt and as anti-American as anything we‚Äôve seen in our lifetimes, and history will treat it as such - if we fight back while there are still things worth fighting back for.
That is my fault, it is Tom Kean‚Äôs house that they will march to

Tmr he plans on having a friendly luvyduvy conversation with Putin . Like old friends doing a favor. It‚Äôs a conversation about how much land he wants from Ukraine. It‚Äôs sick. Bullying a sovereign nation. Teaming up, Putin won‚Äôt stop there. Just like trump wants Canada Greenland and worst of all Gaza Strip. Sorry this is a rant I could go on forever.

Well there's something we can agree upon.
Ah, my bad. I‚Äôm a poor, so it‚Äôs all a lot of money to me.

I marched in protest of the Iraq War in Manhattan on 9th Ave. I remember people on the right defending Cheney for shooting his friend in the face while hunting. I remember John McCain singing ""Bomb Iran"". I also remember the right getting excited when Trump dropped the MOAB during his first term. 

Elon hasn't even talked of touching the military. What DOGE is doing is sloppy, unplanned, and causing chaos. Not to mention Musk is a horrible human being. He should be running his businesses and taking care of his 14 kids, including the one he disowned.
so then i assume you‚Äôre anti AIPAC as well.
i‚Äôve seen elon rip the F-35 grift so he has it in him. the whole defense contractor system has to be gutted and started new.  piss poor results for outlandish costs.

~$330 a month (thank you Aldi)
Groceries? I‚Äôd say $400-450. Recently started buying my protein from Costco and going to the farmers market for my produce since it‚Äôs cheaper. I‚Äôll be able to tell in another month if I actually saved money.
$50-$70 a week. $12 of that is on energy drinks. 

Aldi - Chicken, rice, potatoes, pasta, pizza, lots of fruit, and frozen veggies.
I live alone so i mostly spend anywhere between $60-$80. There are some instances where I spend like $50 but thats because I didn't need to get many things.
I live alone and I found it's easier for me to frugally eat out than grocery shopping. Working cooking AND cleaning ain't happening. 2 of the 3 are feasible. I choose working and cleaning. Outsource cooking. I used to cook and pay for a cleaning service and that was cool except days where you don't wanna cook and order out anyway. Committing the other way around is a lot easier. You can plan to NOT eat out for 2-3 days if you commit to a hot pot meal or something and eat the leftovers etc. 

It comes down to your day to day habits/modality

eta: sorry i didnt give you a number. i try to spend somewhere between 15-20 per day to cover lunch and dinner. I also intermittent fast until 2Pm (but work dictates 4PM most weekdays) so Its easy for me to stay in that budget on a decent sized meal/platter and eat it more than one sitting (typically 2-3 per meal). So figure $150 a week including tax if youre on the higher end every day. 

Im not gonna breakdown all of my finances here lol but im lucky to have had housing assistance roll over to me once my mother passed away in 2023. I make 58,000/yr before taxes.
I do the single person meal plan which is order $75 of Chinese food and eat permutations of my order for a week.   That's the only way I'm getting vegetables in my diet.  Thank God for the Chinese
I buy for my family but it will probably be about $100 a week. Aldi is great but you‚Äôll need to hit ShopRite or Walmart for some of your stuff too.
My wife and I in central Jersey spend about $200 or so monthly. Most of that is in ShopRite or BJs, and Indian groceries at Patel Bros.

I buy in bulk and eat mostly vegetarian.  Not including the dried bulk beans and lentils I get once or twice a year which comes to maybe 200 bucks, I spend anywhere between 20 -150 bucks a week, because I usually only buy stuff that's on sale. If there's a sale on spices and I need to stock up, that gets pretty pricey.  It averages out to about 60 a week.
I live in Bergen. I spend $200ish on food a month. I buy some things in south NJ when I visit family bc it's cheaper.
$40-$60 on most WEEKS, and that does not include takeout - or food for my dogs.
3-400
Every Sunday I go to Lidl and ShopRite. I spend about $125 a week for a family of four adults (my sister, mom, dad, and myself).
i budget $60 to $80/ week for groceries, but i get Chipotle/Cava/ or Tacoria one night a week usually
This really depends on how many stores I feel like bouncing to & what is in the house. At worst 200ish cause shitrite knocked up prices & I want meat/cheese or wandered over to the baked goods area.


Coldcuts aren't cheap either, your question is missing if you have food restrictions/more interested in processed vs greens but LIDL, ALDI & Grocery outlet all have the same stuff as the big box.
$200-$300 a month.
about 200-300 a month. i suggest to go to aldi. you can get a great bang for your buck there
I live alone in northwestern New Jersey and I spend about $150 a week on groceries.
I budget for $105/week for groceries. Some weeks I do a meal kit, which usually is around $87 but because I‚Äôm single I get more than 6 meals out of the box. I almost never go over the budget but I do have a separate budget for takeout ($100/month) and I do occasionally go over that
50 to 70 dollars a week. I eat the same thing everyday for work. And try not to eat on days off. A lot of water. I budget for my K cups 30 to 35 dollars a month. My one splurge. I
100-200 maybe.  I eat beans, rice, eggs and tofu mostly.  I buy some ice cream.  No chips or extras
If you have one of the indoor ‚Äúfarmer‚Äôs market‚Äù type stores nearby you can get great deals on fresh produce. I know of four: belleville, East Rutherford, totowa and ledgewood. I get out of there with a whole bag of stuff for around $20
For a single person, $60-100/week (closer to $100 for a larger male, maybe closer to $60 if you don't eat much).

Only way you're going to go lower is if you eat out a lot, or make some pretty substantial health sacrifices cost cutting, or limit yourself to purely rice and beans.

I'm assuming you're not eating out often.

Economy of scale for food is real.  It's a lot less per person if you're shopping for 2.  The most simple explanation is making a salad:  Bagged salad is pretty price per oz.  But if you have 2-3 people you can buy the ingredients whole, cut it yourself in a few minutes and get a much lower cost per serving.  But eating it before it turns will be hard as a single person.  You could just eat lettuce, but that's less nutritious than eating a blend of vegetables. Diversity in what you eat is important nutritionally.

Some stuff freezes, and that will help, but ultimately you pay a premium shopping for one.
A fucking lot. I semi smartly moved out my parents once I saved up a decent emergency stash while still investing into retirement so once I moved out I splurged a lil. Now I just break even every month but that‚Äôs still with me putting a decent chunk into retirement savings while more or less leaving that emergency stash as is
for 2 people (who have no access to cooking which makes it more expensive) its about 550 a month for me
I do Factor (keto) home delivery. That's about $70/week. Add in about $100/month *(Grocery Outlet) for essentials.


so about $380/month.¬† No fast food, so snacking. I'm pretty disciplined since weight loss.¬†
About 400 but I‚Äôm vegan so my crap is a little more expensive
$300-$400 I shop a lot at Costco/Trader Joes  so I get a lot that I don‚Äôt even get to go through all month.
I probably spend around 200 - 300, every two weeks depending on what I eat.
For just groceries I would pretty safely bank on 300-400/pp

Going below $300 will be hard unless you are always sale shopping and not buying a lot of meat¬†
Massive range of $50/ week when im cooking everything and making cheap meals like soups to $150/week for a few restaurant meals, prepared stuff like frozen meals or premade salad things. Im also finding that essex county is coating about 75%more than mercer county when i was based  there a few months ago
~$400
Need more info on what your eating generally looks like?
For me I have a pretty limited diet. I'm pretty health conscious and don't need wide ranges of flavor. I spend usually 200 per week on food and I could probably slim that down somewhat to 160 if I really try to limit myself. If you don't care about brand, go for places like Aldi
$550-$700 for me and a toddler.
About 100 week is right.
You can use some of the grocery store apps to check out what you might spend weekly based on what you like to eat. I'm fortunate in my current position I don't have to worry about how much I spend on food, but for a very long time I was scrutinizing every penny. A lot of hot dog Mac and cheese nights. You'd be surprised at how frugal you can get when you need to be.
Figure 100 a week only if you grocery shop. No restaurants.  No fast food
When my kids are away and it‚Äôs just me and my partner, I spend about $100 a week on groceries. We also skip a lot of meals.
No more than $400 a month. I try to buy bulk meats and other common items from wholesale clubs and veggies I get from those ‚Äúfarmers‚Äù markets that are just warehouses. This number also includes me buying something not food in bulk like a wholesale club size of paper towels or detergent and stuff. It pays to shop around and stuff.
Forget Costco if you live alone, those bulk sizes are for big families.  Hit up Aldi for good prices on normal size essentials and snacks.  When you need eggs, get in line at Trader Joes when they open the doors in the morning.
less than $200
~$300 - $350 /mo covers all meals. Amazon Fresh delivery is a godsend. .

That covers all meals. I like to cook, have an efficient system, and do meal prep.

Occasionally I'll pick up some produce on a whim. 

Seriously, limit your purchases to meats, produce, and grains. No premade or preprocessed food. It's wildly healthier AND cheap.
100/week, so 400-500/month
[deleted]
$350
$350-500 depending. Stop and shop has crazy deals!! I stock up on a lot of BOGO deals there.
On groceries alone at least $400 but that doesn‚Äôt include eating out. I‚Äôm fat
$10-$30 per day depending on how frugal you can be.
800 but I also go out to eat a lot.
I eat healthy. Not buying chips, junk food, candies, frozen foods. We buy alternatives to everything that‚Äôs healthy with no seed oils. And no we aren‚Äôt shopping at Whole Foods. Some things organic, something not organic. $1500-1750 a month for 4 people. We don‚Äôt really go out or drink alcohol. So that‚Äôs our trade off. We‚Äôve completely cut out anything with seed oils and processed foods. 

When we ate junk a year ago, we could get away with spending $750 a month, but it was all processed crap at ShopRite and other big stores. I‚Äôve found a local grocer that has better quality products
Make sure the bank account has atleast 5k for a decent casket. üôÉ

I spend about $250 a month. But I‚Äôm not much of a cook and not much creativity.
aldi rocks!
Protein from Costco is absolutely the way to go!! The 3 chicken breast pack for $30 is a solid deal!
I eat off half of that. But I'm very poor so I don't get to eat as often as other people.
How? That‚Äôs what we spend for a family of 4
Yea groceries
Is that per month or per week?¬†

What do you mean by working and cleaning? What are you cleaning?
For the both of u?
HOW?
Hmm that tag.


Its missing a cup of tea.
That‚Äôs really good!
The secret to any supermarket is to only buy what is on sale. For Shop-Rite, the trick lately is to hit the digital coupons hard. Also sales tend to rotate predictably, it if isn't on sale one week, chances are it will be the following week.
live alone in Central NJ about the same.
yup this is about the same for me. It came down to this much in groceris plus cooking and cleaning or spending this much in takeout a week and saving myself the hassle.

I jut started dating this girl thats complicating things XD
Same just about here as well.
*that should read ""no snacking "" sorry
If you are near a shop rite that has shop at home, it‚Äôs not much more than if you went in person and you can have it delivered or pick it up yourself (last option being the cheapest with not going in the store).
Just stack some pallets from a warehouse and give me a funeral pyre, redneck style.
Good lord!
You can buy 6 chickens precooked for that price there. Their rotisserie chickens probably account for half my home mear intake
I‚Äôm sure I could trim it and have been trying to which is why I said I need to recalculate next month. Have been buying less and making much simpler meals.
Good for you.
Per week.
Generally yes. I order from mom and pop restaurants that give generous portions and I usually can split that into 2 servings if you can subsidize other sides at home like making your own rice and veggies at home.
It depends. Single folks generally can't take advantage of bulk discounts on food unless it can be frozen or is shelf stable. Eating out might be cheaper in some cases. Its tough to make certain dishes, because you have to buy that one ingredient that you'll never use for a few months.... except it'll go bad by then.

Generally you'll stick to buying the same core ingredients you can make a wide variety of things with (so you can use them up quickly instead of throwing them out) AND you are content with eating for a few nights in a row. Recipes are generally designed for family sized portions, not single folks.
Depends.  I can stretch a pack of meat to three or four meals usually, but if I make something fancier it could be $20-30 on ingredients for three or four meals which could be similar to some takeout prices.

I agree with another poster that I spend about $60 or so on groceries.
I never ever do delivery unless i factor in that ""luxury tax"" to my budget. If i order take out its takeout or pickup only. Delivery will eat up your funds faster than anything else except maybe drugs and gambling
I lost 125 lbs and counting since May 2024. I switched to whole ingredients foods, no artificial preservatives colors or sweetness. Rough cal counting. Intermittent fasting. I eat whatever but I go out of my way to make sure I can pronounce every ingredient of everything I consume

Yep once in a while it gets expensive for paper towels and toilet paper and other stuff but food stuff isn‚Äôt too bad. 

We‚Äôre also vegetarian and my wife cooks a lot at home.
We‚Äôre both Indian, vegetarian and my wife cooks a lot. So she makes a decent amount of food and we freeze it.
I use an app called Sorted Sidekick from Sorted Food. Its whole deal is to incorporate ingredients over a week through curated recipe packs. So, if you buy a pound of carrots, it will have a use for the entire pound during that week. The nice thing is you can change the number of servings in the app to reduce waste more by only cooking what you need. The 30-day trial is free, and it was twenty a year when I subscribed.
Per month or per week?
bingo. house -- car -- room -- self -- kids (i dont have those) whatever applies, you name it
For paper products, bulk buying at the warehouse clubs can't be beat. Usually just buy the TP and paper towels from Sams Club or Costco.
You spend $50 a week for two people ?! I‚Äôm vegetarian too and there‚Äôs just no way.  How?!what are u eating.
That's nice on paper but personally I would never utilize it enough. My tastes and moods for what I want change so often that's a big reason I don't meal prep. I might prep or buy ingredients for this or that but then never WANT to make that
has to be per week
Oh‚Ä¶ you mean taking a shower and keeping your space clean. Everyone does that‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to choose.
Yep that‚Äôs what we do with BJs.
My wife makes a ton of Indian food and we freeze it.
Even per week seems low, impressively low. I mean in the US you can eat cheap but that would involve foods that are pretty bad for you. If you buy meats and fresh produce I can‚Äôt see 60$ a week making it.
God forbid someone recognize their capacity and stimulate the local economy
There's a difference between upkeep and creating more work for yourself smart guy
I must be doing something wrong!
Well guess what I do.
a 50lb bag of rice is like 25$
Yes but I eat more than just rice. A lot of veg and fruit. 

They‚Äôre eating on $3.35 per person a day! Or $1.12 a meal. No snacks!
Homemade vegetarian indian food is very cheap. It‚Äôs basically rice, lentils/beans, some cooked veggies and flatbread made from whole wheat flour.¬†
I eat all of that (and more) but no way that cheap. Like for Bfast I‚Äôll have Greek yogurt and berries, snack maybe an apple and peanut butter, lunch lentil soup and a pita, dinner stir fry tofu, rice and veg. And maybe some tea and something for dessert. 

It adds up.  I know u hungry now !!!"

There have been protests at their service centers. Were alarms going off, like if people set them off? Or was it like a light show of Tesla owners ""counterprotesting""?

The inspections are not always stored in the elevator. Often times they are stored in the office.
I think the state took over elevator inspections.  The towns don‚Äôt do them anymore.  And like someone above said the current ones are probably in the office and they never took that one down.
Any good sales at Fortunoff?
I do a lot of work in this town for the Fire Suppression industry. It‚Äôs not much better as far as enforcement. Hate to tell you.
I've lived here 32 of my 37 years of life, and I've never been in that elevator.  Thank god.
I definitely wouldn't eat that if I were you.
Elevators are one of the most highly insured components of a building. Just because it was built in the 80s doesn‚Äôt mean it hasn‚Äôt been worked on since then (some buildings‚Äô elevators are much older than that :) )
I think I was there that day. We rode it like mad! Then off to Spaceport followed by the only Chick Fil A in NJ.
The new certs are probably in the maintenance office. The inspector would have shut them down long ago if they continued to operate the elevator without being inspected.
Note: This COC was affixed to the wall above the elevator.
It‚Äôs like the most random little elevator ever
Are we still calling it a mall? That place is just depressing and nearly always empty. How those businesses are surviving or even covering the rent is beyond me. When will this place be torn down or revitalized?

Reach out to Mall Management.

Per Research I found online:

As of February 2024, JLL Properties (Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.) owns and manages the Woodbridge Center mall.

Ownership:
Brookfield Properties previously owned the mall, but sold it to JLL Properties in February 2024. 

Management:
JLL Properties, a commercial real estate firm, is responsible for the day-to-day management of the mall. 

History:
The mall was developed by the Rouse Company and opened in 1971. 

Recent Changes:
Brookfield Properties faced foreclosure on its holdings in mid-2023, leading to the sale of Woodbridge Center.

üòÇüëçüèª. Yes they are very well engineered and by mileage and quantity of passengers are the safest form of transportation in the world by FAR! as for a ‚Äúfree fall‚Äù situation that‚Äôs not really possible. If a traction elevator were to have a complete brake failure it would actually ‚Äúcrash‚Äù UP! As the counter weight is 125% heavier than the car itself. The only 2 instances of a true free fall occurrence were when planes stuck the WTC and cut all cables and when a small passenger plane stuck the Empire State Building doing the same. When I say ALL cables this includes the Overspeed Governor Cable which will actuate mechanical safety jaws that will prevent a crash from an overspeed condition in a downward direction. This particular elevator in Woodbridge is likely a hydraulic driven unit and has no cables instead it uses a piston in which oil is injected using a pump and valve.

Fantastic! I appreciate this a lot, you took the time, and left me far more interested! Especially with my job, I'm constantly on elevators, maybe 12+ rides a day, no exaggeration. So it definitely crosses my mind haha.
Absolutely and it's quite easy.  When you go to the gas station and you buy a gallon of gasoline.  How do you know it's actually a gallon?  And that the owner isn't giving you 0.9 gallons but charging for a full gallon?

The departments of weights and measures check stuff like that.  And it basically comes down to anything that you buy by weight, length, size, or volume.

So the problem ends up growing very quickly with no one watching.
tomato tomato
That should be such an obvious thing, but wow. I just know there's a rabbit hole behind this door. Fuck.
They also take it one step further.  Gas Station owner says he did give you 1 gallon.  You say he gave you 0.9 gallon.  Who's right?

The departments of weights and measurements also maintain real physical examples to compare against.  To settle these kind of debates.

For example at the national level.  The NIST under the Department of Commerce maintains some of these examples.  [You can look at photos here.](https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/kilogram-introduction)

So the are also the authority of what a gallon, a pound, a meter, a kilogram, etc actually are.  So disputes can be easily verified and corrected if necessary.

Now think about how many millions of pounds, gallons, whatever gets shipped in and out of our state every day.  Skimping on products was an age old scam.  We have functionally eliminated (well as much as possible) this problem for our society with Departments of Weights and Measures.
Thanks for all this info! Actually super enlightening, definitely getting the whole picture here now. I just can't imagine the shady dealings that go on. Lots of money to accumulate quietly over the years.
Very happy to share.  People love to shit on regulations and codes.  But the truth is they make our modern world function.

I'm both a vollie firefighter and public telephone engineer.   Unsung departments of government, like weights and measurements, are a lot more important than people realize.

And are hugely influencial on our day to day lives.

If it wasn't for the NFPA I'd be dead right now.  Not joking.

Frustrated with power bill,"I am at my wits end. My family and I have done everything we can to lower our power bill. Anything you can think of, we've tried and implemented. LED low wattage bulbs, energy efficient stove, washer, dryer. Timed power use. Solar photocell lighting outdoors that are independent of our homes power use. We can't swap to solar completely because of several factors, including laws in our town, but even then, in the long run, it wouldn't be worth it anyway due to where our house sits/our roof etc.

This power period, we have literally halved the use of last period. Part of that is due to the temperature getting warmer, but much of it, is just lack of us using literally anything. The bill, is only slightly lower somehow, and more than half of it - is gas delivery. In fact 62% of our bill, is delivery fees. So our bill for the entire house, without this delivery fee, is a little over a hundred dollars. Not bad considering it's a small (cape cod style with the attic converted to two small bedrooms ) three bedroom house with a basement. The delivery fee, has put the bill close to three hundred dollars. 

I've looked for other carriers, but what I've come to find out is that 1. PSE&G will do everything in their power to keep you except reduce prices, by making it nearly impossible to change, and 2. The other carriers, are just as bad, or are indirectly linked to PSE&G anyway.

IDK if it makes a difference, but I have a decent history in energy and construction.  If budget permits;

Openings are REALLY important.  Upgrade when you can.  Choose insulated doors. Steel is great. Get windows that are coated to reflect heat, and Low E to insulate.  Double pane obviously. 

You need to insulate your home from top to bottom.  There really isn't an alternative.  Hire a pro if you aren't able to figure it out.  You can rent machines or hire insulation companies. 

You have options like solar and insane combos like solar plus geothermal.  

If i can give anyone in the world any decent advice is,  don't depend on the state and fed.  This is a new world that we are living in.  Be prepared. 

The cost of goods is increasing.  That goes for the cost of living.  Use your resources ingenuitively.
Thanks for the tips. Please share your protests as well. If the power bill only surges in this NJ, that means the government is incapable of keeping a good quality of life to their people who have already paid significant amount of tax to this state.
A couple of tips:

Get a free energy audit: [https://homeenergy.pseg.com/](https://homeenergy.pseg.com/)

Even though you can't get solar, you can participate in a community solar project and you get an instant 20% discount on the electricity production (not the electricity delivery part). This IS NOT a scam like the 3rd party energy providers that give you a really good deal for the first few months and then jack up your price after: [https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/u/0/reporting/e61544cd-a71b-4121-8263-b958c4843d67/page/p\_2eutes0ctc](https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/u/0/reporting/e61544cd-a71b-4121-8263-b958c4843d67/page/p_2eutes0ctc)

You also mention ""gas delivery"". Do you have a combined electric and gas bill? Perhaps your electric part is fine but your gas portion is what is expensive?
Welcome to the age of charging more with made up fees that had never existed before.as for power the less you use, the more they will charge, they have to support everything and every person that's employed, and stock holders that have to paid. They are not there to lower the price for you/us even if they could they won't. They don't have to answer to anyone.
If your home is well insulated and you can avoid using much electricity during the day, look into PSEG‚Äôs residential load management (time of use) rates!
I saw that in the ""Letter from our President"" note in the PSE G page. Ugh.
Wait until all those businesses pass their 25% on to us as well.
Why June?
That's what I was trying to get to - how do we change that? Doesn't seem right that based on the size of my lot and my square footage, that I should be charged so much for gas delivery. Is that done on an estimated town amount, or is it based on usage? It feels like even if I got my bill down to 50 dollars of usage, at a 62% delivery percentage of my bill, I'd still be paying over a hundred and change a month, for basically using candles and washing/drying clothes by hand.
Pseg does this?
Whatever structure you build
To hold the panels WILL need a permit tho. They don‚Äôt hover above the ground magically
Tell me more‚Ä¶

I will definitely have to look into permitting in my town for something like this.
This is incorrect information. Any solar needs permits.  Even ground mount solar needs zoning and construction permits in any town in new jersey. 

Plus, to have your meter switched, the power company needs to be notified and shown approvals from the building department.

If you do it yourself without permits, prepare for eventually getting caught and fined.
We own. I'll take a look for the square footage, it's very small though. No driveway because our property is too small to have one (our town requires a driveway that reaches the backyard) We have two floors, but only because we converted the attic to two small rooms, and a basement. The last I had done the math, it was  .22kwh but I found out I was way off, and was told it's around .65kwh. I don't know the formula, so that could help lol. What is level billing?
I hear a lot of munis are bumping water bills this year.
Yeah, something like 20 - 25%. At my house we can deal with very little AC. But a baby is due in June, so I don't know how this is going to fly. Maybe global warming will take a summer off - I hope.
That‚Äôs when the price hike is scheduled to go into effect.
You can‚Äôt change it. It is fixed infrastructure.
You would need to check with them or you may need to get an outside energy audit.  I had JCPL do my house like 10 years ago.  They attempt to sell you services but I just took the report - I needed to improve attic insulation and insulated by crawl space and some piping (cost about $500) that I did myself.   The report also showed by living room picture window was another source - about a year later - I have it replaced.
So as long as the solar isn't attached to your home, and isn't grid tied, there's no permits needed. You can get a smart panel like Ecoflow or Anker that acts as a sub panel for battery storage and the grid. This makes your system have the benefits of a grid tied system but isn't technically on the grid, therefore you can DIY without permits or get someone to do it cheaper than usual.¬†


Not to mention there are still 30% solar rebates in effect as of now before the idiot kills the program. Which means 30% of what you spend you can get deducted from your tax bill. Even more if the system is used for a medical critical device such as a CPAP or oxygen.¬†
Level billing would be billing you based on a sliding 6-month average. In the lower use season you are billed a bit more than your usage, and then in the higher use season you are billed less.

The reason I ask about your kWh usage and your billed amount is because it‚Äôs more accurate to track your efficiency change improvements based on kWh usage, not on dollar billing. You can do pretty much the same thing by finding your actual electric charges and tracking those‚Ä¶ but the big point is to remove the distribution charges, taxes and other fees away from the plain ol‚Äô electric usage charges to try to get a little more apples to apples.

One thing that could help, especially if you find this sort of thing fun, is to install power measuring probes on your high use circuits in your circuit breaker panel. Like a Sense, Emporia, Wiser or others. With stats by circuit, you can analyze like crazy and figure out exactly how much each circuit (and this appliances, or rooms) are costing you the most money. 

For instance: heating and cooling is usually #1, hot water heater is usually #2, a clothes dryer is usually #3, and everything else follows from there. The quickest bang for buck might be to replace a traditional water heater with a heat pump water heater. For heating and cooling, the furnace/ac needs to be running efficiently. Is it an old unit? Get a heat pump, where the new ones are wwwwaaaayyyy more efficient than the ones 10+ years ago. From there, how is the home‚Äôs insulation? Think your attic, walls, doors, windows. A weekend project that pays off is sealing air leaks from house into attic and blowing in R-50 or more insulation, which is relatively inexpensive. Some electric companies offer free home efficiency inspections. If they do, get one. 

Btw solar makes way more sense when the home is already pretty efficient. And.. I suggest don‚Äôt get solar unless you can buy it cash, otherwise you‚Äôre just replacing your electric bill with a finance payment and making it harder to sell your home (despite what the sales guy says.)

That‚Äôs a lot, and I bet I said more than one thing worth debating, but if you like geeking out on him efficiency and stats, it‚Äôs possible to make cutting down your electric and gas bill (on multiple fronts) your hobby.
The formula for your all-in cost would be your billed dollar amount divided by the kWh usage in that period. 

The formula for your electric cost would be your only the electric generation and transmission portions of your bill. It would be those two parts of your total monthly billed dollar amount divided by the kWh usage in that period.
One can only hope.
Great. This sucks
Let‚Äôs be real though, they aren‚Äôt upgrading, just band aids where absolutely needed. All while their profit margins keep going higher and higher- at our expense. 

‚ÄúPublic utilities ‚Äú should not have an outlook towards profit. Yes, there should be money set aside for repairs and replacement- but other than those reserves, they should be a break even balance sheet at the end of the fiscal year. 

For the reserves they can even use their outlay for their worst year of repairs as the bar + %. 

This should go for electric, gas, water, and sewer. These are necessary to live. (You can have your home condemned in many states for not having water/sewer/electric)
Ugh. Oh well. Hopefully I can figure something else out, because this is ridiculous.
Thanks for the info. So, if I understand correctly, this would supplement power to my home but not feed excess power back to the grid, and store any excess in batteries?

I‚Äôll check out the brands you suggest and learn more about the ‚Äòsmart panel‚Äô you mentioned. 

I‚Äôll have to see what permits I will need to build a carport with solar roof.
Thank you! I'll definitely look into those things.
Their profit margins aren't increasing. Public utilities profit margin is regulated. And any excess must be reinvested. NJ Democrats are trying to pass legislation so that the excesses are returned to customers.

https://www.assemblydems.com/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=12514#:~:text=Under%20the%20bill%2C%20public%20utility%20companies%20would,to%20customers%20within%2045%20days%20through%20a
Yes, so the you can set the batteries to charge by solar or the grid, but the solar cannot feed back to the grid which makes it safe and that's why you don't need the permits. You can effectively make your power bill $0 but you won't get a check if you produce extra energy. However I know in my area, excess solar isn't allowed bc the grid is ""at capacity"" apparently.. the sub panels I listed take the breakers from whatever you want to power by battery from your regular panel. So you would put your most energy hungry devices such as AC or an EV charger on that panel, and leave non essential breakers in the other panel. I think the sub panel only has space for 12 breakers, but they can be 120 or 240V. Like I've said, I haven't done this yet, but I'm planning on doing it this summer with the way rates are.¬†
[investor dividends and balance sheets](https://investor.pseg.com/investor-news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/PSEG-ANNOUNCES-2024-RESULTS/default.aspx)
You need to stop telling people the wrong information. Even if you're not backfeeding the grid, you would 100% still need zoning and construction for a battery solar system. You're gonna be installing a subpanel and relocating breakers or installing new receptacles, and the solar panels installed need to be correctly rated for wind and snow loads. All requires a permit.

Don't go burning your house down because you found some cheap solar kit on Amazon."

Others said it but I would definitely recommend NJ Transit to NY Penn and then A train or LIRR to AirTrain.
NJ Transit to NY Penn and then the LIRR and then AirTrain...If you time it right it's probably not that much worse than driving.
Whatever you do , leave yourself an epic amount of time ""just in case""
I've taken Uber from Metuchen NJ to JFK when we had 4 people and it was actually cheaper than taking public transit and more comfortable by far.
You could go to Newark airport and take ETS shuttle to JFK...lot less connection/transfers to deal with and faster than going all the way into the city and then out again. Or uber/car/limo services...
Jet ski
Idk about Monmouth to NYC but once you are in the city, I would take the LIRR. I have taken that and the A train and I wish I had done the LIRR sooner. It‚Äôs worth the price and so much faster/seamless.
Where in Monmouth County?  Plenty of trains along the shore that go to Penn Station.
EWR has a lot of flights to many places so if it's less than $100 difference then it's not worth it.
I thought the thread was about JFK the hospital and was VERY confused.
The only option here is a car service - there will be literally ZERO ease or time if you try patching together public transit options. MAYBE a second option would be to take the train to Penn Station then taxi/uber from there.
Funny story. My SIL and family needed to fly out of JFK years ago, we are in No Jersey. Since I worked at JFK over my career and knew the best routes they asked me to drive them. No problem.... Well traffic coming home was very very bad and since I was very familiar with the local roads thru Brooklyn I took the back streets. Well 2 Months later a get a red light ticket. Guilty as hell. And it cost me 80.00
Fly out of EWR instead and take the train directly there ü§å
Car service.
Don‚Äôt.
NJ Transit (North Jersey Coast Line) to Penn Station. LIRR from Penn Station to Jamaica. AirTrain from Jamaica to the terminals. I'd budget 2 hours *minimum* to do that journey. Getting to JFK from Central Jersey is quite the haul.
I agree. I only suggest taking LIRR over the E train. It‚Äôll be much easier with luggage.
Always better to be at the airport bitching about how you have hours to kill than missing a flight.
The one factor is large bags. There is ridiculously little floor space in LIRR coaches and if this is happening at commute time you will be savaged by your fellow riders. A very dumb setup for trains serving the airport.
And even if it‚Äôs more, it still might not be worth the increased hassle. The Belt Parkway can be a bitch and mass transit to/from is a pain if you have anything bigger than a carry-on bag.
It's international so EWR isn't an option
I would budget 3-4.
Tix are already booked so this is a moot point
What destination EWR has a lot on international? Direct to most of Europe, Asia and others."

Flahrida is also Seinfelds dad said it in the show. It stuck!
It‚Äôs the NYC Jewish English accent; it has also influenced pronunciation in northeast NJ, especially since the 1960s. Regional dialects like this are slowly disappearing due to easier access to other dialects via the internet.

Cherry blossom wedding venues in New Jersey?,"Outside of Nanina's in the Park (which is being a little shady with me), does anyone else know of any wedding venues that have cherry blossom blooms in spring?",0.8,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jc0bue/cherry_blossom_wedding_venues_in_new_jersey/,16,1jc0bue,2025-03-15 17:29,"Hard to time anything perfectly with the cherry blossoms. They bloom when they want. Nanina‚Äôs is the only one I can think of and they‚Äôre usually booked solid in the spring-fall.
Skylands Manor at Ringwood State Park

Also has gorgeous lilac garden in May.
I got married at Nanina's in Cherry blossom season, we were like a week after peak blossom. 

Never found them to be shady. Not doing pricing over email/phone is pretty normal in lots of businesses imo, because there's often lots of variables that impact price and it's not worth getting into over phone/email.  

From a seller's point of view, anyone serious about spending that sum of money is going to come view the venue and it's not like Nanina's is desperate for business - they're booked pretty solid for years in advance at certain times of the year. 

Now I'm also local, so dropping in on a Saturday afternoon or w.e was no issue. 

We loved everything about our experience there and would recommend it.
I believe Van Vleck House & Garden in Montclair also allows wedding ceremonies and has beautiful cherry blossoms
Definitely right about the timing. It's tricky to even pick the right weekend to hit up Branch Brook Park.
That's true, but we'd be doing it around the same time of year too because our anniversary is in April. It would be a bonus if we got cherry blossoms haha

Nanina's is beautiful but I find it odd they refuse to mention cost until you tour the venue. It seems shady to me how little information they want to give over email
were cherry blossoms still visible a week after peak out of curiosity? I'm glad your experience went well, perhaps I might be reading too much into the lack of pricing. I'm just slightly scared they're giving everyone different prices depending on the vibe they get from the couple.

Yea I'm like 4 hours away but grew up in the area. I want to still visit just because it looks like a beautiful venue and want it to work but I'm being cautiously optimistic.
I think that‚Äôs probably standard. You can always look up pricing on the knot for an idea if it‚Äôs in budget.
https://www.herecomestheguide.com/wedding-venues/new-jersey/naninas-in-the-park
>were cherry blossoms still visible a week after peak out of curiosity?

Yes! There's different species of blossom, and they go at different times. Peak is just when the most varieties are going simultaneously. We have blossoms in tons of our pics, including at the altar. 

>I'm just slightly scared they're giving everyone different prices depending on the vibe they get from the couple.

They're not.

Bonus story to put you at more ease. My wife and I desperately wanted to get married at Newark Museum. One of our favourite places, and we know they have done weddings. We also thought given it was a bit of extra money in off hours, and not a wedding industry place, it would probably be cheaper than a wedding specific place. So went in for a visit. Lady was so incredibly unprofessional, and they had all sorts of wild expensive requirements, and a set caterer that wasn't doing it for me. We walked out of there disappointed, and I told my wife ""let go check out Nanina's anyway, we probably can't afford it but who cares"". Turns out it checked all our boxes, had our date available, and cost less than the museum. So we signed up for our date with a deposit that day. We almost didn't even go
I'm not sure it's standard, I've reached out to 12 or so other venues now and all of them had pricing packets they emailed me immediately without me even having to ask

I think it may be within my price range on a weekday, but I'm not sure about a Saturday. :/

Edit: crazy how people downvote anything and everything instead of explaining how 12/13 isn't standard. But alas, Reddit has gone downhill. I saw someone on a different sub say their mom died and they got downvoted LOL...what can you do
Ah nice, spring is such a beautiful time of year to get married.

wow yea I would've expected Newark museum to be cheaper for the same reason. If you don't mind me asking, did you two get married on a weekend or weekday? Quite a few venues we were reaching out to had massive savings during the weekdays. Park Chateau when we emailed them had a $100,000 difference between a Saturday wedding vs a weekday haha
Good luck
We got married on a Saturday. We did the morning. Was definitely cheaper than the evening and also had a smaller #minimum.
Was 5 hours enough time for everything? I noticed they do 5 hour slots for morning, afternoon, evening.
I believe it's only 2, morning and evening - but maybe they do 3 slots when it's just reception and no ceremony. We did both reception and ceremony

Yeah it felt like plenty of time. Our guests raved about it. We were being pulled around in a million directions so it flew by for us, but that's normal. Didn't feel rushed or like it dragged on forever"

What's more crazy is the people from Jersey this this is normal
When they see all the NJ drivers not following any laws
Because they expect the roads to operate like they do at home, where you make a left from the left lane.
It's actually very understandable. Out of state, getting in the right lane to turn left on a regular highway and not an interstate is extremely rare. Also you don't need a painted arrow to indicate a turn lane, so that would be completely irrelevant. So to answer your question, it's national traffic norms. Have you ever driven outside if the state? You may find it to be a different experience.
The reason it eludes out-of-state drivers is because jughandles are inefficient, costly, and harm the environment. Somehow all the other states had this figured out a long time ago. (Hint: left turn lanes with protected green arrows work better)

"Town/City Noise Ordinances should explicitly mention ""bass"" sounds","I realize it might be hard to actually codify a particular bass volume limit into law. But I really wish bass sounds could somehow be addressed in ordinances.

I think a lot of times, neighbors who mean well do not adequately understand that even if their TV etc. seems to be at a reasonable volume, the rumbling of bass sounds creates vibrations and an unsettling hum  of background noise.

Determining whether the general volume is too loud seems to mostly be a matter of common sense. But I suspect a lot of people have a hard time realizing that bass is the main culprit. Just my guess.

Really you'd want it to be ""low frequency vibratory sound including but not limited to 'Bass'"".

Low frequency bass is usually between 30 and 50 Hz. The lowest we can hear is 60Hz generally. That's not the lowest we can feel though. 

Low bass frequencies (below 20 Hz, though some can be felt down to 16Hz) have long wavelengths and can move a significant amount of air, creating vibrations that are felt rather than heard.

There's a chart here https://makingnoiseandhearingthings.com/2016/08/15/what-sounds-you-can-feel-but-not-hear/
High pitches are very directional. Bass is perceived as omnidirectional. It is why subwoofers can be placed in the corner of your family room and fill the space  while the center speaker with voices is pointed at you .

So on my bill I‚Äôm getting charged 6 dollars for service charge and then as you can see on my bill it says .06 cents am I getting overcharged ?
I haven‚Äôt asked yet cause I didn‚Äôt know if I was missing something. But I guess I‚Äôm not misunderstanding that I‚Äôm getting charged more?

Edit to add I just got this bill today and just noticed it I will be calling on Monday to ask
Nothing. Just wanting to make sure I‚Äôm not getting charged more than i should be.

Solar maybe? But nothing really lol
Energy independence: but going solar is really the only hedge you can do as a homeowner that won‚Äôt end up costing more.
It's always been a thing, it's mainly for the usage of the power line that may not be owned by the utility company.

IE PSE&G uses a Verizon Telephone pole to deliver electricity to your house .
It‚Äôs already been a thing honestly that part they will ALWAYS do lol you can get it supplied through to someone else
You‚Äôre so lucky you rent with electric included. I have never heard of that before. Water is usually the one that‚Äôs paid for because it‚Äôs the cheapest.
PSEG always had a delivery charge.
It is to pay the costs of those wires, poles, transformers, etc.  as well as for PSEG 's employees and contractors who maintain those lines and restore power when it goes out.  This has been the case for a long, long time.
The fuck we are.
üòÇ I‚Äôm trying to save money everywhere and anywhere I have an EV car so lol two cents would have helped somehow LMAO but I understand now that this delivery charge is probably accurate cause of all the other charges included in it that I didn‚Äôt realize were needed to be added ü´†
[deleted]
You really should because their bill is very difficult to dechiper and only they can tell you for sure
fair enough. but the rate is the rate.

I think if your goal is to make sure you're not getting charged more than you should be, you should install a power monitor like Sense to make sure your usage is reflecting the same the power company says you're using.
Agreed. I was more so getting at the consumer has no control over the rate really. I know you can buy energy from different 3rd parties, but even that's a crap shoot.
It‚Äôs almost always the other way around. These poles belong to utilities and they charge the broadband and any other company for usage of their poles.

Bread is just an example. What I meant was (as you know) the price of everything has skyrocketed, but everyone seems to be fixed on this utility issue. This is one of the least likely things that will come down in price, so all the crying and moaning over it and complains to BPU aren‚Äôt likely to change things. In fact the rates are going up in a few months. Is anyone writing to Pepperidge Farm about $5 for a loaf of $1 bread? Is anyone not buying bread? Nope.

Not saying that any of this is right or good or correct for consumers, it just is.
Does pseg have a an off peak charging rebate? I have Atlantic City electric and get a rebate for charging during off peak  hours.
I understand that part but as you stated it looks like my bill is stating .062 ish and you‚Äôre stating .045 so I‚Äôm getting charged more? That‚Äôs the consensus?
I understand it now better from one comment that someone left which made me feel even dumber than I already felt ü´†
Yes I put a power monitor in recently. I was just asking about the charge didn‚Äôt know how it was adding up to the 6 cents but as one comment pointed out it is a bunch of things to add to them which makes more sense now which I‚Äôm fine with. I wasn‚Äôt concerned on my usage amount being inaccurate just was wondering if the rate was inaccurate that‚Äôs all
Buying from third parties is almost always a bad idea.
It's almost always yes.
Water isn‚Äôt separated in a multifamily? I never look at the set up when I‚Äôm in my basement.
>What I meant was (as you know)

Actually, I didn't until you finally took the time to explain your assumptions. Thanks so much!

>Is anyone writing to Pepperidge Farm about $5 for a loaf of $1 bread?

I have no idea.

>Is anyone not buying bread?

Actually, I stopped buying bread about a year ago and got into baking! =)
Yes, so I put in for it but it‚Äôs going to take 3 months for them to look into it giving me the money back lol ü´†
[deleted]
I guess how would you ever determine if your rate is inaccurate?
Hence the comment of crap shoot
It takes some time but will be worth it. The almost 50% discount at night for charging is great.
I did read your comment but I don‚Äôt understand any of it. I thought distribution and delivery meant the same. So excuse me for being ignorant.
Well it stated .045 cents for distribution and my delivery said .065 basically so I thought there was a discrepancy but one comment showed that the .065 includes a bunch of other charges that is in the document that I had to go and mathematically add up and it go to that .065 so it‚Äôs accurate just didn‚Äôt know and was unaware until I was able to figure it out by reading it a million times ü´† I am little slow to comprehend
I can‚Äôt wait üòÖ
[deleted]
Fair enough yeah. I guess in my mind when it comes to utility bills, the line item fees to me are meaningless. They're gonna charge whatever they're gonna charge.

The only thing I feel like you have control over is usage reported by them.
Yup at again like I said I didn‚Äôt understand it as many times as I read it. I thought the other chargers were not included in the delivery/distribution cause I THOUGHT they were different programs that didn‚Äôt pertain to me. It‚Äôs pretty easy to misunderstand this me coming to ask and get an answer. But as stated FORGIVE MY ignorance.
Yeah I‚Äôve been more aware of this as a newer homeowner‚Ä¶ I feel myself acting like my father did when he was alive ü´†"
Finally Approved NJ State Refund.,"After waiting over 5 weeks of processing I called Thursday 03/13 spoke to a lady who told me I needed to verify my return information. She had me read numbers from certain lines and finally had me confirm my banking info. Left me on hold for a few minutes then told me my refund was released and I would just have to wait for an update. Well today I woke up to a DD of 03/20. Not saying this is everyone‚Äôs case but a lot of people who filed mid to end of Jan like me accepted 01/29 are still processing and might need to call and verify like I did.

Thank you! I have been stuck in processing for over 6 weeks! I will call on Monday.
Same here, was stuck on processing since January so I called this past Friday 3/14 and was told I needed to answer some questions off the 1040 and also a couple of other things including DD info. I ¬†file myself every year using Freetax USA including this year.¬†
I never received any notification from the State or Freetax USA that I needed to contact the State of NJ regarding the situation ü§îHence it‚Äôs done¬†
Now I‚Äôm just waiting for a DD date.
Yeah I‚Äôm going to call tomorrow thanks
Still not update today still processing. I filed a very basic return this is NUTS. and when I call it keeps telling me the call volume is too high and hangs up. I want my money!!
I have been stuck on processing forever as well. Tried calling today but they close at 4PM. Plan on calling first thing in the morning and will post an update. I have never had to call to get anything verified or released so this seems out of the ordinary. Thanks for posting this though I probably would have waited a couple of more weeks before I picked up the phone.
Guess I'm calling tomorrow cause it's been almost 2 months since it was accepted
I called multiple times and they keep telling me I don‚Äôt need to add any information and to just continue to wait and it‚Äôs been almost 2 months of waiting need it asap
Yeah I was just talking about that with my daughter I need to fix this and hopefully next year I won‚Äôt have to go through this again
Did you get it on the actual date they gave you?
Absolutely call them till you get ahold of someone let me know if they make you verify so we can help the next person out!
Hopefully you get one this week which you should!
Did you receive it yet?
Yes call so many people need to verify and have no idea!
The lady on the phone said the major updates are Thursday‚Äôs and Saturdays don‚Äôt loose hope
You should definitely try calling the state. I submitted 6 weeks ago on TurboTax and have been on processing since then, never got any notification/letter that anything was wrong. I just called this morning and they told me they were missing documents ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)so I had to reupload all of my docs on the state website and they said it can take up to 90 days. They open at 8am, I made the call at 7:58am because the menu you go through before talking to a human takes about 2 minutes and when I finally got passed that I didn't have to wait on hold at all. I tried calling a few times last week but kept getting ""we cannot connect you to the call center goodbye"", so if you can't get through maybe try that strategy! Good luck
No problem I‚Äôve seen so many that had to verify this year I‚Äôm not sure why they are doing this and why they aren‚Äôt sending any notices. I wonder how many people are stuck processing and have no idea they have to verify.
Yeah I would call for sure
Wow that‚Äôs crazy I hope you update Thursday or Saturday.
mines also still processing from early February. I don't NEED it urgently. But $300 is $300. If I owed them they'd be up my ass about it because Murphy needs to fund his McMansion.
Yep, they can wait for my money.
Honestly I filed it myself and admittedly didn't check up on it after I got the notification that it was accepted until I got the notification from my bank that it was direct deposited into my checking account. So I don't know what the timeline was between them approving the return to me getting it.
Wasn‚Äôt the case with me. Just seems I have to wait
I finally got through, they said everything looks good and its moving along just keep checking.
Wow so they were just going to wait till you called to let you know there were documents missing wow some people can‚Äôt call cause of work and life that‚Äôs just crazy the fact that they don‚Äôt send any notices out is so concerning they just want to hold on to that money as long as they want!
Yea that‚Äôs just inexcusable to not send some sort of notice via mail.
That‚Äôs awesome I hope it‚Äôs like that for me next year lol. I never would have known I had to verify if I didn‚Äôt call they never sent a notice or anything I just noticed I was stuck on processing for quite a while almost 6 weeks  and just got this gut feeling I should call and sure enough lady said I was flagged for manual verification and did it over the phone asked me all these questions on my return that was Thursday 03/13 and by today 03/15 had a deposit date. I didn‚Äôt even go to checking for accuracy I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs what they did over the phone with me made sure everything matched.
If you don‚Äôt see any updates this week or the next call back I was told the same thing 2 weeks ago and nothing that‚Äôs what made me call back and I had to verify.
literalllllyyyyy did they think i just wouldn‚Äôt notice the $2k+ i was missing ü§™ü§™ i‚Äôm sure they would‚Äôve sent a notice eventually‚Ä¶like‚Ä¶on tax day üôÑ
Yeah they are hoping people don‚Äôt call or forget  so they can hold on to those funds a bit longer cause I just can‚Äôt comprehend why they are doing this to so many
I've been using freetaxusa for the last few years. Federal is free and state is like 15 bucks. Haven't had any issues. That said if there are issues they alert you via text/email. My taxes aren't particularly complicated though so if you're having issues like that you may want to consider using an accountant or similar to file for you.
I‚Äôm seeing a lot of issues with the returns that are on the larger side I don‚Äôt think it a coincidence lol they are trying to hold that money up as long as they can!
Unable to transfer your call to the call center every single time I‚Äôve tried to call so far this morning. That is absolutely insane and should be illegal. Do you recall which phone number you got through on and which menu prompt got you to the correct person?
I finally got in touch with them via the (609) 292-6400 and hitting prompt 5 from the main menu. It went exactly as you had mentioned. I needed to verify name, social, and various dollar amount from specific lines on the NJ return, as well as direct deposit information. Unreal they they arent sending out letters to people whose returns are hung up like this.
I did I paid a professional to do them that‚Äôs why I though I would t have any issues but maybe it‚Äôs because I just moved to NJ 2 years ago and it‚Äôs my first time filing state taxes here. I work in Philly still so they probably wanted to verify everything throughly before approving it.
as if we don‚Äôt already pay enough taxes in this state üò≠üò≠lol
Call (609) 292-6400 promo 5 it will transfer you to a live person
Awesome I knew it they are just holding peoples return for verification wow that‚Äôs why I put the post up makes me so mad! I‚Äôm so glad you verified now you will update with a deposit date soon. Let me know if you get a deposit date or you update to checking for accuracy the next payment dates are the 25 and the 27th if you update with checking for a accuracy don‚Äôt worry you will have a date that following Thursday with a deposit date for 04/01 or 04/03  I caught on yo their little game
Exactly we are giving them an interest free loan but when it comes to paying back forget about it!
How did you get a hold of someone. I keep calling the number and hitting 5 and it keeps saying call volume is too high and they aren't available. Did you call at a certain time. I'm so piased I need my money."
Uber Pet reliable?,"Hi, 

I‚Äôm flying into Teterboro airport in a couple of months with my golden retriever and will need to get to Newark airport with my dog to pick up a rental car. 

Getting a rental car directly from Teterboro is insanely expensive and the prices I‚Äôm seeing for a pet taxi online are around $300. Which seems crazily high as google maps is telling me it‚Äôs a 30ish minute drive. 

I‚Äôm thinking to use Uber Pet, does have any experience with this in NJ and could tell me how reliable it is?

"Franklin Township Republican Club President asks for a ‚Äúhand up, not a handout‚Äù after months of distasteful yard signs","If you‚Äôve been in the Franklin-Somerset area within the past year or so, you‚Äôve probably seen at least one of Rob Kashinsky‚Äôs signs. He‚Äôs had a few, ranging from ‚ÄúFUCK BIDEN‚Äù to ‚ÄúFUCK KAMALA and FUCK YOU FOR VOTING FOR HER,‚Äù and most recently, ‚Äúboys have a penis, girls have a vagina.‚Äù At some point in the election cycle last year, his sign burned down. Kashinsky is adamant that it was an act of arson, and extended this opportunity on social media:

‚ÄúEveryone deserves an opportunity for forgiveness. So do you. If you have the courage to ring my doorbell and apologize to me, you have my absolute word. My word that I will NOT press charges against you for the arson you committed. Further, I will NOT reveal your identity to anyone. As an offer of peace, strength and honor; I will leave the previous sign in retirement. I will replace it with a positive message of my choosing, which you will repaint every week until the election is over. That is the one and only circumstance under which the sign will stay down, and the one and only circumstance under which I will not press charges. If you want the sign to come down that badly, I trust you will take me up on this rare offer as you are the only person who can make it happen. This offer is non-negotiable and evaporates after 1 week from the date it is posted. The ball is in your court. Contact me to schedule our meeting. Forgiveness is more powerful than hate. Time for healing. I offer the opportunity to change the trajectory of your life. To remove guilt and offer forgiveness. May God Bless You and Keep you Safe. Rev. & Mrs. Kashinsky‚Äù

Needless to say, the sign did not stay down.

Recently, Kashinsky has been asking for donations via GoFundMe for a wheelchair accessible van for doctor‚Äôs visits, shopping, and school.

Man if only there was some sort of medical system that everyone paid into and was doled out to the people who need it by the government. It could cover primary and secondary medical expenses for everyone, regardless of their political ideology. It would only cost like a little bit for every citizen but could help the people who need it most. Man, if something like that existed, it would really help this guy with his medical costs! A real shame it doesn't, I wonder what political party is responsible for that.
I absolutely abhor the actions of people with YOUNG CHILDREN who put up these kinds of signs. What the hell are you trying to teach your kids??

Most likely burned his own sign. Passed by his ‚ÄúBoys have a penis‚Ä¶‚Äù sign a couple of weeks and was so pissed off at the cruelty of it . The sign is pretty big and had to cost a lot to make, and fuck the sign maker too, by the way. I was happy to see many of his neighbors have anti hate signs on their lawns.

For multiple years, his crappy signs have polluted the commute.

The gall and nerve to make this request of his fellow neighbors.  He deserves every flat tire his wheelchair occurs! He voted to screw himself and others like him over. Reap what you sow!
I‚Äôm sorry he‚Äôs disabled on a human level, but sometimes in life you get what you give.  I sincerely hope that people would find a more worthy recipient of their charity than this prick.

I live next to a guy like this on a busy road. Throughout the day MAGA nuts drive by and wail on their horns. Doesn‚Äôt matter the hour. We had one morning commuter who did it at 5:45 every single morning for about 18 months. Made my pregnancy hell and woke my baby up constantly after he was born.
I do not wish ill will upon anyone but this guy very clearly was asking for it.
Omg. I went to high school with that first donor name. Another MAGA.
Hand him these nuts
Fucking welfare Queen
Let's all send him some bootstraps.
Curious as to where is the line for him where a hand up turns into a hand out.
Wheel chair accessible means he's a DEI recipient. Trump doesn't like "" those people."" Ahhhhh, the irony.
Well, on a human level I wish him good health. On a political level he‚Äôs a jag off.

Why don't he pull himself up by his wheelchair straps 

Why should we contribute to his yard signs
Looks like he spent all the nurse money on renovating his house.  
Using his kids to garner sympathy.
Being a general shit person.
His toxicity (and what I suspect to be horrendously managed diabetes) has caused him to become a bilateral amputee and end stage renal failure.  You would think a nurse (who thought himself an allstar) would know what happens when you don't treat high sugar levels. There are signs and symptoms before you lose your feet, kidneys and have a stroke. 

He was able to get that nice power chair...you would think he could afford a used minivan that's been outfitted with ramps to accommodate his hateful ass.  

I hope he gets more comments telling him what a POS he is than donations.

I drive by the signs almost every time I drive  home from work. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how he is able to have a huge sign out in public that has the words penis and vagina without being fined?

I didn't burn his sign down, but that response would make me want to burn down every sign he put up forever. Fuck that clown.
He deserves the anguish he‚Äôs experiencing imo
Best I could do is Thoughts and Prayers
Thoughts and prayers, asshole
No hate.. but if I‚Äôm donating to you so that you can get a wheel chair accessible van than that‚Äôs a fucking handout. I don‚Äôt have issue with that but like let‚Äôs not sugar coat it so that you feel less like a hypocrite
You get what you give.
Here‚Äôs your sign.

Strong dark triad vibes from this ‚ÄúRev.‚Äù Hmmm‚Ä¶
I was wondering the sort of caricature  that lived there!  I live about 20 minutes away.  He‚Äôs much younger than I imagined .  Hopefully he‚Äôll be able to pull himself up by the bootstraps and hustle (as in get a 2nd or 3rd job) to get the money he needs .  Ridiculous!
And honestly by the look and size of that kitchen it does not look like a go fund me is needed.

It‚Äôs always about the con with these people. Just like his big daddy Cheeto. If someone as stupid as that orange üçä fritter can fool people then so can this scammer. Cons gonna con.
This sounds like socialism, sounds like he needs to pull himself up by where his bootstraps should be.
Why does he look exactly like I thought he would look? Don‚Äôt fascist nutjobs have a look other than pudgy bearded doughboy?
LOL.  Look at him beg.  So desperate.

This sub is so fucking weird I swear
Who will check his daughters genitals???
Weird battle to pick. Sit back and look at this from a human perspective
I passed by this sign like 2 weeks ago. I don‚Äôt live in the area, just passing through. My first thought is, who besides a pedophile, is worried about a child‚Äôs genitalia. Such a weird sign for your lawn
Big ass MAGA flag and no American flag speaks volumes
In January I saw the huge ""Trump 2024 Take America Back"" flag at Cedar Hill - nearly spit out my Starbucks!
Truly. It actually enrages me. When they need it, it's 'help'. When others need it, it's a 'hand-out'. Fuck him.
Literally trying to co-opt pro-social slogans to beg people he hates for money because him and his ilk have made sure that our healthcare system is so fucked up that GoFundMe is almost entirely medical bills.

This was my first thought. The kids seeing those signs. As a New Jerseyian I'm very comfortable with the cursey words, but there's a time and place. Don't put signs with the word fuck on them when you have two little kids and probably have school busses going by. And do we really need signs talking about genitalia? I feel bad for everyone that has one of these people as their neighbor.
Great language from a proclaimed spiritual leader.
> This hate monger is a minister?

Are you really surprised?

I'm not saying there aren't good ministers. But when I pay attention to the loudest, most hateful voices in the country right now? I see a lot of crosses.
You should have seen my face when I saw the ""Rev. "" at the end of that. Who are the people under the guidance if this man? He doesn't need to ve any kind of leader.
People in trump's cabinet already called disabled people a waste of money. 

I have zero empathy for him.
I don't hope that. I want his kids to have free healthcare, free good food, and free high-quality education. Whether he likes it or not.

Unfortunately he doesn't and the people he voted for won, so he'll get what he voted for. Whether he likes it or not.
We have one here too, tho not surprising bc it‚Äôs Florida. He had a F*CK Biden flag for 4 years, along with confederate flag . His  house also doubles as a bus stop for k-12. 

Trump flag went up immediately after he won. That‚Äôs down now but the confederate flag still flies 

I know ppl think everyone here is GOP. Not true. I‚Äôve lived on same street for 25 years, we were the only dems on it for 2 decades. Now Dems out number GOP on my street. Doesn‚Äôt change FL politics but it helps me to have like minded folks on my street.

I have a GOP friend, 2 doors down. We got into over Trumps  first term. We agreed not to talk politics. Well she has slowly started bringing it up and she has voters remorse. I could go there but I don‚Äôt. 

I did ask her if she could make it without SS and got a hard NO. Was so hard to NOT say well you FAFO. We trade recipes and plants. I just don‚Äôt get how she voted for this. Sure he said he wouldn‚Äôt touch those programs but he‚Äôs not exactly a truth teller.
A while back, there was this one house in the back roads of Mount Olive that had a flag right out on the road that said ""fuck your feelings"". Pretty close to the high school and not too far from the middle school either. All the kids had to see that every day. No idea if it's still flying.
I was thinking the same!
Edit: I just assumed the kids in the photo are his. I have no idea if he really has kids. But, oh, I do know of folks in my town WITH YOUNG KIDS that do this kind of crap.
I saw a doughy looking guy with a 2 year old looking daughter. His t shirt said ‚Äújust a new dad trying not to raise a liberal daughter.‚Äù Who the hell buys a shirt like that? I assume he had it custom made.
But dogs are amazing creatures who are unequivocally loyal. They don't deserve that comparison.
Oh, 100% he burned his own sign. All these creeps have a persecution fetish.
Take a drive down Demott towards Easton. He‚Äôs on the right. Despicable.
No, no, there isn‚Äôt a line. It‚Äôs a hand up for him, it‚Äôs a handout when it‚Äôs for someone that *isn‚Äôt* him
Close, on Demott Lane.
He commented on the article sharing his GoFundMe too, wild.
i don't know if it applies to this particular guy, but if you receive disability benefits (SSDI) you're required to carry medicare part A (you're eligible to sign up for full coverage, but at a minimum they make you take hospital coverage).
Just like he did?
He picked the battle when he started supporting fascists.
I agree. Absolutely do not agree with his politics but try being a little more human... who are we to judge and decide whether a person is worthy of help? We've all done things we aren't proud of in life, let's try to remember that and have empathy (even if he doesn't!)
GOP = genitals obsessed party
That genitalia sign should have been at least two police visits and a hard drive confiscation
I passed by recently too and don't even live in the area. I saw the ""hate has no place here"" signs then this one. I thought that's such a weird sign to have.
My same thought. So creepy.
Yea I saw that one and went ""cops should give that house a surprise visit""
For the months leading up to the election, they had the American flag on top, then a maga flag underneath. I hated it, but was like ""Whatever, you got freedom of speech just as much as I do"" 

Then the wednesday after the election they were both replaced by a big ass MAGA flag (bigger than the American flag they had up). Lasted exactly a week which leads me to the ongoing question: Did they take it down because they were getting the riot act from people in town, or did they always plan to have it up for exactly a week. Probably the latter, but I wouldn't put it past Franklin residents to have raised hell.
Yea I went from being moderately perturbed to absolutely pissed. I still give the business a middle finger when I drive by (daily).
I hate that ‚Äúhand out‚Äù became this politicized and yucky word. We are not animals only focused on survival it is ok to help others and it‚Äôs ok to take help when needed
If they're anything like the rest of the country, the house is probably triple mortgaged and the countertops are temu, and also he owes 7k on them still

Oh I agree. Don‚Äôt put curses on bumper stickers or signs. Some elementary kid parent does not need to have to answer ‚Äúmommy what does fuck biden mean?‚Äù I have  anti musk and Trump stickers on my vehicle. But I refrained from the ‚ÄúTrump still sucks‚Äù one (which I dig) because I don‚Äôt want kids to see it. And that‚Äôs pretty tame.
It does explain the bit at the end, though. ""Think your opinion is righteous? Give me money to prove it."" Sounds like the way a Christian spiritual leader thinks.
I talked to an 85 year old nun who said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get me started on this liberal pope. I hate this pope!‚Äù Short conversation.

I'd say the latter.  The only time it was messed with was when his Fuck Kamala sign was burned.  He also has a classic car for sale on his yard.  I think he was goading people into committing vandalism.  I also think there's a possibility that the vandalism was committed by him or someone he knows to gain publicity.  He ran for town government and has been doing this shit for years.  People did raise hell and wanted the town to step in and remove it but of course they can't.  

Good news is the Mayor, Assemblyman, and a town council member bought a bunch of Hate Has no home here signs and if you live in Franklin they will put it in your yards.  If anyone wants one DM me and I'll put you in touch with them.
One house by me decorated for the inauguration. Full on red, white and blue lights, flags, spot lights, the whole shebang. It might be Ocean County but I always see him out in his yard because that's where people keep throwing trash.

Glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one who does that. For me, it‚Äôs the shitty house with all the trump signs and flags near the Cheesequake state Park entrance. Every time I pass his house, I flip it the Jersey bird.
Thanks. That makes me feel a little better as I sit in my basic but affordable rental apartment.
Def this. As someone who works in FinTech and can see credit reports (anonymized), 15k is the average credit debt
I get 100 ads mailed a day to get us to take out a loan on our home.

I‚Äôm not opposed to that but only if I truly needed it would I ever do that. But I do know people who pull out loans to buy cars and furniture or do silly Renovations like kitchen upgrade.

It is not free money but boy do they try to sell it like you‚Äôre borrowing from yourself.  Also that kitchen could be somebody else‚Äôs? As the person at the sink is clearly a dude.
Literally bought countertops in the last year. Probably had to buy two slabs, and those look like the middle tier stuff that I bought. If I had to guess it was probably in the realm of $4000-$6000 including installation.

He says, ""‚ÄúEveryone deserves an opportunity for forgiveness"" in connection with burning the sign. Well, he can go ahead and forgive himself because I don't believe for one minute that anyone went on his property to burn that sign. I guess being vile and offensive wasn't enough to get attention, so he needed a publicity stunt.
[deleted]
Oxymoron. The attire is medieval, and all the decrees and pomp and circumstance are at least a millennium old. But for this old nun, he‚Äôs a virtual rabble rousing hippie.
It absolutely could have been an act of vandalism.  The things that I thought were the most strange aspects of it was the fire was set at like 830 on a Sunday morning.  The only thing affected was the sign and the plywood that held up the sign.  He had already had signs up for months if not over a year at that point.  Now I don't think Kash himself did it.  He's wheelchair bound.  I think one of his political friends probably did it.  Possibly without even his knowledge.
I'm not arguing that quartz is expensive comparable to other materials, just that for a kitchen this size it's probably in that price range. Granite can also be cheaper than some nicer quartz.
I love  my Formica countertops.  Easy care, looks great even after 25 years.  Significantly cheaper than alternatives too.
For a lot of people, it‚Äôs knowing you could have gone cheaper but didn‚Äôt that makes them feel good. Utility sort of goes out the window when you have expendable income‚Ä¶
Yeah.  Also the Jones family next door got the upgrade, so‚Ä¶.   I can afford the fancy stuff but I actually like the Formica and figured that ‚Äúfancy counter‚Äô money was better spent elsewhere or saved for a rainy day.  But that‚Äôs a very old-fashioned approach I guess."

Looks like the housing marking in NNJ isn‚Äôt cooling anytime soon.,"When I went for a house visit, there were many people interested in the house. Good house. Good interior. Good location.

Montclair?  Not surprised if it is.  I've been here over 20 years
We just need more

![gif](giphy|VosWGUIIptLWcigbId)
Yeah you pretty much have to be loaded to get into towns like Montclair, Glen Ridge, Maplewood, South Orange, Ridgewood and the like. There is just so much demand‚Ä¶even before covid
I live in Gloucester County

Bought my 4 bdrm  2 level house back in 12/2019 for $90k

The house 3 doors down from me is just one level with 3 bedrooms just sold for a little over $300k

Wasn't even renovated,there's no garage and very little yard space.

  
It's scary how out of control the housing market is.
New construction in Hamilton (Mercer). The homes sold for $900K months before they were completed.

Who can afford this?

A 700K loan is around $6,300/month/30 years. With property taxes that'll be $7,800/month.

We're in a bubble, a huge one.
I unfortunately knew exactly which house this was in montclair before I even looked it up :(
Housing as a market is very slow to come down, especially with limited supply being built because of shitty zoning laws. Anyone who wants cheaper homes should be lobbying their town to get rid of archaic and draconian zoning laws.
There was an open house near my house the other day and the amount of people that attended was insane.
It‚Äôs hot out of state too. I‚Äôm looking to get out of NJ in the next couple of years and prices are crazy at the moment. That said, I can sell my home here and get a nicer place where I‚Äôm looking (which, granted, is an out the way rural location) for half of what I‚Äôll make on the sale.
Wait till they see the property taxes.  Our town‚Äôs overall assessed value went up 20% in one year because they started using values of sold properties as assessed value.
It‚Äôs not just Montclair now. A standard 4 bedroom house, small yard, just average school districts are quickly approaching 1 million. 

NNJ market shows no sign of plateauing, short of a deep recession and even then some houses would still sell because of the amount of demand and wealth situated in the NY metro area.
All i need to know is what are these people doing for a living where they can afford an 800+k house?

I went to college, became a technical field making ""good"" money,wife has a full time job making similar pay too. And im frugal as hell and theres still no way i could afford that. Thank god i bought before this insainity.  So please tell me whats the secret so many people seem to know?
Not at all, a friend just sold her house for $250k over asking
This needs to end.  Home prices are just out of control.
I feel like this is actually a sign of the market going down. $1.17M for a nicely renovated 5BR in Montclair is a really good ‚Äúdeal‚Äù.
Gentrification of suburban nj
seller took a chance and listed it low to generate bidding war.  they have the right to refuse all offers if they didn't like any offers coming in.
If only we as a state weren‚Äôt deathly allergic to building more houses
And across the river its no different. Manhattan rents just set a new record, with median rent reaching $4500 a month.
Monmouth county here. We need to downsize and even with the work that needs to be done on my house, I don't think we will have issues selling. We are trying to decide do we reno the kitchen or not .
People with lots of money make a cash offer so they are able to swoop in and get it.
Seems like this was purposely listed lower at 895K to incite a bidding war. There's no realtor in their right mind that would actually think a 5 BR house in Montclair near downtown/train station would sell for that low.

Sadly, $1M is probably the baseline for houses like that permanently.
Down the block from us is a flood zone.

It doesn't flood always, but it can. It flooded out the basement at least 5 times since I moved into the neighborhood in 1997.

It was listed at 499,000.
It SOLD for 600,000

A cape cod in a FLOOD zone.
Make it make sense. 

It's fine by me because it helps property values, but I *truly* feel bad for first-time home buyers, I have no idea how they can do it.

We purchased our home in 1997 for 160,000, we could get over 600,000 easily now..it's crazy
Wow
This will be good news for my daughter. Their new home is almost done and will be listing their Morris Plains home in the next few weeks.
30 over. Nutty.
MLS shows it‚Äôs a 5 br in Montclair. Definitely looks like it was listed low.
Yes, it is Montclair! Beautiful interior house. Very well kept.  It is modern at the same time still has its historical taste/age to it.
wtf does a 4 bedroom $90K house even look like? Is it a house made for ants?
$900k in Hamilton? wtf, where?
The schools aren't even great in that part of town! But I guess if you can pay for a $900k house you can either afford a private school or decide not to have kids, etc
Everyone agrees we need more housing but people refer to the zoning laws when developers roll into town because they only want to build housing which leaves the schools overcrowded, the streets congested and infrastructure strained. 

Housing shortages is just one part of the problem.
Yeah but zoning law changes alone won‚Äôt change things like magic‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ only potentially add more higher density housing in specific areas that were perhaps commercial (and then likely be rental) and/or cause a handful of developers/flippers to turn a single family into a two family or something  along those lines. 


Additionally, zoning laws in general are a good thing. Let‚Äôs not be reductive.. despite the trend particularly in the contact of government/regulation. üòÖ
The condos their building in my town arent exactly making housing more affordable. All of them are going above half a million. Why someone would pay that much when a larger freestanding house with property and no HOA is less is way beyond me. 

Makes a lot of things more affordable for the developer/investors though. My opinion is all these housing developments are only benifting that one group of people while ruining otherwise nice small towns.
it‚Äôs fucking depressing‚Ä¶ even for us high earners originally from NJ and now trapped renting in NYC as we fucking try to get back and settle in a home in our 30s.

All of the New Yorkers flooding the state aren‚Äôt helping at all. Just look at the Long Island market.
Monmouth county 3 bedroom 1700 SF home sold for 950k, way over asking (799.9).
Montclair NJ isn't your average town. Think of Montclair as the NJ Manhattan. I think Aaron Rodgers calls Montclair home,

A lot of buyers get help from family whether it‚Äôs via their parents helping with the down payment, moving their parents in or inheritance.

Also Montclair and other suburbs with good commutes are extremely popular with the Wall Street crowd who have very deep pockets
‚ÄúGood‚Äù money is relative to where you live. If you have a household income of $250k then $800k is pretty doable.
Where? The where is a big part of it
When corporations keep buying up homes, and the cartel for 90% of the landlords Real Page would rather have a rental property/room empty at their minimum price of 3k, there are several younger generations that will never own a home unless they're pulling over 150k
Where in morris plains? Please pm me, I‚Äôm looking in a specific neighborhood.
5 bds, that‚Äôll do it.
That‚Äôs dirt cheap for a 5BR in Montclair!
Expect to pay 20-30% over ‚Äúasking‚Äù for Montclair homes listed under $1M. (‚ÄúAsking‚Äù is in quotes because they list low purposefully). That percentage goes down as the list price approaches $2M. We bid on multiple houses over 2 years in Montclair before landing a home and that was pre-Covid. There were some wild numbers out there when that happened.
South jersey is a strange place. I could see a house that needs a good bit of work, and in a less desirable area occasionally going for that little in 2019.
It was actually a nice property-half an acre. One car detached garage. 

The house was a foreclosure (we know the original owners)

All it needed was a good scrub down. Some new paint and a new roof and its a good looking house.

downstairs is pretty spacious and the upstairs is the master and jr master bedroom.

All the other homes in our development are smaller 2/3 bedroom one level homes and believe me some look like crack houses from Camden.
University heights
I wish mine or my wife's parents helped us out, had to do it all on our own.
Wyckoff
Yep, and this house is just a few blocks away from both the downtown and the train station
Yep! The first time you get the 'pretty woman' treatment is kind of humbling.  Adjust the list price down for homes you're viewing and bake in that 20-30 percent.
The only bit of work we had to do was replace the roof, which we got done free when we had solar panels placed.

The house itself just needed some hot soapy water and a good scrub.
I misread that sorry yea makes sense
Seems like a very low price for that location
We briefly looked at Montclair last year. All the realtors in that market underprice the list with an expectation that it will eventually sell for 20-35% more (and within a week). It's really frustrating but that is the strategy the market in that town has taken.

If you want to buy there you better have a good agent who knows that market well and a ton of cash available
It is a marketing strategy. Start low and create a bidding war which ultimately induces a higher final price.
I meant the sale price, not the original listing

Never saw one. But if they were flying over NWS Earle, Picattiney, and Linden Cogen plant with nav lights I wouldn‚Äôt be worried.
Military testing
Trump stopped them?
The previous administration said the exact same thing, but the trumpers (including Trump himself) wanted to believe it was secretly Iran‚Ä¶
#**THEY‚ÄôRETHESIZEOFSUVS!!!!!!!!**
That could not be more obviously a plane on descent.
despite the constant insistence on them, not one person ever put up a video of ""multiple drones"" and certainly no ""truck sized drones"". The ONLY videos the Cletuses put up- that were not shots of commercial aircraft in the traffic pattern,  were smartphone vids of INDIVIDUAL store bought drones flying in suburban back yards- EXACTLY as if the person posting them made them themselves.
Except they didn‚Äôt. They said they didn‚Äôt know.
Biden administration said:

‚ÄúHaving closely examined the technical data and tips from concerned citizens, we assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and stars mistakenly reported as drones. We have not identified anything anomalous and do not assess the activity to date to present a national security or public safety risk over the civilian airspace in New Jersey or other states in the northeast.‚Äù

Trump administration said:

‚ÄúAfter research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons. Many of these drones were also hobbyists, recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones. And in time, it got worse due to curiosity. This was not the enemy,‚Äù 

Seems like the same substance.
Read above ^. Keep in mind Biden was in office earlier in the investigation, so it would make sense for them to still not have a final conclusion. 

It‚Äôs funny how when Biden admin says it, trumpers say Iran and all kind of craziness, and Trump says they‚Äôre lying and know what it is and that he won‚Äôt stay in NJ JUST TO RILE UP VOTERS AND GAIN SUPPORT. 

Then as soon as he‚Äôs in office, they share exactly what the Biden admin said and suddenly it‚Äôs a sound answer that the trumpers are okay with. Insane!!! 

So many issue like this with the Trump campaign, and yet with all the info right in front of them, some people still choose to support him. Just nuts.
Thank you. 

If only they realized how easily they‚Äôre manipulated.
You‚Äôre being disingenuous. There were multiple statements from the Biden admin as well as our state government indicating they didn‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôm somehow ‚Äòmanipulated‚Äô by words I heard them say with my own ears. Ok pal.
No, I‚Äôm not being disingenuous LOL! 

They said they didn‚Äôt know when they first started the investigation because‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt know yet. 

They eventually (as clearly quoted above) said many many times that the drones were a combo of FAA approved drones and misidentifications‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs why I mentioned they started. By the time Trump came in, the investigation was nearly concluded.
Also, the number of sightings that turned out to be not drones (planes, helicopters, stars, etc) early on made it seem like there were things happening that they didn't know what they were. As those things were cleared away it became more clear that there was nothing unusual happening.
This is like having to explain 2+2 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
They probably just didn‚Äôt air them making the statement that the sighting appear to be FAA approved drones and misidentifications on Fox so I understand
>This is like having to explain 2+2

2+2 = several.

Try to register an utility trailer without vin number,"We bought a 16 feet utility trailer off Facebook market.

We‚Äôve been given one option: go apply for court case and ask judge to sign off obtaining ownership paper. It sounds like a painful long process.

Without a vin you can't follow the normal procedure for it which involves a title search. Even if you had one, the normal procedure is a pain in the ass and takes a while.

I'd move on. its a common problem with boat trailers in that range, where someone will finally decide to get rid of a trailer that has been in the back of their yard for 5 years, and all traces of paperwork\etc are gone. Since if they are under 2500 pounds, they are never really titled to begin with, and DMV relies on registration for owner history."
A Long Overdue Apology.,"Hello, this is going to sound a bit strange, but I owe an apology to a family I met on a train back in September 2016.

I was traveling from Princeton Junction to EWR, and I was having a pretty bad day (the reasons aren‚Äôt really important for this post). I was flying out of EWR and had a very large, bright 90 litre duffel bag with me. Unfortunately, there was nowhere on the train to properly store it. The duffel was too big for the aisles, and there weren‚Äôt any overhead racks‚Äîsomething I still don‚Äôt understand, since it is an airport train.

As the train started to fill up, a family boarded at another stop. A mother, father, and a child who looked to be no older than 10. There were two seats free, so the parents sat next to me, and the child took a seat further up the train. I felt horrible for taking up the seat with my bag, especially knowing it meant they had to split up, but I had no other place to put it, and I couldn‚Äôt leave it behind. I was also distracted by what had happened earlier that day, which made the situation worse.

When we arrived at EWR, I grabbed my bag and got ready to leave the train. As I was putting my duffel on my back, the father looked me in the eye and wished me a good trip. To this day, I‚Äôm not sure if he was being genuine or if there was some passive-aggressive tone to it.  It was only after passing through security I had an opportunity to reflect about what had happened and how much of an arse I had been. But I think about it every single time I fly.

This is a long shot, but to the family I met that day on the train: I am truly sorry for taking up the seat with my bag and unintentionally splitting up your family. I regret not apologizing to you at the time, and I‚Äôve thought about this moment every time I‚Äôve flown since 2016. In fact, I‚Äôm writing this post right now from a hotel in Vienna, just after flying in this morning.

Again, I‚Äôm sorry, and I hope you‚Äôve had safe and pleasant journeys since then.",0.77,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jbgq93/a_long_overdue_apology/,5,1jbgq93,2025-03-14 22:51,"Friend, the parents could have had one parent sit with their kid.

The trains don't really have space for suitcases and it's annoying. They're not ""airport trains"" per se, they're commuter trains that stop at the airport.¬†


As one who uses NJ Transit a lot, you didn't do anything wrong, and I'm sure the other family didn't really think about it.¬†


I don't know why they didn't have one parent sit with the kid and the other parent alone. (Or move to a different car where they may have been more seats).
For what it‚Äôs worth, it is obvious that you have emotional intelligence, something that our capitalistic society seems to be lacking these days.

Sorry forgot to clarify, I mean from one NJ county to another 
NJ county, not different states. Does that change anything?
No.  Once you move out of a jurisdiction you are no longer allowed to vote in that jurisdiction.  Doing so would be voter fraud.  There is no mechanism to issue a ballot that only has line items for Senator, Governor or President.
Thanks that makes sense, esp considering board of Ed elections are on the ballot, which would be inappropriate for a non resident to vote in."

THANK YOU NJ from a NJ to DC transplant. I‚Äôve been out of NJ for ten years now but I felt such pride today to be from NJ (and particularly not from New York, what the fuck guys). Schumer and gillibrand have to go. I actually went to the senate this morning with a group to explain the CR would destroy our public school system and defund services like our fire departments and water utility company. Gillibrand kicked us out. She was heard screaming at her colleagues yesterday. Schumer threw us under the bus because he‚Äôs a coward but he‚Äôs also kicking off a book tour he didn‚Äôt want delayed! It is very scary to be here right now, especially knowing the safety of our city is now wrapped up in a Susan Collins bill that‚Äôs going to be kicked back to the Republican house. We‚Äôre doing what we can down here to push back on the terrible ways this CR will impact the states. We APPRECIATE everyone in NJ who called, emailed, and pushed your senators to vote for democracy.

I was able to contact Kim and demand they do something about Chucky leading the party. The bending the knee to trump is embarrassing
Isn‚Äôt it obvious at this point they magically had just enough votes to pass. If they needed 3 it‚Äôd be 3, if they needed 10 well you know. 

Schumer doesn‚Äôt just go rogue as the leader, I‚Äôm confident most d senators wanted this, they just chose internally who could withstand the pressure and primary threat. 

No one is going to challenge Schumers leadership
I emailed them both before the vote
I thank them with my vote. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, they did their job. I‚Äôm not about to thank them for it. Now they can push for Schumer ouster.¬†
What‚Äôs the CR?
The fact that you think that Schumer and the exact # of votes needed to pass it crossed the line shows how little you know about politics.  I assure you Kim and Booker were both complicit.
I think every single call for every single issue has to remind them to object to unanimous consent as a way of slowing down the destruction.  We gotta bring it up during town halls because staffers may not be forwarding that part of the call

They so openly do not take us seriously.

People are calling with concerns about their LIVES. They really think we‚Äôre all NPCs.
Because Dems play by the rules, go high, blah blah. I see now that people were right when they said both parties are the same. Dems just want to sit back and let Trump happen. Well, they‚Äôre getting their wish. Fuckers.

I get what you're saying and don't deny that that's what happened, but didn't they need 8 democrat votes and they got 10?
Exactly, I was going to say the same thing. It was all staged. They decided behind closed doors who would vote no. Like Mitch McConnell voting against those nominees, which he never would have done if the outcome was in doubt.¬† People are so naive.¬†
I can see how with current events you would think that, but in this case it's not so much about showing gratitude or bending the knee, but about giving them feedback so they know they made the right decision. So that next time they don't think, ""Well, no one cared last time so this time I'll vote differently."" Calling and letting them know how you feel, approval or disapproval, is how you keep your representatives in line. Republicans do the same thing in reverse, so it's important to counteract that. Might be helpful to find a copy of the Indivisible playbook and take a look.
He should really be careful with his phrasing
can u post a source to the 1700 calls per minute figure
If not just Dems in DC.   Democrats in Trenton refused to vote for abortion rights to be put into our state constitution because it's an issue they want to run on.  They're not codifying the immigrant protections against ICE into law because they want to run on that issue.  


They want to use issues that are important to us to boost their campaigns, so instead of moving forward and focusing on new goals, like maybe universal basic income, we're left worrying about things they still haven't addressed

Q: Best Boardwalk Beach for 70's parents mini-vac in June,"I have a quick question - My parents are from upstate NY and have a bucket list of a few things they want to visit before they cant anymore.

They are now in their 70's and both have some minor mobility and health issues, so wanted to go somewhere driveable to a beach/boardwalk for a 3-day mini vacation this June. My dad will not fly anymore, so ...

My mom asked me to help her find which NJ Boardwalk beach would be a good choice for them.

They are looking for a typical boardwalk (helps if its not super crowded, definitely not spring break party style) with lots of shops, food, and stuff to look at. They cannot partake of amusement parks and stuff anymore, and their beach time would probably be limited to walking on it and maybe sitting on a bench etc. and just enjoying the view and stuff. 

Someplace with some good sit-down food/restaurant choices, and importantly a decent hotel (not the Ritz - but good 3-4 star chain hotel or local equivalent). They don't want to deal with AirBnB stuff, too old to figure that out. Traditional hotel, ideally easy access to the boardwalk and central to the stuff to do.

They do like to gamble, so a casino nearby would not hurt, but they can do that here - or make a casino visit another stop on their trip, so the beach/town/boardwalk/hotel is more important. 

Any suggestions?

My folks are in their 80s and do a week at the Montrealer every summer. The town is very walkable and has a lot of shopping and dining options. 

It‚Äôs close enough to AC for a side quest.
My immediate thought is Asbury because there's a lot of shops in convention hall and a smallish boardwalk without a bunch of party people like seaside. Def no casino though, but plenty of restaurants off the boardwalk on and around cookman. Plenty of parking usually.
Ocean Grove. We lived there and walked to Asbury to avoid the noise and crowds. Cute Main Ave too. It's a dry town but you can BYOB to restaurants and of course at the house.
Disadvantage of Asbury is the hotels, of which there are few. Older folks are not going to like the vibe of the Empress (thumping disco music downstairs) and all three are insanely expensive in season.
Came here to say this.  It's really the best boardwalk.
Ocean Grove is such an odd little throwback town...it's cool to walk around and check out the commune tents

Yeah this is a bit confusing, where exactly are they supposed to be protesting? The grass strip in front of the dealership is most likely private property, as well as the surrounding lots.

I'm just the messenger. I'm going to assume the organizers know what they are doing.

People are against this because the only people it disrupts is the average person like you and me trying to make a living that works there. Elon is not sweating a protest in Springfield NJ.
Yea, the way every post about every kind of protest is making me think some of them have to be bots. Who else would be hanging out in the NJ sub just to wait for someone to mention a protest and then immediately comment with non-specific reasons that it‚Äôs a bad idea. 

That being said, I definitely understand the safety concerns for this particular protest and how that could lead to an early end. Either way, visibility is the main goal here and that can be achieved regardless.

Elon Musk doubles down on endorsement of far-right German party in conversation on X.

Also, not for nothing, but the people who rely on all the programs that Musk is cutting also have nothing to do with him.
Guess they'll have to use those bootstraps
Are you serious? Lmao. 

Tesla doesn't work on commissions for one. 

Two, car salesmen that do work on commissions are literally some of the most soulless humans on earth. Their entire job is literally trying to scam you 15 different times into signing on a dotted line before you realize how bad of a deal they're giving you.

Three, Tesla owns every single dealership outright. Unlike every other manufacturer in the country. Which conveniently makes their dealerships and AMAZING target for peaceful protests. 

The less and less Tesla's sold, the closer and closer Elon gets to having a full blown mental breakdown. A day that can't come soon enough.
as someone who just bought a car outright but works from home in sweatpants, a lot of car salesman are kinda judgemental assholes...bunch of these dealerships on 22 pull bullshit and give preferential treatment based on appearance...so, they'll be ok if someone protests their dear leader for a day or two
Won't someone think of the poor car salesmen!
this country was literally founded on protesting
\>So it's a local business

Tesla dealerships are not franchised and are owned by multinational corporation. If this is a ""local business"" to you then your definitions of local are extremely skewed.

\>the owner may be liberal

The ""owner"" is elon musk, who is absolutely not a liberal. Again, these stores are owned by a corporation, of which elon musk (not a liberal) is the head.

\>You want to disrupt his business because you don't like Elon and Trump?

My man, this is the entire point of protests. If everyone had that mentality, the tea never would have been thrown into boston harbor 250 years ago and we would still be paying taxes to people halfway around the country. 

You're simping for the richest man in the world, btw
>So it's a local business and the owner may be liberal.¬†

Well, then they'll welcome us protesting their absentee CEO
Wow, what a runaway string of ridiculous strawman arguments.


Kids, look right here for an example of logical fallacies.
Yes.

Protests are not convenient

Bold assumption for people that have buying better to do on a Saturday
If the president is calling protesting it an act of terrorism and trying to help Elon sling cars on federal dime then I'd say he is sweating it. Keep it up.
Exactly.

Not to mention the chaos at other tesla  ""protests"" right now. No one knows what a protest will even turn into anymore. Bashing PRIVATE citizens cars across the country is insane. Wrecking other ppls stuff, that they worked hard for is not helping the cause. I see ppl saying  ""insurance will pay for damage, whatever."" Besides the initial deductible that is usually $500 - $1000 that THEY have to pay. Any  time u make a claim, your insurance GOES UP dramatically. I made a claim 8 years ago. 1 claim my entire life. My insurance  DOUBLED...and still has not gone down to what it should be.  Starting fires, throwing handmade bombs, it just makes them look unhinged. 

I grew up going to protests across NJ, NYC and DC for animal rights, anti vivisection, clean water, SW rights, ect.  We didnt fk up ppls stuff. We organized, walked door to door to get signatures and donations. Went to town/city  meetings, spoke to our lawmakers. Gathered together at govt buildings to negotiate. Nowadays, shouting, destruction & violence has become WAY too popular as a go to.
Tesla showroom staff do not work on commission and won't be affected by this. If they have to close up shop for any reason, maybe they don't get paid. But if closing up shop means employees don't get paid, maybe that is a problem with the business owner's ideas of fair compensation and not the people who are protesting.
France‚Ä¶ there the protests end with fire.
U say this like it hasn't been happening though. It HAS been happening. Numerous places across the U.S. I am ALL FOR ppl protesting -  it is a constitutional right. But ppl show up nowadays, not knowing what a protest is going to turn into.
It‚Äôs a bot account.
My elderly mom is picking up her car which was serviced. Please don't harass her.
Actual brainrot take
As a firefighter I'm going to give you the jersey bird. We are not allowed to just let a building burn down no matter  which asshole lives there. And besides the fact fires like to spread.
How could you be this stupid
Exactly.

Arguing in this way doesn't help anything.  Protests are meant to be inconvenient for all, not just the people who are doing the thing people are protesting.
That‚Äôs true
Tesla dealerships don‚Äôt have salesmen, all sales are done online.
[removed]
I assure you that protesting at a Tesla dealership is not going to change one single thing.
You‚Äôre probably right. But my main sentiment was as a former retail employee, this would annoy the fuck out of me if im trying to get thru the day. And if the place closes and it turns out these people are hourly workers and lose out on pay thats a problem. Idk what the solution is to let people protest whatever they please. Im just speaking as someone whos worked at retail locations that this is one of the last things someone wants to see. And as we know its not exactly easy finding a new job God forbid the establishment closes down.
Glad you said this. Felt like i was getting downvoted for having a nuanced approach and reasonable disagreement with the protests. Im prepared for more downvotes but I am a tesla owner. Do i like elon? Not really. Do I love my car? Fuck yeah. It was my first car and Im paying for it myself. If someone fucked with my car, 1 sentry mode is almost always on, im tracking you down and reporting you, 2 I already bought the car, Elon already has the money, its my car not his anymore.
Yes agree, even if they dont make commission, they could be hourly workers, if the shop closes for a day theyll lose out. But idk if theyre salary or hourly.
Right, all it takes is one idiot to do something stupid and give others the courage to join in. It's unfortunate, but sometimes 'peaceful' protests go sideways.

What was wrong with it?
Thankfully people don't live in Tesla dealerships.
didn't look at Teslas, but two Toyota dealerships on 22 kinda suck, and one on 46 also kinda sucked...in the last few weeks I was at about 10 different dealerships and a lot of them just felt scummy
That's like your opinion, man.
If you‚Äôre worried about people losing their jobs, wait til you hear what Elon‚Äôs been up to the last two months.
I get it but I think we'll all have to get used to being uncomfortable if we want to make enough noise. It's unfortunate that the CEO of their company has made some tumultuous decisions over the last year that has trickled down to their business location but that's something Musk should have thought of. I'm sure his shareholders aren't happy either.
This is the problem with Reddit right now, or just an unfortunately large group of people in general. They can't make that disconnect between people like you, and a man they dislike. To them, because you own this car, you support the man. They feel that you deserve to have your shit fucked up, that if you truly cared you'd take the loss, and give up your hard earned property to make them happy.

Anyone that downvotes someone for liking their hard earned car, or opposing the vandalism of private citizens' property because of one douchebag they have nothing to do with just, isn't living in the real world.

I'm all for protesting a company, but don't fuck other people's shit up. Its hard enough to buy groceries, and keep the house warm, most people just can't afford to get rid of a car and get a new one.
If the shop closes because of the protests, then elon musk should pay them out a day's wages. He has the money for it. Of course, he would never do that, he would just blame the protestors and stiff the workers that way the working class continues to fight amongst themselves.
For this to succeed, it needs to be rational. They said it's an elderly mother getting a car *serviced*, which means it was very likely purchased before there was any Nazi behavior or disturbing Hitler/Nazi reposts. Just be aware that not everyone can sell their car on a whim and they can still agree with your sentiment. I say this as someone who would like nothing more than Tesla to catagorically denounce Nazi ideaology and require any executives or board members who want to pursue politics to give up their position at the company.
This guy likes to act tough by bullying peoples grandmothers? NJ sure has changed
Imagine being this clown ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
Are you going to help cover the depreciation and cost of a new car for her? I buy my cars to drive them to the ground not everyone can suddenly go out and buy a car.
She kept hearing this noise that sounded like Nazi propaganda
No that‚Äôs a fact.
Enlighten me how holding up signs in protest outside the business of a South African fascist is ""bullying people's grandmother's""?
I think it kept turning to the Reich and will never go left.
Yea sure 1 protest does nothing. Hell 100 is a minor blip. But it all adds up, and frankly it's only been getting bigger and bigger.

So kindly stuff that fact back in your mouth.
My grandma is picking up her car please don‚Äôt harass her

Tell her to suck it up

How are you supporting that guy

Also do you want me to hate him because he‚Äôs African? Why point out where he‚Äôs from I thought that was racist. Stop arguing in bad faith
Fascist?. Lololo
Sure thing, keep wasting your time. I didn‚Äôt vote for the orange clown nor his autistic puppet but I can still see how dumb these protests are. Employees at a Tesla shop have nothing to do with policy and I assure you Elon doesn‚Äôt care about any of this.
Tell me you don't know what fascism is without telling me you don't know what fascism is...
Tell me you dont think for yourself with out telling me you dont think for yourself.
Do you even know what the 5 major tenants of fascism are? 

The first is claiming that you are above the law while casting doubt on the pillars of democracy for not favoring you. Like how Trump claimed up and down that the 2020 election was stolen. Or how he constantly claims that he and he alone is the one who can save America. 

The second is attacking women's rights and sexual orientation. Like the constant attacks against the LGBTQ community, abortion rights etc. 

The third is a nationalist rhetoric based on race and/or religion. Like how Trump has continually attacked Muslims, Mexicans and immigrants on the whole as the source for all of America's problems. 

Fourth is denouncing and destroying educational systems and trying to erase history. Like how Trump just announced the immediate dissolving and defunding of federal museums and libraries. Or like how he's trying to dismantle the DoE. 

The fifth is destroying every facet of checks and balances within the government and replacing them all with loyalists so you don't have to answer to the laws. Like how Trump is directing the AG to investigate Dems, without even alleging crimes. Or how he's dissolving every agency that is in charge of protecting citizens and workers on the basis of ""getting rid of government waste and abuse"". 

I think for myself just plenty, hence why I can actually identify fascism when I see it. Hence why I can identify that Trump is the biggest conman in the history of American politics. It's always the ones who don't actually think for themselves, who love to tell everyone they don't think for themselves. Classic conservative projection."

Sad experience in Supercuts exposing our country's racism," Went to get a haircut this morning at Supercuts in *North Jersey (because I'm a high roller like thatüòá). Walked in and there were 2 elderly Spanish ladies working there & I was the only customer, so she took me right away. 

For context Im a 50 yr old very white dude. Anyway, throughout the haircut the ladies were chatting back-and-forth mostly in Spanish about whatever.  My Spanish is admittedly pretty rudimentary but at one point, one of the ladies said, ""we shouldn't be talking only in Spanish in front of him"". Then the other lady said in English to me, ""sorry we're speaking Spanish to each other"" & it broke my heart.

I said I don't mind whatsoever and I envy that you can speak both languages so fluently as you must be very bright to do that. I also said you should never be ashamed to speak your native tongue, no matter what our current political climate is like in this country and they just smiled meekly.

  I could tell both ladies were very uncomfortable because they didn't know me from Adam, but they're obviously feeling the pressure of being an immigrant in a hostile country. 

How truly sad our country has become where two co-workers can't converse in their native tongue without fear of some racist calling ICE on them or whatnot.....BTW, got a great haircut!!",0.43,https://reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jbb5pz/sad_experience_in_supercuts_exposing_our_countrys/,36,1jbb5pz,2025-03-14 18:50,"I think the only thing you‚Äôre lying about here is that you had a great haircut at Supercuts.
My god the self aggrandizing here is approaching LinkedIn levels
Maybe they just think it‚Äôs rude to carry on in another language in front of a customer? Stop trying to preempt people‚Äôs thoughts and just interact with others like they‚Äôre normal human beings. They were probably uncomfortable because you incorrectly assumed they‚Äôre scared of being deported or harassed because they‚Äôre Hispanic.

Then everybody clapped
A small gesture of repair in our damaged country. It's OK to reflect on it here. Just ignore the negative comments.
The fact that OP felt anything other than extreme embarrassment when writing this is why the Democrat party has to be destroyed before it can hope to be a capable opposition. While our society is stripped for parts by the GOP, liberals like this think they are demonstrating some kind of praxis, moving themselves to tears, for simply being in the general vicinity of a brown person that they are openly assuming is destitute to the point of imminent arrest. 

We've got to start over, a clean slate. These brains are completely broken by white savior nonsense.
Take the identifying info out of this post so trolls can't make a false ICE report against them
Weird post.
I think this more when you talk in a language with someone else in the middle who can‚Äôt understand it can make you feel like they are talking about you or saying something they don‚Äôt want you to hear. I think that‚Äôs what they likely were afraid of. 

If they have concerns about the crazy immigration enforcement currently I‚Äôm sure they know people probably assume they are Hispanic without speaking Spanish.
I dont see anything sad about it .¬† Seems like 2 really nice women who cared about your feelings. No reason to get weird and political about it¬†
Get over it and find a another hair cutter.
I don't know if you took it too far with your post but I find it intriguing that you connect the dots from them speaking Spanish which in times is their native language as to hiding it because of the current politicals government despite the misguided facts of illegal immigration and removing them from the country. If they follow the book got a green card did everything they're supposed to then there's nothing to fear what is going on is removal of those who did come in this country illegally, did not go out and seek help for asylum, have also committed crimes in this country that are not citizens.
ü§£ü§£ü§£
Plus I thought everyone knows it‚Äôs rude to speak another language in front of someone who can‚Äôt speak it because they feel left out.
Don't be like this, speculation like this does nothing but spread hate.
How many more millions to fix?.
Well this post is about native language
Good idea!
I think OP should actually learn to speak Spanish, and then go in for another haircut once he's fluent and *apologize* to them for being white.
> If they follow the book got a green card did everything they're supposed to then there's nothing to fear what is going on is removal of those who did come in this country illegally, did not go out and seek help for asylum, have also committed crimes in this country that are not citizens.

This just atraight up isnt accurate. Over the past several weeks there have been a number of high profile arrests and detentions of individuals who are here legally, including actual US citizens born amd raised, who have committed no crime but have been detained by ICE for one reason or another. Varipus European nations have issued travel advisories to their citizens cautioning them not to come here even as tourists because of the number of issues and incidents.
Right or it makes it seem like you‚Äôre talking about them
[deleted]
I'll start by saying that I have no idea either, but what do *you* think ""2 elderly Spanish ladies"" means?
Share the info
Post up some documentation of these ‚Äúhigh profile‚Äù arrests of citizens by ICE.
For real, may as well be whispering in each other's ear and casting sideways glances at OP.

I'm a white dude, used to get skin fades in my 20s, so *obviously* I went to a Spanish barber.  They could not give a fuck who was in the chair.  I had dudes who would have cell phones tucked into a headband so they could talk ""hands free,"" and when they weren't on the phone they were chatting with the next barber.  None of this mattered to me, I was just there to get my hair cut.
You're not wrong about how the OP is acting but you're no better. Unless these ladies obviously tell how they voted you can't be sure. You're doing the exact opposite of what OP is doing.

The hate you're spreading is based on an assumption that these ladies voted for Trump because some Hispanic women voted for Trump, when depending on your sources 60% of Hispanic women voted for Harris while 38% voted for Trump.
Completely. In fact, I'd say that casting any group of people as beautiful, infallible totems of tolerance is probably much more damaging in terms of tokenization.
That they were elderly and Hispanic. Barbers, as well. That's about as much as I gathered
