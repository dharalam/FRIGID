This, and Steve's outward attacks against the NJ political machine show me that he has good political instincts and is offering the transformative change this state desperately needs. \n\nHowever, I've also grown very fond of Ras Baraka and his very belligerent approach to the Trump administration. Whether it is directly decrying the ICE raids in his city or seeking to prevent the ICE detention facility from re-opening in Newark, his fiery rhetoric and commitment towards the Democratic platform at a time when federal-level Democrats have been meek and cowardly in the face of Trump really resonates with me. He's energized me listening to his speeches and seeing the actions he's taken as of late.\n\n  \nI suppose this is a good problem to have as I like both these candidates, but I'm still torn on who I should ultimately vote for in the primary.

I see a lot of posts across Reddit about anti ICE/pro-DACA protests. That's great and all, but as someone who is more familiar with immigration laws, the chance is that none of these will actually help us or them. Also, *ICE has no realistic manpower to actually deport all the illegal immigrants.* DHS and USCIS data shows that the removal number in January 2025 is *lower* than that of Biden or Obama administration. Calling state reps or senates don't do anything.\n\nBut there are issues that you may actually influence.\n\nAs a scientist in the industry, my colleagues and I *heavily rely on* academia. I m sure folks like me know already but industry research is mostly for profits, while academic research is for knowledge. We cannot exist without the each other. Forget about the \"BIG PHARMA\" or \"EVIL CHEMICAL\" for a second. The current administration, mostly by DOGE, is single handedly attempting, and more effectively than the last term. damaging very important government agencies: NIH, NSF, FDA, NASA.\n\nNIH is the core public health and medical research agency with its origin from **1887**, and it is a huge agency that deals with every aspect of government research: funding, travel, conference, regulation, grant review, everything you can imagine. For reasons that we still don't know (well we do know, it's part of Project 2025 to dismantle federal government, but it doesn't benefit Americans regardless where you come from), NIH has been the first target of DOGE and **they froze grants, loans, communications, all suspensions of meetings and conferences, travels, meaning that all staff members are essentially forced to half their work entirely. Hiring freezing and communication freezing isn't abnormal, but a total halting of the financial aspects is extreme if not completely unheard of.  They are also threatening to mass-lay off the NIH workers (https://www.eenews.net/articles/science-funding-agency-threatened-with-mass-layoffs/)**\n\nSimilar thing is happening to NSF, National Science Foundation. **In fact, they have recently release a list of words that will cause a grant revoke (see here** https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1ih8kp3/list\\_of\\_banned\\_words\\_being\\_sent\\_to\\_nsf\\_pos/). The majority the words are very common apolitical descriptions that the administration deems to \"woke\" for them.

Despite what culture war vultures try to tell you, NIH and NSF are extremely important bastion of knowledge and research that contributed to the US' scientific prowess. In fact, NIH GENERATERS **2.47$ per 1$ SPENT!** So the typical \"money bleeding argument' doesn't even fit here. FDA deregulation will further potentially endanger the consumers even more by allowing unscrupulous companies to declare untested, unverified claims to swindle everyone.\n\nIf I *sound* alarmist, that's cool.

According to New Jersey\u2019s Department of Law and Public Safety: \u201cIn November 2018, the Attorney General issued the \u201cImmigrant Trust Directive,\u201d a landmark document designed to strengthen trust between law enforcement and the state's diverse immigrant communities. The Directive limits the types of voluntary assistance that New Jersey\u2019s state and local law enforcement officers may provide to federal immigration authorities, including ICE, and emphasizes that New Jersey state, county, and local authorities are responsible for enforcement of criminal law, not federal civil immigration law. In doing so, the Directive makes clear that victims and witnesses can report crimes to law enforcement without fear that they will be turned over to federal immigration authorities.\u201d\u00a0\n   * Read More: [Immigrants' Rights in NJ](https://www.njoag.gov/programs/immigrants-rights/#:~:text=Ensuring%20immigrants%20feel%20safe%20interacting%20with%20local%20police.&text=In%20doing%20so%2C%20the%20Directive,over%20to%20federal%20immigration%20authorities.)\n* Mexican Citizens have the backing of the Mexican Consulate in Philadelphia 100%\n   * **Consulate of Mexico Phone:** [(215) 923-8384](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tZP1zcsSa6IL640MWC0UjWosLBMNku2sDAxT0u2MEozsbQyqEgzMUlJNUkzMk-xMEw0MknzkstNrchMTsxTSM7PKy7NSSxJVSjIyMxJTEnNAdKJAC7lGxY&q=mexican+consulate+philadelphia&rlz=1C1SQJL_enUS884US884&oq=Mexican+Consulate&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqEAgBEC4YrwEYxwEYgAQYjgUyDQgAEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyEAgBEC4YrwEYxwEYgAQYjgUyDQgCEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyEwgEEC4YgwEYrwEYxwEYsQMYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyDQgHEC4YrwEYxwEYgAQyEwgIEC4YgwEYrwEYxwEYsQMYgAQyDQgJEC4YrwEYxwEYgATSAQg2NDQzajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#)\n* Get Papers in Order\n   * ID\u2019s\u2026If you do not have an ID and are able to obtain one, *GET ONE.* Part of the problem is this: US Citizens are having their citizenship questioned based on their cultural background, appearance, and language.

Attend and assist in disseminating accurate information about knowing your rights.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\\*\\*On Law Enforcement and New Jersey\u2019s Immigrant Trust Directive (ITD)\\*\\*\n\n\n\nBecause of NJ\u2019s Immigrant Trust Directive, (\u201cITD\u201d) it is less likely that local law enforcement will accompany ICE on raids. In 2018, the AG issued the ITD to strengthen trust between law enforcement and NJ\u2019s diverse immigrant communities. The Directive is designed to ensure that, regardless of their immigration status, victims and witnesses feel safe reporting crimes to the local police. It therefore limits state and local cooperation with ICE.\n\n  \n\n\nOne of the key asks from the immigrant advocacy community is this: DO NOT speculate about ICE. Spreading roomers is damaging the response to organize. Also, Advocates want immigrants to still report crimes. Fear is the biggest hindrance. This is understandable, but we do not want to cause excessive rumors as they are ultimately draining on resources and efforts.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAction Steps: \n\n1. Write your state representatives to support the asks of the immigrant community here in New Jersey, as well as your federal officials.\u00a0\n\n2. Pray without ceasing.

I have experienced first hand the difficulties undocumented immigrants face everyday and the negative political discourse the nation has about us lately. I don't endorse criminal activity of any type. For some reason Americans think undocumented people represent a considerable percentage of felonies across the country when, in reality, it's the opposite. Verify\u00a0[here](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate).\n\nI don't like to get into political stuff, but we all know the new administration represents questionable values regarding our community. Don't let this rhetoric diminish your value. Media and ignorant people will polarize our role in society, making you think \"you're not enough for the American nation\". Aside from employers exploiting workers with minimum wages for hard labor, they see no other contribution of the undocumented community in society.\n\nI acknowledge not everyone thinks this way. In fact, a small percentage of Americans do, but they are noisy and hateful. We know our situation and do our best to contribute, we have ITIN numbers to report our taxes, drive vehicles with lawfully issued licenses, create businesses with EIN and compliance paperwork, speak English fluently and don't abuse state and federal programs like food stamps (I hope you're not abusing it, don't be part of the problem).\n\nThe majority of us didn't choose to be in this position. ICE targeting workplaces, churches, and schools is a poor execution of wiping out undocumented criminals, they just simply don't hang out there. We have to be cautious, know your rights clearly and exercise Miranda rights when necessary. Read and carry a copy of the constitution. You're living in the US regardless of status, so you should make an effort to understand the system and law, no exceptions.

As anything in life, knowledge and a solid mindset is necessary for success. Be mindful of your actions and stay away from law enforcement (in the positive and protection sense). We need accurate and reliable information, and for most cases executive orders can be exercised only on the scope of the current law and require a rigorous process to modify the constitution. In an unbiased manner, question everything this or other administrations propose regarding policy of any type just like the ridiculous, racist and unproductive allocation of mental energy of the birthright citizenship executive order.

I\u2019ll answer your comments, but first, let me clarify: I wrote this in reaction to the latest news and events surrounding this topic, so it has an emotional aspect, though I did my best to bring objectivity.\n\nOne additional point I didn\u2019t discuss is that undocumented immigrants are unfortunately negatively impacted by the actions of gangs and terrorist groups within the country. We want those groups out as much as you do. This isn\u2019t an easy task to accomplish, as there are many collateral effects that impact the immigrant community. The real problem has historic roots, such as the stigmatization of Italian and Chinese immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries due to mafia and illegal activity. A small subgroup of immigrants acting unlawfully creates the perception that this is what to expect from the entire group.\n\nA contemporary example could be MS-13 or the current Train Aragua national threats (they must be wiped out asap). This issue has been weaponized by multiple political administrations throughout history, abusing the uninformed average American to gain votes.\n\nI\u2019m against illegal immigration, but I sympathize with those who hold the right values, manage to cross the border, and strive to contribute to society within their limited legal scope. This topic is complex, and to avoid the abuse of the border, immigration systems should be properly established.\n\nI just think the conversation can quickly turn irrational when political ideologies obstruct objective points, and emotional reactions steer the discourse away from the core issue. ", "I know there's a whirlwind of panic surrounding the ICE raids, and with good reason. But I want to talk about a threat that's just as deadly- bird flu.\n\nTrump has ended the ability of relevant health agencies from communicating their research with the public, or even from engaging in that research in the first place. Let us be clear: we are not being left to die, they are trying to kill us from a distance. But New Jerseyans are tough gristly bastards. If we need to protect ourselves, we will.\n\nWhat are state-level resources people know of, that track bird flu? What agencies are doing research and sampling? How can we harden our communities against this next looming pandemic?", "Mods - can we please get a sticky going of where ICE raids have taken place to document these actions? We need a way to document where these have taken place. ", "I know a post about the one in Newark got a lot of attention, but I heard there were also raids in Vineland and East Brunswick.

Don't do anything illegal or that will get you hurt, but waste their time if you can. \n\nRemember: Immigrant or not: YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEAK WITH THEM. Don't speak without a lawyer present. Don't answer questions. Demand and verify real warrants because they do try to trick people with ICE warrants that are not valid. Don't let them into your home or place of business. \n\nThere are ICE agents that have and will pose as police officers, pretend to be part of specific precincts, etc. Approach EVERYTHING with caution. \n\nAnd just please be kind to one another right now.\n\nEdit from anyjane21: Judicial warrants will be signed by a judge and says United States District Court at the top. \nWhen reviewing warrants-details matter, pay attention to the date, time, and place the warrant specifies. \n\nThe National Immigrant Legal Center has information  on determining the differences between judicial and administrative warrants. https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Warrants-Subpoenas-Facts.pdf\n\nEdit from feelitrealgood: A handy guide to help prepare workplaces \n\nhttps://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/EmployerGuide-NELP-NILC-2017-07-1.pdf\n\n\nEdit 3: I am not arguing with you blockheads!!
