Hundreds Protest Against Reopening ICE Detention Facility In Newark	""	0.87	https://reddit.com/r/Newark/comments/1j9tfjd/hundreds_protest_against_reopening_ice_detention/	48	1j9tfjd	2025-03-12 20:04	"15 year contract, is all about the money and not a real effort to end illegal immigration.

Barrack Obama deported 3 million people.
Oh look Mexican flags !
Every illegal alien should be deported. I still don’t understand why these illegals should be prioritized over everyone who’s eligible for their hardship and waiting for their turn for years to enter legally. Send them back.
How cute, will change nothing. Enforce the law
They should open TWO.
Illegal= illegal send them back to the 3rd world
They came
From
Quick someone get Obama on the phone and let him know the detention center he opened up during his first administration is back in action🤣🤣🤣🤣. 

Liberals have the memory of goldfish; easily duped in to mindless protests. 

Like all liberal outrage; this will go nowhere.


Some people do need to be deported. People convicted of crimes. A facility here is not the frontline of ideological morality. 

People should definitely be protesting in support of Mahmoud Khalil, and for 100 other terrible things Trump is doing, but this hill is the same old hollow nonsense.
Hundreds, such a small turn out.
True Biden made it worse . Democrate
Lies lies lies. Democrats are gonna be broke here before too long. They’re gonna run out of money paying all these people to protest over nothing.
Paid protestors.  

I mean, what are they protesting there?  That place is in the middle of nowhere where.  Industrial wasteland.

It’s basically just a paid event for some media coverage.  

The reality is that most people just don’t care either way.  Whatever… - Let’s go back to the sangria post
But never fixed the root causes or strengthened the southern border
>waiting for their turn for years to enter legally

You realize that the people who entered the system legally, claiming asylum, and are awaiting their immigration hearings before a judge, are also being rounded up and deported? And not like 1 or 2 here or there.....

We also have green card holders being illegally detained, stripped of due process, and attempted to be deported for first amendment protected activities 

You also realize that, as under trump 1.0, there will be virtually no advancement of any applications for entry to the US, be it visas, naturalization, etc. they plan to just obstruct and delay all those processes, as they did first go around. 

You still really believe this is about legal vs illegal? Lol
This facility was protested when Obama opened it too, and liberals very much aware of Obama’s failure to measure up as a truly progressive President. You think this is such a gotcha when in reality he fell out of favor heavily and is currently regarded by real leftists as a former president who isn’t living up to his own stated principles, becoming a media mogul instead of doing more to further causes that matter in his retirement.
1. Obama did get protested for his policies on immigration. I was personally one of the people protesting him. I was there!

2. I am glad that more liberals are protesting now than they did during Obama. If people are finally realizing how cruel immigrant detention centers are, then I am glad they are waking up. This isn't a gotcha. It's a good thing when people can change their minds. Who cares where they were during Obama if they are in the right place now?
The problem is that the vast majority of people Trump is going to send to this detention center are not violent criminals. They are hardworking people just trying to live their lives. And if you think green card holders and naturalized citizens aren't at risk, I have some Hawk Tuah cryptocurrency to sell you.
Would it be too harsh to tell you to get fucked? 

Boycott all fascist propaganda!
Who do you think is paying the protesters?
>> You realize that the people who entered the system legally, claiming asylum, and are awaiting their immigration hearings before a judge, are also being rounded up and deported? And not like 1 or 2 here or there.....

10+mm illegal aliens have been allowed into this country and were given legal status with no proper documentation. So you think this was completely acceptable? 

>> We also have green card holders being illegally detained, stripped of due process, and attempted to be deported for first amendment protected activities

“We are westerners fighting for the total eradication of the Western civilization... We seek community and instruction from militants in the Global South”. So you think this guy should not be deported? 

>>You also realize that, as under trump 1.0, there will be virtually no advancement of any applications for entry to the US, be it visas, naturalization, etc. they plan to just obstruct and delay all those processes, as they did first go around.

What exactly will the country be losing if there is “no advancement of any applications for entry to the US”?

People like you is the reason the country is being abused so much and democrats coming to power.
It’s funny how the same progressives who want to police language typically have no idea what words mean. Obama got protested for his stand on immigration? does protest mean what I think it does? Liberals/ progressives voted at a 90% clip for saint O if I recall; twice !!

Progressives have soured on the great one? Did anyone tell Kamala and the democrat party? Hasn’t been six months since Obama got rolled out to shore up Kamala’s campaign. Why put him out there if he is so unpopular? 

You may have the memory and attention span of a goldfish but I don’t. Obama ran on a tough on immigration platform. Shutting down the border, restrictive path to citizenship, mandatory English proficiency. Pretty much everything Trump ran on. Progressives lapped it up. Go look ok YouTube ; plenty of receipts. 

Democrats are not the party of the working class or good governance. It’s now the party of identity politics, blood thirsty war mongers, child killing ghouls and corporatist shills. Every accusation is an admission. Every policy, a reversal. 

The cosplay isn’t working; no one buys the bull shit but at least these clown antics provide for good entertainment🤣.
The level of ignorance and fear mongering in your post is astounding. It’s one thing to disagree on immigration policy but at least have the common decency to make a good faith argument for your position instead of spreading lies. 

Except for illegals who are subject to expedited removal; all individuals suspected of having committed immigration violations can only be removed subject to a court order. 

Expedited removal does not apply to those who have been paroled ie: registered on the CBP 1 app. 

This is however not inclusive of those who have already been convicted of felonies. Felons who are not citizens are subject to immediate removal from the United States . 

 Anyone with an internet connection and 8th grade reading comprehension can look these things up on the internet. 

It’s precisely because the deportation hearings take so long that law enforcement intentionally target those with existing felonies.  In many cases, these felons have committed more than one felony. Typically it’s violation of an existing removal order in combination with other serious crimes. 

A US citizen cannot by definition be deported. Where will the govt. send a citizen? 

A green card like other visa types allow residence subject to conditions. If you have a green card and have not been convicted of a felony; there is no legal basis to deport you. 

It’s funny how liberals claim to love democracy so much but insists that the will of the people be denied either through law fare or political violence. Trump ran on a clear immigration platform that includes closing the border and deporting illegals and won handily. Were you asleep the last 4 years? The American people don’t want their country to be flooded with illegals. How difficult is that for liberals to understand? 

No one ever accused a liberal of having principles. 🤦🏾

PS> for what it is worth; I am not a fan of expedited removal. The law is broadly written and allows for broad interpretation and arbitrariness that, in my personal view is constitutionally questionable.
It doesn't matter though. If you're here illegally, you shouldn't be here. Countries like Canada and Europe have even stricter immigration requirements, yet somehow the US is bad for attempting to enforce the ones it already has.
lmao enforcing immigration laws is now fascist? yall are braindead
Living in ignorance is way dangerous than being unaware.
Let's focus on this, given its the most significant , but also the stupidest thing you said 

>So you think this guy should not be deported?

 No. He is a legal resident. 

The first amendment protects his right to free speech, assembly, and to petition his government. 

He has not committed, or been charged with a crime, yet he is still being illegally detained. 

You cannot claim to give a shit about America, and in the same breath be so willing to ignore the very document that makes America, America. 

You're an embarrassment
They just tossed a Canadian lady into a detention center while trying to get a VISA at the fucking border, not even in the US, so instead of letting her get the paperwork sorted out and trying again. They shipped her from near San Diego to Arizona. 

Trying to enter legally and still detained.
💯 youre right. Reddit is full of left winged geeks downvoting you.
the Democratic party is the party of corporatist shills lol? 

Def not the party being headed up by....checks notes...the world's richest businessman, and a career conman? 

The same party that just ran a [Tesler used car](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/zUShVQPfIC) on the White House lawn? Or tried to shill us Goya beans? (Hatch act violations btw)

Who in addition to Elmo, had the front row of his ~~Nazi rally~~ inauguration stuffed with Zuckerberg, Bezos, and Pichai?

The party that's gutting the social safety nets for millions of Americans, in order to give billionaires and corporations tax cuts?

Couldn't possibly be those guys - they're all about the working man! 

You are a fucking joke. And the irony after you tried calling someone out two days ago with some bullshit about ""wahhh, don't facts matter anymore?!?!"" 

Gtfoh 🤡

Genuinely astonished at the sheer blind hypocrisy and stupidity of that claim, even coming from you - and that's saying something
I'm not even going to bother responding to this slop.
Almost everyone in the U.S. except for indigenous people and people whose ancestors were enslaved is the descendant of an immigrant. I couldn't care less how you got to this country. One of the great things about the U.S. is that we historically have been easier to immigrate to than most countries in the world.
Not having the slightest iota of anger by his message and going on to support him of his legal rights shows how the enemies are within.
The only embarrassment is you and everyone that thinks like you. That POS comes on a student visa and creates rallies that disrupts campuses, destroys property, prevents Jews from going to class, and incites violence against Jews. Stop bullshitting yourself and thinking “oh gee, this is a 1st amendment issue”. 

The voters have elected DJT to end this crap and it’s getting done, Nazi scum. Now go lick the boots of Hamas.
youre a shill
The truth is alway offensive to the party offending. 

If patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel then taking offense is the last refuge of the liberal.

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So the constitution just isn't important anymore, simply because it doesn't allow you to be intentionally cruel to those who disagree with you.

Good to know. 

Funny tho how it's the most important document ever made when it comes to owning guns, but brown people's rights? Nah we don't apply it in those situations. 

And you're talking enemies within lol.

The irony is palpable. 

Go deepthroat more billionaire boot
MAGA is the enemy unraveling our nation, every bit of its fabric
Your lack of self awareness is on another level. 

I guess that's why the career conman, pedophile rapist, traitor to the United States constitution that you worship and base your entire personality on said it out loud ""I love the uneducated""

Guy could shit in your hands, tell you it was pudding, and not only would you gobble it up before he had a chance to velcro his diaper back on, you'd beg him for seconds. You're a fucking imbecile. The world would be better off had you ended up as just another load on your mom's tramp stamp.
And you're an idiot troll

You aren't from Newark, don't live in Newark, and have never participated in r/Newark before. Go back to circlejerking in fantasyland, aka r/conservative.

Sure thing igor
You are really torturing the idea of the truth here
Another NPC non response / appeal to authority. 

What did I post that is not true? Either tell me or STFU. 

Literally everything this clown posts are lies. Pure propaganda. 

I will state it for you again. 

If you are a citizen you cannot be deported. 

If you have a valid visa and have not violated the terms thereof you cannot be deported. 

Outside of expedited removal ( which has limited due process checks), you cannot be deported without a full immigration hearing. 

The current administration is targeting convicted felons and those with existing removal orders because they are the low hanging fruit. Felons who are not citizens are subject to immediate deportation."
Puerto Rican military vet from ICE raid?	Anybody know what happened to the military vet that got taken by ICE in Newark, NJ?	0.76	https://reddit.com/r/Newark/comments/1id59au/puerto_rican_military_vet_from_ice_raid/	20	1id59au	2025-01-29 21:32	"He was detained with the group, once proving he was a citizen, he was let go. Didn’t get sent to jail or deported or anything. At least that’s what I was told from a friend in Newark PD
You know... maybe.. nvm 😭😭😭
I'm still waiting to get nabbed by ICE. Fly me straight to Luis Munoz Marin airport. I could use a 2 week deportation.
When they realized he was legal, he was let go. Do you think they sent him to Puerto Rico or something? Lol

out with it
When he was able to **prove he was legal** he was let go. 


Why the fuck does a Puerto Rican citizen need to prove they're  American? They're born citizens of this country. 
Yes they did in fact
Nothingness doesn't absolve the fact he was wrongly captured to begin with

Why round him up too if they already have a list of suspects to go through? Clear cut discrimination was the only reason he was detained to begin with
Both agendas? What’s the lefts agenda? Not getting illegally detained?
He was detained , then let go. He wasn’t taken anywhere.

Buying a beer and being asked for ID and being detained by a federal law enforcement agency without reason or proof of committing a crime are two very and completely different things that I can't even imagine how you find comparable at all?? You should definitely break down that thought process and spell it out for us 

People hire criminals. Plenty of jobs outside of the area this occurred in, all around the country, hire criminals. Even the legal criminals born here, that's not unheard of

The very government itself uses criminal labor as well (the fires in California being helped put out by brigades of firemen made entirely up of incarcerated criminals is proof of that) 

Again, criminals with jobs all around the country, legal or not, is not unheard of 

What is unheard of is ICE detaining a legal citizen without proof he committed any crimes, detained just for looking Hispanic/Latino which made them question his legality and when detainment should only be allowed for the person that is on ICE's list as an active suspect (which would make more sense)

Great points but you didn't throughly understand what I said about **every business in America has or does employ criminals, including the government when they need them, which also include illegal immigrants**
**Of course they're being exploited, you think I'm stupid? I never once insinuated otherwise or denied that fact** 

Hiring an illegal might be a crime to some degree, but **you won't see businesses and industries of any kind all across the spectrum of commerce in this country change their tune anytime soon, the practice is highly profitable** 

Pandora's Box cannot be closed and it's contents returned, until it's made a punishable offense to hire illegal migrants, it's going to be the way business will run their affairs until the end of time. **What are you gonna be able to do to stop that and change their minds?**
[deleted]
[deleted]
[deleted]
[deleted]
**So how and when do we go after the employers of all industries throughout commerce in this country if we clearly haven't by now and have no interest to, so we leave an agency like ICE to do it for us while they too break the laws while doing so?**
[deleted]
**Employers must do a lot of things, but they don't, clearly** 

Including verification of their own employees, a body is a body to businesses, and some businesses need bodies, and they take what they can get 

**Just because everybody should do something, you think they'll actually do it, especially at this point? That's pure cope**

**You wish business worked that way, and I do too to a certain degree, but it clearly doesn't**
**The law that let everyone that participated in the years leading up to the crash of 2009 largely go free except for their one to three fall guys? That law? The law that prioritizes profit over what's right?**
And if they don't, what would you say then? Sorry? Like I care about anything about a sorry lmao

An ""I was totally wrong"" could be a start 

Same would go for me, but again, this is the same law and lawmakers and a CEO in charge that all existed in 2009, and participated and profited in the crime of robbing its own taxpayers and tanking the economy for gain

We'll have to see, but it's not looking so good so far for your hopes of a ""clean"" govt and business practices when the same people responsible for the greatest heist in history are running the show
[deleted]
[deleted]
**You really think every single thing in a proposed package will come to fruition just because it's promised to you?**

**Half of that could come true and the other half can be denied or never done for whatever reason they see fit**

**Just because one proposed thing (that looks great to his voters) came true, there is no absolute guarantee or solid unbreakable proof everything proposed will have to come true?**

Trump was a CEO in 2009, like the rest that profited highly from the stock market crash

Just because he's president doesn't mean he doesn't have his CEO buddies and tendencies (Trump and Melania coin are the most recent examples his old habits that are dying hard) 

He can grant you this, easily, but there's no promises or guarantees he will change the law to hurt the profit of his friends and their industries
Prosecute which businesses exactly

**I remember when just about one to three people were prosecuted for the crash of 2009, when you and I know there was a whole lot more than that participating and profiting**

From then on, it only proves how nothing would ever come about properly prosecuting businesses and upholding them to the law, that's pure cope, especially almost 20 years after this happened
[deleted]
And i'm telling you, the government, that let the very constituents and taxpayers down in 2009 (and might I add, let the blame be thrown to the migrants then too) is not going to go after employers because they see no reason to harm the economy in any way, especially right now as it stands (anything like 2009 happens again, and we're going down hard) 

Everything else might be reasonable if they enforce it, but not going after employers. That's, to them, a preposterous statement and proposal

**You both are veterans, but if you're not visibly Hispanic/Latino, that's where the commonalities end and where you won't be able to understand why this specifically happened to this particular veteran, because if you're not Latino/Hispanic, it'll never happen to you the way it might happen to that individual again in the future**

It's not the fault of not enforcing the laws prior to the crises, **it's the fault of ICE for blatantly discriminating against someone that happened to fit the physical profile of a migrant (Latino/Hispanic looking) without any single proof** this is the person they were looking for or without reason to detain him at all, **it's was an undeniable breach of rights towards an American citizen, all allowed by the president in the name of national security. Frankly at this point, ICE could kill someone that looks like a migrant in cold blood and Trump would also justify it by saying it was a tragedy, but done in the name of national security. Just a part of the job that ended unfortunately, and nothing else would come of it, everything would continue as it's been for the past few weeks**"

Immigrants is what make Newark great , obviously the gangs and anybody linked to one has to go. But celebrating random store employees getting deported is weird

I'm just amazed the mayor never did a press conference when that drunk cop killed the other cop and then dragged their feet charging the guy. But this ice thing he  couldn't get a press conference up fast enough. This was nothing but a way to make him look good for his governor run.
I’m not. Already got reports of harvest going unpicked for fear. Already think going out to restaurants is too expensive this will just make it worse. Just hope the inflation effects will be lesson learning not economy ruining.
Yeah man gotta get those fish sellers out of here
If by cleaned up you mean ICE detaining known criminals; then yes. I feel bad for the non criminal illegals who get caught up in these raids.
I feel bad for the people having their life being turned upside down (I'm being 100% serious), no one should have to suffer that. That being said, I believe that will lead to more jobs being posted (I have been struggling to find work for a while now) to replace them. Maybe it will be my chance to get back into the work force (it's sad this is the cost, but I can't afford to stand on my morals anymore).

Man I feel that, swear this job market doesn’t  make sense. But would want to ask if attention is place in right place. Jobs these people have tend to be paid low sometimes even below legal limits not just fair market rates. Are we expecting people to accept this rates? If not and the rates do increase do we expect for loss profits to be eaten? I don’t and all I heard last year is how inflation is too high already, so why introduce more inflationary measures?
I think you had me confused with your mama.

Goodnight grampy, remember to take your meds and here is a kiss goodnight to your sack of nuts 😘
Swapped out the white hoods for red hats.
I hope you're never put into my position of lacking work.
Thank you
I’ll never be in a position where I’m hoping someone’s life falls apart to make up for my own hard times. 

I hope you find work soon but I hope you stop seeing it as a zero sum game even more.
This is the reality of the world (unfortunately) if some one in an accounts payable role (for example) is laid off (like I was) it is their loss and someone else's gain.

 I don't like that the world is like that, but it is. Also I never said I was hoping they would be deported (said quite literally the opposite), but I'm looking at the silver lining of this tragedy (small it may be). Also also, thank you for wishing me luck.

Edit 

Thank you for your kindness
If you were truly laid off, you lost your job because the company can’t pay you, not to hire someone else. Direct this resentful (?) energy to the reasons why your company failed. Blaming immigrants, even as a silver lining, just doesn’t make sense. Your job is gone, not filled by someone else.

Edit: also the more people stop scapegoating immigrants for everything that’s wrong, the less credible the raids/policy’s seem. Just saying.
My job at the company is not gone, I keep tabs on the company ( I have one friend who still works there and was not affected by the layoffs) they replaced 30 of us with lower wage workers (no they were not illegals as far as I know). I do hate the company for it, but at the end of the day it is what it is.

Also again I do not blame immigrants, my grandparents were immigrants if anything I am sympathetic toward them.
Then respectfully, your initial comment is irrational. The targets of the raids seem to have played no part in you losing your job, and won’t effect your ability to find a new once since you were replaced by cheaper, documented workers.    

Rereading your comment it really seems like an attempt to give the smallest bit of moral justification to an action you clearly understand to be immoral. 

What’s happening is horrible and if you take some joy, happiness away from it…I think that’s kinda fucked up and wrong. Idk that just why I commented.
I never said the immigrants played a part in me losing my job i just said it would open up more jobs
If you understand that illegal immigration wasn’t the cause of you losing your job, you probably understand that opportunities can arise regardless of it as well, so yeah seems like a moral justification"

They detained until they verify, nothing to see here. Nice try Diddy.
I heard only 3 people were working there illegally. I doubt sending 3 people back to whatever is going to raise prices that much.
I already know I'm going to get downloaded to hell for this. A large portion of the people who voted for Trump do not want to see this sort of indiscriminate harassment of our people but only wanted violent illegal criminals removed from this country.

 They were given a choice between someone who allowed a completely open border, allowing criminals to freely enter this country and someone who promised to fix this issue, albeit problematically. 

An argument could be made that if Biden had had a more comprehensive immigration plan this issue might have not even been a campaign topic which helped Trump get elected. Both sides are shit.

Are you 30 going on 78?
People like you who don't know what the hell they're talking about are why we have Trump.
the border wasn't completely open lol
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/trump-biden-immigrants-deportations.html

Biden deported more than Trump, but allowed more immigrants in because more immigrants were trying to come in. 

The messaging from the Biden campaign which feels like open borders along with the travesty that is NYC and the overflow that we get here in the city.... definitely turned a lot of people off


Like to this day, I still don't know what the response was to ""migrants are living in hotels with $10,000 credit cards"" was it fake news? I honest to God don't know and it's always stuck with me. 

I've seen NYC not have enough housing for its own residents, so it's just kinda weird that they were having an immigration epidemic and dumping a boatload of money instead of focusing those dollars elsewhere.

In any case, liberal Dems have lost the culture war in regards to immigration.

I'm a believer that Newark should remain a sanctuary City and if you're here congrats you made it. 

But the border should be closed until we can figure out some economic stability.

Well actually maybe that doesn't make sense 🤔 didn't they say that the only reason prices are as low as they are now is because immigrants are essentially working for slave wages? Hmm.

It's all fucked honestly
Kamala was literally to the ""right"" of Reagan on multiple fronts including the border, you are tweakin
>someone who allowed a completely open border

I have a hundred bridges to sell you if you actually believe this.
To add to the other commenters. Trump didn’t fix anything in his first 4 years so it takes a special kind of dementia to think he’d do anything differently this time.
When people talk listen to them. He made no secret about his intentions. People like you are just as bad as those who are enjoying this happening. Ignorance isn’t an excuse
Tell me you didn’t do any real research before the election without telling me. Anyone with immigrant loved ones (or anyone with half a brain, really) could see this coming from a mile away
You can’t talk sense to Trump derange mob; brave of you for trying. 👍

There are 1000 working days left in the Trump presidency. To deport 1M illegals over that period, Trump would have to secure 1000 deportation orders a day! There aren’t enough lawyers in the country to process that kind of volume. 

Mind you Trumps base wants 14M to be deported🤷🏾‍♂️.

Ultimately only a handful of illegals will get deported. All these raids are for optics. The targets will be those with existing criminal conviction who will qualify for expedited removal. 

The real change has already happened. The border is closed and remain in Mexico is in effect. 

ICE will continue to seek out and deport the criminals. That is a law and order play. As a result, crime will go down which is a good thing. 

The collateral damage (non criminal illegals being detained and deported) is tragic but unavoidable. If democrats truly cared about the illegals they would negotiate with the republicans to minimize the collateral damage but they don’t care. It’s all about besting Trump at this point. That’s how deranged these lunatics are.
The claim that any president has ever advocated for, much less allowed, “a completely open border” is simply absurd.
It’s fascinating to see people grunt objective falsehoods with such confidence.
Here’s my upvote buddy.
Is this initiative catching murderers that snuck through the border or workers with expired visas? How many?

Also this wasnt some brand new issue in 2020. They beat the drum for this crap during election season and then follow it up with performative action. Like the wall that never got finished. Like the traps Abbott deployed.
The bright side is it is gonna be funny when all those trump supporting ironbound business owners can’t find employees to work in their overpriced shitty restaurants
It is fucked but that's not for lack of trying to make it fucked. 

The hotel thing is that the government will rent hotels cheap and house migrants in them as a transition space as they're being processed through the immigration and asylum system. 

Most states have a refugee program to give them so money to live off of, often this is less than 1k/month. Looks like NYC is 180 per month per person, with additionally things like a metro card. Often they are not allowed to work at all, and this program stops if they are found to be working.

The housing problems in NYC are based largely on rents rising sharply and developments not have true affordable housing, and less on migrants being housed or receiving funds. 

Immigration is complicated, but it's mainly a red herring in this case. Immigration is not the problem. Poverty, stagnating wages and corporate profiteering are larger problem causers than immigration.
Democrats tried negotiating with Republicans while Biden was still president and they had come to an agreement, but Trump nixed it even though he held no elected office at the time.

The last thing Trump wants is for any part of government to operate in a reasonable way.

Reasonable just ain’t his thing. 

He doesn’t have anything to gain by doing good job, and he doesn’t have the knowledge base, temperament, or work ethic to do good job even if it were what he wanted. 

He didn’t even have the patience to sort the January 6 mob and refrain from pardoning the most violent ones who assaulted the cops.
That was one of the stupidest things I've ever had the misfortune to read.  Just shockingly stupid.
So did Biden ever say ""I am not for an open border?"" Probably not because if he did he would lose part of his base.
Ironbound is heavy on undocumented workers, from construction workers to restaurant/supermarker workers. Everyone will get hit hard, as labor will be exponentially more expensive, which is may be good for workers but bad for buyers.
Another TDS patient🤣

That deal would have essentially allowed the border to remain open. Conservative republicans would have never gone for it. Trump gave them cover. This is an open secret to everyone except the TDS crowd. 

Trump ran on deportations for 4 years straight and increased his share of the vote in every county in this state. Let’s not pretend that regular people are not fed up with open borders and non stop gaslighting. 

Under Trump the govt worked just fine. Crime was down and the economy was roaring. Inflation was near zero despite interest rates being negative. 

Biden was so [demented](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/us/politics/biden-age.html) that he apparently didn’t know where he was or what he was doing most of the time; yet Democrat tried to run him again. These are the people you think are loyal to the country? Putting a guy whose brains are leaking out of ears in charge is a sign of patriotism? 

As for pardons;  Biden pardoned his degenerate son preemptively; an unprecedented move. Ironically, 4 years ago, democrat spent weeks speculating if Trump will give similar pardons to his children. Surprise , surprise Trump did not pardon his children or anyone else preemptively. 
When Democrat make an accusation it usually turns out to be an admission🤡. 


Biden also pardoned the pair of Philadelphia judges who sentenced hundreds of mostly black kids to harsh sentences in private prisons in return for [kickbacks](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/18/1118108084/michael-conahan-mark-ciavarella-kids-for-cash).  Do those black kid’s lives matter?
Spoken like a true NPC🤣🤣🤣
LOL
Yup you get not argument for me. That’s why the business owners in the ironbound (and the majority of the rest of the neighborhood) shouldn’t have voted for trump.
Maybe we get a mix of increased pay for legal workers and when they raise prices and no one wants to purchase, then they have to lower prices. Smaller profit margins for owners, but that's how it should of been in the first place providing proper employment and not taking advantage of undocumented paying them pennies for hard work. I imagine the profit margins aren't really that great regardless and we're going to see a lot of places close. Going to be a bumpy uncomfortable ride for the majority of us, regardless of how it turns out.
The border has never been indiscriminately “open,”  and Congressional Republicans had no reason to agree to something they didn’t want.
It's funny because it's true.
Is it known that ironbound voted trump and that the business owners did, too? Curious where you can get this info from. Thanks.
Facts. People are acting surprised when they were warned that this would be the consequence of this election. Trump had a huge amount of support in the Ironbound section. Everyone always thinks it won’t be their neighborhood that gets hit.
People dont know what they’re voting for. “Woman president bad!! Egg prices and gas prices lower good!!!”
They are so dumb. Fur real
Even liberal cope is delusional🤣🤣

Border isn’t open but 3M people managed to cross it in [2024](https://homeland.house.gov/2024/10/24/startling-stats-factsheet-fiscal-year-2024-ends-with-nearly-3-million-inadmissible-encounters-10-8-million-total-encounters-since-fy2021/) alone🤡

Democrats let more than 10M illegals into the country over a period of 4 years. That is a conservative estimate. Real number is likely closer to 15M. 
Thats more than all the babies born in the US during that same period.
It’s funny because it’s absurd.
The IB is a hotbed of Trump supporters
They made it up so they can scapegoat the victims of the raid. Guess it’s easier to say “I told you so” than to have empathy.
Yup between being polluted to shit and full of republicans I don’t understand why everybody shills so hard for that neighborhood. If I want to live around republicans there’s plenty of other less polluted and cheaper places to live.
So much this.
Ha ha ha. You alright.

While the Ironbound has more than enough outspoken and tacky Trump supporters, i doubt they outnumber democrats even there. Newark as a whole went for Biden 7/1 in 2020.
Maybe not outnumber but there’s enough

So the US veteran who was detained is here illegally and a criminal? Weird hole in your story.

""The owner told CBS News that his manager tried to show his veteran’s card, but the agents did not accept it.""
This country doesn't have the tradition of Nazi-occupied France where cops go around asking everyone for their papers.
The US Military Veteran did ID himself. The ICE agents claimed his IDs are fraudulent. Fake IDs for booze are like a teen’s passtime. Your ID is fake until proven otherwise
We knew it was gonna happen here
I think the ice hotline has been blowing up from people in the Ironbound.  I don’t know why it was that but I have it on good authority it was
The link looks the same
Oh you’re one of those people that makes those viral first amendment videos. Just ID yourself what are you trying to hide my man. Let the law enforcement do there job. Or you can whine just don’t call them when your having a home invasion
Detained and promptly released, how else do you determine who is legal and who isn’t . Enlighten me
Why here?
Your link has /amp/ in it. Anyway, thanks for the link.
The idea that someone shouldn’t call the police in a situation where they are needed because…they disagree with the idea that carrying identification is near mandatory is so strange lmao.

You’re 100% right if it’s any other situation.

I'm asking about Newark, though, not Staten Island.
I guess in Newark you just pull out a 9 mm on your own accord, alright I get that
He’s talking about people who are offering to marry people in order to get them a green card. I know somebody personally who did that for somebody, so it is an actual thing. The person who wants to become a citizen pays someone a bunch of money to marry them.

At least in nazi germany the population didn’t vote them into power. It’s actually worse given we could have avoided the worst outcomes if enough Americans were opposed to fascism. Unfortunately that’s not the case.

Sorry but this is old the raid happened last week before trump took over so you can’t blame this one on him
I promise you the veteran wasn’t white
Some Hispanics literally gave the fascists the front door key.

Sadly, the immigrants who got here and who voted for him will be the first one's crying when they pick up their relatives and kids to cage them up. 

The prison industry's big money. They're not shipping these people away asap. No, they gotta keep them here, so that their friends and their friends friends can make some money. And now all you investors, you're stuck options will go up and there you have it, the savior has made this world a better place again.

This happened yesterday

So gross. Worse than the folks they complain about

  
Ban me, Nazis
Love all the tough guys over the phone but you would never say anything to anyone face
Except none of the people in today's raid were any of those things

Just average people living, and even a legal citizen that served and was told they were lying about serving

One of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned. This egregious act is in plain violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees ‘the right of the people be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures….’

“Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized. I will be holding a press conference in alliance with partners ready and willing to defend and protect civil and human rights. Details to come.”
Does anyone know what business this was?
Ha. Says the man who knows and probably invited multiple three letter agencies in a shiny building by Penn Station. They have been there for years.
They are wasting no time it seems. Wonder how the agents will determine who “looks” like a citizen and who doesn’t
Disgusting.

Some of you voted for this.

E: (The act, not the statement)*
I wish the bill of rights had teeth. Like it's a law, and if a representative of the government violates a right, they face criminal charges, as opposed to only maybe being liable for civil penalties, which are usually borne by the government and not the individual.
ICE are fascist slave catchers who snatch people just trying to go to work and make a living. Kudos to Baraka for standing up against them. We must not allow Trump's goons to destroy vibrant immigrant neighborhoods like the Ironbound.
They detained citizens. No one is safe. This is Nazi Germany. We know who they are going to target.
News reports I have seen about raids in other places it was one's with criminal records like gang members and people with serious records that states didn't tell ice about. So well he's mentioning the US vet he's quiet about the other ones
Without Law , there is a freeforall and anarchy. Immigration laws exist for a reason 


ICE enforces immigration law. ICE detains and removes(deports) persons to their respective country. Entering the country without inspection  is a removable offense and a federal misdemeanor.  Overstaying a visa a a removable offense as well. Both of these offenses are typically ignored and go unenforced  or deferred for years .  But criminality while in a undocumented  is grounds for deportation under law. 
These agents are targeting persons adjudicated as removed or removable because of  a  felony level criminal conviction in American courts.   

I don’t understand  the outrage

using an incidence of a false arrest, bad intelligence, mistaken identity or some other administrative error to make immigration law unenforceable or meaningless is problems in itself
Mayor Baraka is a criminal, and an ex Gang member himself
I hope they clean up the Ironbound, it’s so disgusting around here the quality of life. They don’t respect the community, constantly shitty on it. it’s so obvious they’re here for one thing only and it’s to sponge as much as they can off us.
Being detained is different then being arrested and charged, and yes if your here on an expired visa, have warrants or committing crimes wouldn’t you want them in jail, I’m not understanding the logic behind your argument.
[deleted]
Everyone keep your panties on.

If you are a US citizen you cannot be deported. I gather the vast majority of you don’t know how deportations work. No one gets pulled off the street and put on a plane to Mexico pronto. We are actual a nation of laws; not that you would suspect it walking into a CVS🤣 

USICS bears the burden of proving the country of origin for each potential deportee to an immigration judge. Then, the country of origin is notified and has to agree to accept the deportee. Then you have appeals. If you have a standing contribution to the ACLU; you will likely be paying for those. Only then does the illegal immigrant get put on a plane. 

All of this is both time consuming and expensive; hence the move by ICE to target those with records, convictions and existing deportation orders. This is low hanging fruit. The paper work is either all or mostly complete. Round up a few of these cases and parade them for the cameras; satisfy the base and piss off the liberals. Win; win. That is the extent to who which this will go.

The idea that “millions” of people can and will be rounded up and put on planes back to “Mexico” is pure conjecture. Red meat intended feed the fever dreams of the simpletons that make up the base of both parties. 

PS> 

1. The guys being rounded up are really bad dudes. ICE taking them is a good thing 
2.Baraka should do the job he has. 2 weeks in a row now the recycle on my street has not been collected.
It is important to note that not only illegal immigrants are being targeted, but also people who were born in the US but their parents are not. I think everyone knows by now that Trump is trying to abolish the 14th Amendment of the Constitution that states that anyone who is born in the US is automatically a US citizen. I do understand that illegal immigration is an issue because some only come to cause violence. That ruins it for many who are genuinely coming for refuge because there is a situation in their country. 

However, I believe the new administration has pure hatred towards people of color, especially African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Instead of building a wall, why not build a place of shelter and refuge for them under the supervision of US government that can figure out where an immigrant can stay and thrive legally, and turn away the ones who are only here for trouble? 

There are many new apartment complexes in development, but not near one of them is being dedicated to those in refuge. It is dedicated to those who are rich, biased, and looking for a way to escape their community because there are people who are different from them and whom they deem dangerous moving into their neighborhoods. This is also known as gentrification. Why try to shut down places of inclusivity? 

This all because of the spreading of propaganda. Many want the world to believe that people of color are the enemy. The media can tell the world that people of color want to steal jobs and become the bosses. This is similar to what ""The Führer"" said about Jews and how they were planning to become the bosses and leaders of many in Germany. 

What is similar about Hitler and Trump is that they have their idea about an ideal place. Hitler wanted a world where there were only blonde, blue-eyed, pure-white Germans. If you did not fit this category, you would be tortured because Nazis, appointed by Hitler did not only kill Jews. They killed Blacks, the disabled, the elderly, communists, and anyone that opposed their party. 

Trump wants a country where there are only pure-white men in power, much like the Confederate States. He wants the rich in power, which is why he appointed people like Elon Musk. He does not want any person of color in the country, let alone in power, which is why many are disappointed that people of color still voted for Trump. He is planning to not only deport illegal immigrants, but also those who are. 

This is why it is so important to look into every candidate running for a political position. Know what a government decision means for not only the country, but the communities you live and go to. If you are worried about the economy, know where the money is going to if a government is planning to make a decision. Research is very important before casting a vote. 

I would also like to come back to the topic of propaganda because I do have a hot take. Many people like to argue that immigrants will take their jobs, but in a lot of cases, they take blue collar jobs that Americans do not even want. We tend to look down on blue collar jobs such as being a garbage worker, but if your goal is living comfortably and having financial security, garbage workers make a lot more money than you think, sometimes even more than teachers.

Therefore, many of us need to reconsider what the ""American Dream"" looks like for us. Many would argue that it does not exist because it is simply unattainable. However, would you consider that we all have our own version of an ""American Dream""? We might not live every aspect of this concept such as ""the white picket fence"", but there is always a way to feel more content about our lives as Americans. What does the ""American Dream"" mean to us? Does it mean a white collar job that pays the bills and makes us feel superior? Does it mean being open to new experiences that may not seem ideal or popular but does have its pros? Does it mean taking the ""easy route"" and becoming a social media personality? Does that mean working hard towards following our dreams in order to land a job we're passionate about?

 In addition, many Americans do not take advantage of the privileges they have and are upset when someone from another country thrives off of that privilege. It is just like keeping a slice of pizza to yourself when you know you are not going to eat it just because you don't want anyone else to. For example, in America, there is free education, but many of us do not like school and do not at least try to do well. Then, when we are upset that an immigrant from South America gets a full ride to a top university in the country and from there, graduates with honors and gets an amazing and fulfilling job making six figures. Maybe that immigrant was in a worse position than us and wasn't satisfied with their life, so they took advantage of the opportunities in America in order to live a better life. 

Many in America are in a survival state of mind, where they are living, but not exactly thriving. They do not put in the work in order to thrive and live a life of fulfillment. Though many of us are only citizens, there is still something we can do. We can research and elect leaders that actually want to improve our country and not change it into what they believe it should be, which is very totalitarian. We can be more open to new ideas presented. We can attend city held meetings. We can be more involved in our community. We can educate those who are younger than us. We can look for opportunities in our country that are within our reach. We tend to stay stagnant or go back to our outdated laws and ways of thinking, hoping for things to change in our country. 

Illegal immigration is only part of the issue, but it is the hatred many have for people of different backgrounds, the anger we feel when those people thrive in environments where we didn't take the advantages as a US citizen, the inability to conduct deep research in order to know our candidates and government, the blindness to propaganda, the inability to understand the situation of each immigrant that wants to move into our country, the inability to feel content and humble with our lives in America despite its flaws, the inability to move forward and thrive as a country, and much more.
Or wild take and I know I’m going out on a limb here follow immigration law. I know for some people this will be too much to process.
Be vigilant everyone. They don't care if you are a citizen 
Aka they kidnapped and illegally detained  veteran who served this country because he wasn’t the right color.

It is never going to be enough for these Nazis.
Been standing idly by while the entire city has turned to shit but you draw the lines at ICE raids?
Echoing this. I understand not naming the businesses so they don’t get further hurt but for any of us who work in organizing, it would be helpful to know the kind of business being targeted and how they gained access. If anyone knows and wants to pm so it’s not public I’d appreciate.
I have a friend who works for the government and he told me that Ras is secretly allowing ICE to come in.

He wasn’t white enough. The man served his country it wasn’t fucking enough
They are executing existing warrants and or deportation orders. They have mugshot on file. 

It’s funny how liberal have so much love for criminal that they are twisting themselves into knots trying to justify their crimes.
Meanwhile they stabbin people in the streets. Lol foh get em out
There are laws under title 18 of the federal code. Deprivation of rights under the color of law. Problem is getting through the qualified immunity of ICE officers. However if you can get on film. Plead the 5th to their questions and explain to them on camera what they are doing is wrong. They lose their qualified immunity because they have been explained what they are doing is illegal and continue to do it.

That being said, I'm for Trump and the ICE raids on known illegal alien criminals and illegal aliens who skip on their immigration court dates. 
However picking out people who the ICE officers just have a hunch that might be here illegally without probable cause is bullshit and unconstitutional. I knew something like this was going to happen because of the nature of law enforcement in this country. We need to enforce immigration law heavily but ICE needs to respect the rights of people where they don't have probable cause to make an arrest.
Nazi America
They arrested a us citizen and told him his papers were fake. A veteran. This is what the fuck you voted for
That’s not true at all. They’ve already arrested US citizens since the Inauguration on Monday
Yes, it was quite the rollercoaster for the son of one of the most famous black authors of the 20th century to join the crips, then go to Howard and become a high school principal and politician. It’s such an improbable story, part of it didn’t happen.
What happens when citizens are detained, like what happened here? Going without warrants and just grabbing people is highly problematic and should be an affront to every person who believes in our Constitution and democracy.
The indignity? The unlawful detention?
The person was a fucking us citizen
Source?
Those people were arrested back in December.  

Did any of the people arrested today have pending charges?
Per the source you yourself posted, these individuals were apprehended in December 2024….so let’s thank President Biden for taking such a tough stance on immigration.
Let’s not cloud the argument with facts, OK?
So ice can illegally detained a us citizen without a warrant? For what?
I guess you’re unfamiliar with detaining people
Very well said
Neither do many Americans unfortunately, as this was always expected to be one of the main consequences. I want illegal immigration curbed as much as anyone, but this is not how you do it.

On that note, I'm wondering if I should call ICE on some legal Hispanic Trump supporters I know? This is what they voted for, after all.
This is Nazi germany
Can local police arrest federal agents for kidnapping
By what metrics has the entire city turned to shit?
Sounds like a reliable source
I have a friend who knows your friend and he said he is lying to you cause you’re gullible
ICE is federal. As a mayor, Ras doesn't have the authority to ""allow them in"" or stop them. Your friend is pulling your leg.
So you're in favour of warrantless searches?
Thank you, this is a reasonable take on this. 
I also support Trump and deportations however I feel like he’s trying to rush it so much that things aren’t being properly carried out and are getting sloppy.
Yup, they arrested a us citizens and veteran. Without a warrant. Told him his vet papers were fake.
I didn't vote for it go yell at the majority of America I'm just asking for something to read.
I did a quick Google search of us citizens being arrested on the news section and I don't see a single story mentioning this at all.
In both right  and left leaning news reports it's the same story undocumented immigrants with criminal it's one of the rare times I have seen both sides actually agree on what's being done. I would think the us citizens are either being detained in the sweep and being let go or they are being hit with charges for employing the illegals in general
But its not highly problematic when illegal immigrants are out here runnin wild im the streets? Lol are your priorities w the city or w the illegals?
Cool than he wont have an issue

Gooooo Brandon!
It would be helpful if you had the slightest clue about the law; but then again that’s too much to ask on this sub 🤷🏾‍♂️ . 

Law enforcements officers have the right to detain anyone that they reasonably suspect of committing a crime or of aiding and abetting the commission of a crime. They can also detain a person in furtherance of an investigation into a crime. 

Detentions are not arrests. An arrest means you are being detained because you are suspected of having committed a crime. When you are detained, you are not a suspect, when you are arrested you are. 

A warrant is not required for either if the officer either witnesses the alleged crime himself or has reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed in which the detained person was involved. The interpretation here is broad. 

Warrants are typically used post facto; when the crime has already been committed or in anticipation of a crime.

 These rules apply to everyone regardless of immigration status. 

What is happening here is ICE is tracking down known criminal aliens ( those who have committed crimes in addition to the crime of being in the country illegally).
When they encounter such a person, it is reasonable for them to suspect those in the company of the criminal to be and associate; hence the detention.
“There’s some people I don’t like and I mean, well, they are Latino, so I guess I can make this work for me.”

That’s what you sound like.  Let’s all not volunteer for the gestapo just yet
Do it. They wanted the leopards, let them get the leopards.

Do it.
Absolutely do it! I have a few people to report as well 👊🏿
No it isn’t. Hyperbole is one thing but this is bordering on delusion🤦🏾. 
What’s wrong with liberals? 
What ICE is doing is the equivalent of the US Marshalls going after inmates that have broken out of prison en masse. 
Literally every one of the individuals being detained are hardcore criminals.
If they were natural born citizens; every clown on here would be clamoring for them to be arrested; because they are illegals, we are supposed to let them roam about free?
He can sue the government. Arresting someone without a warrant violates the 4th amendment but with this sc I don’t know anymore
Is that a joke? Youre in University Heights take ride over to 2nd st & central ave and hang out for a few minutes. its an open air drug market. There are daily shooting all over the city. People getting stabbed by ms13 members in front of bars over the summer. You posted a recording and bitched about someone driving the wrong way down a street at night. You havent the slightest clue what is going on in that city if thats what youre worried about.
Do you homie.
Werd. I should have been specific. He’s essentially aware that they’re coming and made it clear to ICE he would turn a blind eye to them privately, but will publicly say otherwise. I trust my friend and his intel. He’s been spot on with various things he’s told me that’s happened in the country, NJ, and Newark in the past. All good if you don’t believe him.
Are they targeting people who are here illegally?

Suits suits suits left and right for any legal citizen detained under clear cut discrimination
If they have committed a crime, there is a such thing as due process that even non-citizens have a right to. Nobody seems to remember the poem.

Once you give a reason why the rule of law can be suspended, you've already lost, because we all know they will not stop with ""detaining"" undocumented people or people unlawfully in the country. If that was the goal, there's a number of other ways to approach the problem, one of which had bipartisan support in Congress, but Trump told Republicans not to give Biden a win, so they voted it down.

They arrested him without a warrant. Illegally
Being detained can lead to getting to work or something on time and getting fired. They need a suspicion of a crime to legally detain someone and looking like a certain race isn't that. Officers/agents shouldn't be able to just harass and detain US citizens, they need to do their job right and find a legal way to find those committing crimes.
Baraka’s statement mentions the raid happened today though.
Hey my bad
Without a warrant? He is a us citizen so what is the probable cause he is illegally here? His race?

So basically I must be illegal because of close proximity to others? And they accuse him of having fake papers.

This shit is Nazi germany on steroids.
I was being sarcastic to make a point.
Live by the rule of never reporting anyone to ICE, even if you think they deserve it.
Targeting us citizens is fascism. Why was this person detained without a warrant? Why was he accused of faking papers?
We should not bring lawsuits against men who carry swords. The only solution is open defiance of federal authority backed up with force of arms
Newark still has it's issues, sure. But 'turned to' shit?

Newark is so much better than it was 20 years ago. Crime is way down, and has been trending that way for a decade. Every city still has crime, it's part of living in a society with other humans. 

Not sure what scouring my profile and pulling that random video has to do with everything, but I understand that you're grasping pretty hard.
What various things has he been previously spot on about?
This is most likely true. ICE is targeting hardcore criminals. Getting them off the streets is good for Baraka. 

Because he can’t do it himself without the lunatic left accusing him of being xenophobic. So this is likely the only way he can get these criminals off our streets .
Answer the question
Being detained does not mean you have been arrested. Detainment occurs when law enforcement temporarily restrict your freedom to investigate their suspicion that you may be involved in a crime.  I'm sure he's already out and not under any criminal charges.
Yes you fool. If you drive drunk at 2 am, the cops arrest you on the spot. They don’t have to go wake a judge up to get a warrant to lock you up. 

The same concept applies here. If you are in the company of a known violent criminal with an outstanding warrant. Cops have reasonable cause to arrest you as well.
Leave if you have a problem with it
A subtle one.  I’m so relieved.

Tactically: if the gays report the hispanics, who reports the gays? The muslims?
._. But ehh didn’t they make it harder to obtain firearms?
Lol keep telling yourself that. Where tf are you even from? Do you even live there? Go tell the families of these kids getting killed that “things are so much better than 20 yrs ago tho”. Go drive down 18th by home depot and tell me there isnt an immigration issue. Talk to the cops in the city, a lot of them grew up there. Its not good
100% if they are targeting people who are here illegally
They said his veteran papers were fake and didnt have a warrant. Illegal. I hope he sues the fuck out of them
Criminal charges for what? They didn’t have a warrant! Are you listening to yourself?
Except these people detained weren't violent criminals, they're just average people that happened to be picked up by ICE, including one legal veteran that had no reason to be picked up other than clear cut discrimination from ICE
Oh wow. And they falsely accused him of having fake papers. It will never be enough with these Nazis
State and local police have no issue getting all the weapons they need
You're an idiot. You scoured my profile and couldn't figure out that I live in Newark? 

Yet, you keep saying ""there"" so you clearly don't. Pretty confident I've got a better idea what's happening in Newark

Why not fuck off out of our sub - you've evidently got no reason to be here, and I'm pretty confident the majority don't want you here either. 

Shouldn't you be busy cutting eye holes in bedsheets or something?
There's no if clause - you're either in favour of warrantless searches or you're not. You clearly are.

Very unpatriotic of you. 

So how do you decide which parts of the constitution to just willfully ignore, and which parts to defend tooth and nail? Just willy nilly like choosing a pair of socks?
I'm done you obviously already have what happened all set in your reality and not listening. Good luck pace yourself it's going to be a long four years. I would hate to see you have a meltdown breakdown so early we are only in day four of his presidency
That is completely false. Facts please
Again; how do you know he was falsely accused? If he is a veteran and has done nothing wrong, he will be fine.
Where are you from?
You are ok with Nazis detaining citizens with no warrants. Veterans. For what? For not being white?
""A spokesperson for ICE said in a statement:

'U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual's identity as was the case during a targeted enforcement operation at a worksite today in Newark, New Jersey. This is an active investigation and, per ICE policy, we cannot discuss ongoing investigations.'""

From the mouth of ICE themselves, targeted a legal veteran with the others and admitted it

The fact we haven't heard from anyone about any alleged violent criminal that was an immigrant being off the streets after this specific raid, **and most especially ICE raiding a business lets us infer everyone that was captured by ICE today was a worker without documentation**

Don't you think ICE would be foaming at the mouth to tell the world one of their raids captured a known violent criminal? To boast the effectiveness of their methods? 

**Of course they would, but they didn't, so it's ""we cannot discuss ongoing investigations"" because it's no one of known interest besides the legal veteran that was targeted along with everyone else that they were compelled to mention in their official statement**
So basically ice can accuse us citizens of having fake id and kidnap them . Nazi Germany
The future
He's a transplant from the UK smh
You do realize that a large group of Hispanic and black voters did vote for Trump right. The old blame it on the white people thing is a little out of date on his second term"
THANK NJ TRANSIT POLICE.	"Some weird male man was staring me down in the bathroom to the point that I just left. He postured and refused to break eye contact, had paraphernalia hanging from his pockets.

I disclosed my concerns to pd, and they took authority in the most appropriate way. They checked on the gentlemen (who was apparently still, just hanging out in the bathroom) and did not escalate. 

If you see something, if you feel as though you are being harassed— do not hesitate afraid to speak up. This generation of PD is good 👍🏽"	0.88	https://reddit.com/r/Newark/comments/1i347b9/thank_nj_transit_police/	9	1i347b9	2025-01-17 00:48	"Was at Newark penn*
Penn is full of unhoused individuals and the smell of the bathrooms is bad. I just hope they resolve this and open a homeless shelter nearby so they can bathe and eat at this place and maybe a safe place where they can use clean equipment for their stuff. It is awful arriving at Newark and seeing this.
I’m not sure you should be extrapolating one situation to an entire generation
Awesome! I’m glad to actually hear something pro police on Reddit for a change lol
Glad he wasn’t arrested or made to leave the public space and instead was checked on, helped by officers and is able to continue using being on public transit and in the “public square” with people. So often when drug addicts or the severely mentally ill or slightly deranged act in intimidating or threatening ways or are seen to be implying violence when they’re simply having a schizophrenic episode, likely fueled by drugs, the police will remove them or put them in jail or make them leave the area and get away from everyone else. Glad it all worked out!
I was downtown yesterday and had a real problem with some weird creep by Military Park. Dude followed me and got way too close- had his body like right on top of mine. I felt like he was legit about to either rip off my backpack or try and assault me in some way so I stayed calm and chatted with him. (I’m a female). It was horrible and I went into Whole Foods for safety. The store is thankfully crowded and with multiple securely guards so he took off. It was awful though. I swear you can tell when some really bad drugs get sold on the streets because the zombies start bugging more than usual. It is like 28 Days Later out here some days.
It could have gone one the three ways. Without a social network or a solution in sight, I wouldn’t be surprised if he killed me next time I saw him. 

That is, if he recognize me.
